Um and here of course is the UV layout. Uh I think uh the Quads for the most part were nice. Like I don't think any of them have any issues with quads except for the spoon. Uh I think the way I created it initially was weird. Um but to maintain the I I know some um triangles is fine just as long as it's not too many. But I ended up uh making it a flat plane which isn't the most elegant solution, but I think it's okay enough for what it's going to be used for. >> Yeah, I mean that'll work. It's just that I mean this problem should be fairly easy to fix. Like if you just delete that end gun and do the grid fill, then that'll give you quads going across here, which then you could, you know, continue to curve uh out the, you know, bowl part of the spoon. It's not going to have too much attention drawn on this particular part, at least in my opinion. But, uh, yeah, utilizing modify modifiers and the subdivision surface. Uh we're able to take a plane and map it out utilizing a reference which is I used an IKEA one which was very convenient um to uh create an otherwise mostly 3D object. So uh there's that and let's move on to the substance painter here. Um I neglected to actually uh put these all into one UV uh until basically too far into the process to change it >> um because I had forgotten to actually compile them all together. But uh there's probably a way to go about that. But otherwise uh yeah, they're they're all here anyways. They're all still packed pretty neatly into their own UV spaces, but uh here are the designs. Uh it's nothing crazy. Uh I kind of based them off of my own cutlery that I have at home. And I went for a little bit of a silly theme. Not really silly, but uh I thought it was interesting, but um uh the fancy version is a more detailed version of uh the modernized version. Like it's still following somewhat the same somewhat of the same pattern. Um and uh the antique and modern design basically share the same Um, it's just only a matter of uh maybe I I probably could remove the uh the dirt a bit uh just to make them more distinct from each other or at least different use a different kind of smart mask to uh make them more distinct from each other, but that's an easy fix. Uh here's the knife. Uh and here is the both versions. They kind of build off of each other a little bit. So, ex all except for the spoon, they kind of um share a lot of the similarities. Um this one's just a lot more extravagant, I guess. Uh it is a bit bland for the modern version. I would probably like add a little bit of a follow through here. Um if I were to do it again, but I think this is perfectly serviceable. Uh and of course, here is the spoon. I think that I uh ended up taking out the drawing tablet for the spoon um after working on the first two and realizing that it probably was the most efficient way to go about this, especially with um intricate designs. But, uh yeah, here's the modern one. I think I like the modern one a bit more, though it's probably up to preference. And the fancy one um is fancy, I guess. So, uh, yeah, that is all my stuff for the week and I hope to do more. >> Okay, that's these look good. Um, it's just this this issue here. If you've got more of this happening inside the spoon, right, we created this one to sort of, you know, create this sort of definition around these parts. And so to solve you know this issue which is coming from the smart mask you know the smart mask is just going to be some preset for the mask editor. Um wherever that dirt layer is over here. Adding a paint effect allows you to just sort of get rid of this here and choose that this effect is only going to be working down here. And so that would allow you to adjust that as well there. But those look good. Um, yeah, the, you know, sort of very minor differences between the two versions there. But, um, yeah, you did a good job, you know, putting in a lot of the detail there in in texture. And in terms of combining them afterwards, Um, I mean there's no sort of straight ahead solution there. If you bring them all back and bake them in Blender to one material.

What do you even eat with that? >> Truffles that that you've had you've had your some someone dig out of the forest or something like that >> where these are not the ones I made. Um this is my reference that I used actually use a reference this time. Um then you can see the kind of like varnish or tarnish that they have. I put that into my set as well. >> But yeah, these ones have like little flowers and leaves and petals and designs. So, I thought that was pretty cool. It cost about the same $2,500 as the one that Casey was showing us. >> I mean I mean if if we're I would have busted here going prices right rules. I would have thought that was like well I guess it depends how many play settings of of this we're getting. It looks like you know more than 25k to me but but who maybe that's just one. Just one. Yeah. >> And what do you do with that knife? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's where you eat your That's how you slice your tiny cake on a tiny plate with this and eat it with this really small. >> And then I have this is my UV layout. That all came out pretty good. Um topology wise came out very well too. This is the wireframe view. Let's get out of here. Um, so using the solidify modifier, it got a little tricky coming down to the point of the butter knife. You can kind of see where it's kind of flat and then looks weird. Um, but I had to had to split up some of the loop cuts and actually use a knife to cut in some other ones to get that roundness. Um, so it kind of looked more uh realistic. And the solidify modifier worked out very well. Um, come I messed up my fork though halfway through I when I went in out of the edit mode it was like came down and then this half right here was like on the top. So I had to erase that and start over and yeah but other otherwise it came out pretty well. I do have slight bends in both the spoon and the the fork. And then I actually went through and cut or not cut but I downsized on the knife on the Zcale scaled that down. Kind of smooshed it in there so it actually look more like a butter knife. Yeah, that's my topology for that. The silverware set. And then in painter mode, I'll start with the spoon. So you can see I put in some I stamped in >> That's good. And you mean pretty close to the right. >> Some alpha flowers and then some leaves to kind of fill in the little blank spots and then hand drew um some of the filigree uh the spoon is all handdrawn besides the alphas of course. And then I gave it the the con concrete. I think this one was a concrete one that I used uh for the tarnish. But I made a smart material as we did in class um using all the different uh noise levels and everything. That's just the base color that we did to uh blur on the imperfections, the fingerprints. So that's what the antique version looks like. And this is pretty much the the spoon, just a metal spoon like Yeah. doesn't doesn't change it very much. Um but you can see like kind of like spots or dents the grain of the metal. Get some You see like some >> Oh yeah, that's convincing. >> The fingerprint marks here. I think out. >> I mean, it's the practice here is about like paying attention and getting this kind of detail, right? I mean, like we're the application here. We're zooming in on the end of a fork, you know, like uh we're like, geez, looks great. Uh but, um that look, you know, it's a convincing metal >> very similar kind of well. and then my knife. Use the pin tool and the mirror modifier to put in these edges. Everything else was either hand or stamped. And then that's what it looks like from the side view. Kind of gives you that flat like iron. >> Backpack says that fork is a quote lent lu n salad fork. uh backpack. She's sometimes on the live streams here to um from a former class. Oh, this is a thing. Oh, I think it's a brand of This is like a silver smith. That's the the the name of the silver smithing company. Okay, that makes sense. >> An actual butter knife with it. I didn't do any of the serrations. Um I tried to do a couple little things, but they it just didn't look very well, so I just left them out. >> And um but yeah, that's that one. And then my fork. I think they came out very well. This is the first one I made, so it probably looks a lot better than the other ones. Um but same same basic setup here. >> And then let me just point out um I'm not sure if you did or didn't. This flower alpha in um Substance Painter is procedural. So when if you do indeed use this, like you can actually go in and change the petals and the inner workings and stuff to make it not look like the the default Substance Painter flower, which I would I would encourage. Um, I think you may have may have done that there, but yeah, like um it's it's like a vector thing and so you can go in and and tune its uh appearance. >> And then the tarnish little heavy on this one, but if I thin it out, it disappears from down here. Um, but yeah, there's the bargain brand Dollar Tree fork. That's pretty much it. Um, see, was there any other questions? Oh, all the same materials in the workflow is because usually when you buy the set, you're all comes from the same lot, I would assume. I don't think they would just pick and choose from random things. They're probably all made with the same materials. Um, so it's it's nice to make them look more uniform, you know, so they're actually like a set. I would that's why I would think all the utensils use the same material >> and then well from the from the viewpoint of the actual utensil manufacturing yes absolutely from our standpoint it's like we just want to load one set of textures into the memory right so we're just trying to be um efficient there but again if you take anything away from the class right you that efficiency matters right um but then there's two separate thresholds there's that like am I going to render in Blender or some other offline render environment? If so, you know, you can be much more loose, right? Um it's just much more forgiving. Whereas, is this going into a real time environment? In which case, then uh everything you can do to save computing power matters per frame, right? because the it it's totally evident in the metrics. When we talk about rendering in Blender, we're talking about seconds per frame under good conditions. If things go really poorly, then we're like, how many minutes did it take to render this frame? Um, and then in video games, we're talking about frames per second, right? So, like the whole metric is inverted. That's how much faster the rendering is. Here you when you're designing the game, you literally have a millisecond budget. How many milliseconds, right, which again is 1 1,000th of a second, can we devote to doing whatever this job is? Um, and so it matters a lot there. So both look really great. Excellent work. Um, I thought you really uh got astonishingly close to the um to the reference you you picked out there. Well done. Here's Jack. and and",

So I had to erase that and start over and yeah but other otherwise it came out pretty well. I do have slight bends in both the spoon and the the fork. And then I actually went through and cut or not cut but I downsized on the knife on the Zcale scaled that down. Kind of smooshed it in there so it actually look more like a butter knife. Yeah, that's my topology for that. The silverware set. And then in painter mode, I'll start with the spoon. So you can see I put in some I stamped in >> That's good. And you mean pretty close to the right. >> Some alpha flowers and then some leaves to kind of fill in the little blank spots and then hand drew um some of the filigree uh the spoon is all handdrawn besides the alphas of course. And then I gave it the the con concrete. I think this one was a concrete one that I used uh for the tarnish. But I made a smart material as we did in class um using all the different uh noise levels and everything. That's just the base color that we did to uh blur on the imperfections, the fingerprints. So that's what the antique version looks like. And this is pretty much the the spoon, just a metal spoon like Yeah. doesn't doesn't change it very much. Um but you can see like kind of like spots or dents the grain of the metal. Get some You see like some >> Oh yeah, that's convincing. >> The fingerprint marks here. I think out. >> I mean, it's the practice here is about like paying attention and getting this kind of detail, right? I mean, like we're the application here. We're zooming in on the end of a fork, you know, like uh we're like, geez, looks great. Uh but, um that look, you know, it's a convincing metal >> very similar kind of well. and then my knife. Use the pin tool and the mirror modifier to put in these edges. Everything else was either hand or stamped. And then that's what it looks like from the side view. Kind of gives you that flat like iron. >> Backpack says that fork is a quote lent lu n salad fork. uh backpack. She's sometimes on the live streams here to um from a former class. Oh, this is a thing. Oh, I think it's a brand of This is like a silver smith. That's the the the name of the silver smithing company. Okay, that makes sense. >> An actual butter knife with it. I didn't do any of the serrations. Um I tried to do a couple little things, but they it just didn't look very well, so I just left them out. >> And um but yeah, that's that one. And then my fork. I think they came out very well. This is the first one I made, so it probably looks a lot better than the other ones. Um but same same basic setup here. >> And then let me just point out um I'm not sure if you did or didn't. This flower alpha in um Substance Painter is procedural. So when if you do indeed use this, like you can actually go in and change the petals and the inner workings and stuff to make it not look like the the default Substance Painter flower, which I would I would encourage. Um, I think you may have may have done that there, but yeah, like um it's it's like a vector thing and so you can go in and and tune its uh appearance. >> And then the tarnish little heavy on this one, but if I thin it out, it disappears from down here. Um, but yeah, there's the bargain brand Dollar Tree fork. That's pretty much it. Um, see, was there any other questions? Oh, all the same materials in the workflow is because usually when you buy the set, you're all comes from the same lot, I would assume. I don't think they would just pick and choose from random things. They're probably all made with the same materials. Um, so it's it's nice to make them look more uniform, you know, so they're actually like a set. I would that's why I would think all the utensils use the same material >> and then well from the from the viewpoint of the actual utensil manufacturing yes absolutely from our standpoint it's like we just want to load one set of textures into the memory right so we're just trying to be um efficient there but again if you take anything away from the class right you that efficiency matters right um but then there's two separate thresholds there's that like am I going to render in Blender or some other offline render environment? If so, you know, you can be much more loose, right? Um it's just much more forgiving. Whereas, is this going into a real time environment? In which case, then uh everything you can do to save computing power matters per frame, right? because the it it's totally evident in the metrics. When we talk about rendering in Blender, we're talking about seconds per frame under good conditions. If things go really poorly, then we're like, how many minutes did it take to render this frame? Um, and then in video games, we're talking about frames per second, right? So, like the whole metric is inverted. That's how much faster the rendering is. Here you when you're designing the game, you literally have a millisecond budget. How many milliseconds, right, which again is 1 1,000th of a second, can we devote to doing whatever this job is? Um, and so it matters a lot there. So both look really great. Excellent work. Um, I thought you really uh got astonishingly close to the um to the reference you you picked out there. Well done. Here's Jack. and and"

I wasn't sure if I'm supposed to do that or not, but whatever. So, yeah. Um, yeah, you can have multiple separate meshes in the same UV space. So they can be separate objects over here but be in the same UV space over here. And you know you want to be able to unpack each uh object unwrap each object separately. Then with all of them selected pack them into one UV space. No we can hear you. Okay, Tommy, it may be kind of low on the broadcast. >> I used the solidify modifier to get the length of the object.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: Modern and Antique Designs >> And this is the antique design. I couldn't really not have it. I'm not sure how to get rid of or do only like this part to separate the bottom and top in a blender. Okay, so conceptually it's the same thing, right? And so how how would we do this in so this is a pattern that Tommy has loaded into the as a bumpnap onto the software. And yeah, Substance Painter isn't a totally separate world. It's just a convenient way to sort of stack all the layers. But the concepts are the same. If we needed to limit this so that it wasn't up here and only down here in Substance Painter, we would, you know, paint black over this to make sure that we only saw it. And so that is possible in Blender as well. Let's see here if I can pull this off without having thought about it before. But let me see. Um, where's Tommy's thing? Did you give me the blend file? You did. Okay. And Tommy, I wouldn't put commas in file names. that. Um, that may not may not be a great idea. Um, nope, that's not it. Stop. >> Stop. Uh, over here. Okay. And so here over here here. Come on, Blender. And is it dark just because there's no lights? Possibly. Maybe you may not have packaged this stuff. Let's see. Yeah, I don't think the package is there, but I think we can demonstrate this anyway. Um, if we were to get some something with a random pattern on it here. Okay, it's extreme, but you get the idea. Okay. And so, uh, let's take the displacement off the table. We don't need to deal with that right now. We're just dealing with the normal map. There we go. We've done it. We've made truly disgusting silverware. Okay. So, um we don't want to have this part be bumpy. Uh we can do a similar sort of thing. we are just going to need a place to paint, right? So essentially the it's the same um logic. We need to create a place to store paint. In this case, we're going to need to create a new image file in which to store some pixels. And then we're going to need to comp that image file onto the bump um channel here. So it'll be more laborious uh than in Substance Painter, but this is this is the value proposition of Substance Painter. And that makes that kind of thing a little bit uh less laborious. But just to be aware that this stuff exists in uh Blender and let me see, I'm going to turn off the other stuff just to not be confused about what's what. And then um let's Let's go to texture paint. Let's zoom in over here. And uh a lot of the brush the brush language has been solidified or unified as of uh uh this version. Although it looks like these are not UV unwrapped quite right. It's going to prove challenging, but let me just see if I can do this part. Okay. And when we're texturing uh painting here, I'm going to make a new base color. There we go. And we're going to paint into that some black. And Now if we come back to shading here is the step. Here's this is the image that's storing the stuff we just painted. And if I were to uh and look at this stuff, if I were to run this directly into here, there we go. You can see that that's what we painted. Um, and so now we want to use this to mask out this stuff uh going into here. And so anytime we need to mix two images, it in Blender it is a uh mix color. There we go. And so we got this one and this one. And then this one can go here. And then we can put it into Um, let's say multiply. There we go. And if we were to look at this, I'm going to take the color out of it so it's a little easier to tell what's happening. Um, yeah. So, there's some UV issues here. But, um, you can see see how it's only h the bump is only happening on the handle. Now, uh, all the crunchy stuff is just the UV conflicting there. Um, and so we've essentially done the same kind of thing you do adding another paint effect in Substance Painter, right? So this kind of like most of what you could do in substance painter you could do here but you know like those deep layer stacks you can see how that becomes problematic over here right so there really I mean the workflows are conceptually using the same stuff but um some things are easier to do in a nodal fashion some things are easier to do with a layer fair technique. But um if you know what's happening like we have this grid of pixels being added with this grid of pixels, it helps you understand both things at a very fundamental level. And so that's what you need to do there. Well, first thing you need to do, Tommy, is UV unwrap the stuff that you've got. So you weren't using substance painter so you kind of were able to sidestep that to some extent but um because yours well in this case that we're using UVs um the you can use your own textures here right and so just like by painting the black stuff in you could also um you know you did you had a pretty good substitute there of like finding something with a pattern on it and applying that to the silverware. But you could also paint your own patterns. Right? If we came back over here to texture paint and again I made a new one by hitting that plus. But if I came back to this one here, you could start to um hit F. Bring this down paint white. Um and paint your with a much harder brush. Uh, well, this is a hard brush, but it just looks fuzzy because of the because the UV problem. Um, here, let me just Anyway, you can paint your own filigree pattern doing this exact same thing, painting a white uh pattern on top, which then you fed into the um bump map would give you that raised uh appearance there, right? And then if you went and made another texture where you painted a tiny little bit of black around the parts that you painted white and then comp that in under the color, you could get the same kind of thing. You can only take this so far. A lot of the power of substance painter is that you know all of this procedural combinations of many many many layers would be like an insane uh amount of nodes here, right? Um, but yeah, so conceptually, you know, like UV unwrap yours, Tommy, and then you should be able to get um, you know, be able to paint your own filigree pattern there on on what's going on. But like again, you always have to ask yourself, right, is this a tool I'm going to be using in five years, in 10 years? Is Wonder going to exist in 10 years? You know, if I had to bet, I would say yes, right? But um but chances are we're not totally rewriting physics over that period of time and computers and so the understanding the underlying principles of how the stuff works then that helps you you know transition between things um much much better uh much more quickly versus just thinking of it as a bunch of of clicks there. Um, and you know, hopefully we're moving towards this beautiful, you know, user interface renaissance. You know, hope if the if the AI could be pointed at that in terms of, you know, not having to hide checkboxes between sub menus and being able to communicate that where it's just sort of like, I want this to be a bump map and it becomes a bump map, then, you know, that'll be beautiful. and you know like there's some cool stuff. We're like surprisingly close to that. Um so that that's one of the AI uses I'm most interested about. So doing uh the one thing the technical terms here if you want to research this stuff is that you're using right all of the typical AI stuff those are LLMs large language large language models but they just predict the next word um that's all it does I mean it's a very very very sophisticated system for doing it which has been fed the most amount of data anything has ever been fed uh ever. And that that amount is increasing every day. It's astonishing. Um but that doesn't do a whole lot to interface with even not even the real world, but even in the computer world. like it can spit out text for days and days and days, but um you know as as everyone knows at this point like it doesn't know if that text is right or not or correct and I'm totally sidest stepping the idea that we you know like it doesn't know it's not true requires us to like define truth which is you know not the point of this class but um you can start to do this with a LLM M um hooked up to an MCP server. So an MP NC MCP server, I don't remember what the acronym stands for off the top of my head. Uh essentially allows it to talk to the API of a specific application. Uh and you know all this stuff is advancing quickly. like doing that six months ago was like, you know, I was roughly paying attention to it, but even the like 40 minute YouTube tutorials were like, I gota I got it working and you're like, you know, like I don't have time for that. Um, but it's getting easier now. Um, right. All right. And so something like that looks like this, right? So this is the LLM on the left hand side and it you're inter talking to it conversationally um like you do and then it's putting together um API calls to the uh already existent Blender API, right? So, you can use Blender the way we do, clicking on stuff, or you can talk to Blender, you know, quote unquote uh directly with uh an API uh through either the terminal or something else. And so, this is kind of a way to leverage that without having to um you know, learn the entire Blender API language, right? because you guys now know like lots of Blender stuff and you can dis describe that. You've described it to me when you're speaking in these videos and now this does the job which I think it's best at in terms of translation where you can speak to it conversationally. It can translate that into reasonably good API calls and do stuff in the environment. So, um, yeah, this kind of thing I'm, you know, very bullish on, uh, where, you know, especially for like rough setting up of scenes, um, all all of this kind of stuff and then leveraging it to make, you know, perhaps, you know, procedural setups that would be, you know, a lot of clicking to get done. And so uh yeah any program with as far as I understand with some sort of established API would be able to be um accessed uh in this way and so you know if you're looking you know this is there's no uh you know the LLM was trained in the same way you know like sucking down all the text data and the API data and you know mostly a lot of code um but Uh yeah, I mean there's a lot of I think interesting um work to be done here. None of this presents the same, you know, visual ethical issues of uh you know, AI slop generation, you know, where like this no point are we dealing with like pixels that were taken from someone else at any point here. This is, you know, just controlling the API of the program. um you know just one step away from using the API scripts to do that right so I mean when this sort of stuff got you know up and running like how old is this one seven months ago you know pretty minimal kind of stuff like make a cube and then there'd be you know like I saw no less than 50 YouTube videos about you know I told Blender to make a cube and it's just sort of like you know that work needs to be done so that you know you can do something else but um Now it's, you know, just starting to get to the point where it's interesting. I've only done this a tiny tiny bit. You know, it's been more useful to spit out, you know, scripts that Python scripts that then you could use kind of like add-ons um repeatedly. So, that kind of stuff uh is great, right? And that's the that's also the next step, right? where um you know there's the standard Blender add-ons and then you know you are working on something specific and you're like man it'd be great if I had an add-on to do this like the step between conceptualizing that and having it is uh that distance is shrinking a lot. So, I think that stuff is really compelling and it's that's happening all over the place. Like every web-based most every web- based um design software has something like this happening now, right? Just the the first iteration because it was just piece of cake easy was having the LLM there in Google Docs, right? Where you're like blah blah blah blah blah rewrite this and make it sound good, you know? and then it does it. Um, but having that in other programs is really useful. Um, for instance, I was poking around in Figma over the re the weekend and so that's like a online uh without logging in can I do anything here? like a online animation tool used a lot for um like app prototyping but essentially you know it's animation that's happening in in browser here but I was looking at this to create some animated flowcharts for you guys and for my other classes um which I think would be useful um but you know like anything else it's got its own quirks and stuff, but they have a lefthand side, you know, bot that you can chat with that then can help essentially lay out the starting point and then you can get in there and move some things around. So it I mean it makes a significant difference I think in those kind of situations um where you know a lot of what I would be doing um is trying to get over the hump to get this initial stuff there but once it's all there the sort of tweaking of like no there's two arrows that go here there's three hours that go here like all that stuff is you know a little bit much easier once it's in place so I think a really compelling there. And last but not least, uh, no, we have two. Here's Isabella.",
    "transcript_segment": ">> And this is the antique design. I couldn't really not have it. I'm not sure how to get rid of or do only like this part to separate the bottom and top in a blender. Okay, so conceptually it's the same thing, right? And so how how would we do this in so this is a pattern that Tommy has loaded into the as a bumpnap onto the software. And yeah, Substance Painter isn't a totally separate world. It's just a convenient way to sort of stack all the layers. But the concepts are the same. If we needed to limit this so that it wasn't up here and only down here in Substance Painter, we would, you know, paint black over this to make sure that we only saw it. And so that is possible in Blender as well. Let's see here if I can pull this off without having thought about it before. But let me see. Um, where's Tommy's thing? Did you give me the blend file? You did. Okay. And Tommy, I wouldn't put commas in file names. that. Um, that may not may not be a great idea. Um, nope, that's not it. Stop. >> Stop. Uh, over here. Okay. And so here over here here. Come on, Blender. And is it dark just because there's no lights? Possibly. Maybe you may not have packaged this stuff. Let's see. Yeah, I don't think the package is there, but I think we can demonstrate this anyway. Um, if we were to get some something with a random pattern on it here. Okay, it's extreme, but you get the idea. Okay. And so, uh, let's take the displacement off the table. We don't need to deal with that right now. We're just dealing with the normal map. There we go. We've done it. We've made truly disgusting silverware. Okay. So, um we don't want to have this part be bumpy. Uh we can do a similar sort of thing. we are just going to need a place to paint, right? So essentially the it's the same um logic. We need to create a place to store paint. In this case, we're going to need to create a new image file in which to store some pixels. And then we're going to need to comp that image file onto the bump um channel here. So it'll be more laborious uh than in Substance Painter, but this is this is the value proposition of Substance Painter. And that makes that kind of thing a little bit uh less laborious. But just to be aware that this stuff exists in uh Blender and let me see, I'm going to turn off the other stuff just to not be confused about what's what. And then um let's Let's go to texture paint. Let's zoom in over here. And uh a lot of the brush the brush language has been solidified or unified as of uh uh this version. Although it looks like these are not UV unwrapped quite right. It's going to prove challenging, but let me just see if I can do this part. Okay. And when we're texturing uh painting here, I'm going to make a new base color. There we go. And we're going to paint into that some black. And Now if we come back to shading here is the step. Here's this is the image that's storing the stuff we just painted. And if I were to uh and look at this stuff, if I were to run this directly into here, there we go. You can see that that's what we painted. Um, and so now we want to use this to mask out this stuff uh going into here. And so anytime we need to mix two images, it in Blender it is a uh mix color. There we go. And so we got this one and this one. And then this one can go here. And then we can put it into Um, let's say multiply. There we go. And if we were to look at this, I'm going to take the color out of it so it's a little easier to tell what's happening. Um, yeah. So, there's some UV issues here. But, um, you can see see how it's only h the bump is only happening on the handle. Now, uh, all the crunchy stuff is just the UV conflicting there. Um, and so we've essentially done the same kind of thing you do adding another paint effect in Substance Painter, right? So this kind of like most of what you could do in substance painter you could do here but you know like those deep layer stacks you can see how that becomes problematic over here right so there really I mean the workflows are conceptually using the same stuff but um some things are easier to do in a nodal fashion some things are easier to do with a layer fair technique. But um if you know what's happening like we have this grid of pixels being added with this grid of pixels, it helps you understand both things at a very fundamental level. And so that's what you need to do there. Well, first thing you need to do, Tommy, is UV unwrap the stuff that you've got. So you weren't using substance painter so you kind of were able to sidestep that to some extent but um because yours well in this case that we're using UVs um the you can use your own textures here right and so just like by painting the black stuff in you could also um you know you did you had a pretty good substitute there of like finding something with a pattern on it and applying that to the silverware.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 12, 2025 High Poly to Low Poly Baking Okay. So, uh we're going to make some plates, but this will also give us an opportunity to learn a little bit here. Uh if we want to um bake from a high poly object to a low poly object. So the things to remember um we're going to start with low poly object. Um and this the low poly one must be UV unwrapped. And so you're sort of committed to all the usual UV unwrapping stuff here. We wanted to take have really good tixel density, not have overlapping, all that kind of thing. Uh, and then we're going to have a high poly. And this one does not need to be unwrapped. This is the one where you can sculpt detail that then will get baked into the normal map. So let me the the other thing to keep in mind here is that the general what we'll say like the silhouette of these objects should be very similar if not identical, right?

Uh if we want to um bake from a high poly object to a low poly object. So the things to remember um we're going to start with low poly object. Um and this the low poly one must be UV unwrapped. And so you're sort of committed to all the usual UV unwrapping stuff here. We wanted to take have really good tixel density, not have overlapping, all that kind of thing. Uh, and then we're going to have a high poly. And this one does not need to be unwrapped. This is the one where you can sculpt detail that then will get baked into the normal map. So let me the the other thing to keep in mind here is that the general what we'll say like the silhouette of these objects should be very similar if not identical, right?

Right. If we were to look at it right now, it should be the same as the other one. There we go. Um, and let's go to sculpt mode. There's two ways to go about this. Um, if you press R, it gives you this grid where you can sort of go up and down. So this is like the density that'll be uh created when we start to sculpt on the object. Uh and so I'm going to put it like at 0.1 or something right now. That hasn't done anything. That just sort of sets it. And then controlr actually does it. And so now um if you looked at the actual density like here you see that now this is super you know this is it's good that you understand that this is good for sculpt bad for everything else right this is you know UV unwrapping animating efficiency not good right there's just too much density there. And so, um, but we want this because the sculpt brushes are not magic. They're still kind of doing the same stuff that the other modeling tools are. They're just move they're like different tools for moving around um points, edges, and polies. So, if we come back over here like this, uh, yeah. So, in sculpt mode, let's just keep it simple for now just to explain how this works. So, um, I'm going to round out some of the corners. F makes the brush bigger or smaller. Um, and then no matter what brush you're in, you hold down shift, it turns it into the smooth brush because you use the smooth brush a lot. And so, just sort of smoothing out some of the weirdness there from the conversion process along the edges. And I'm going to use a different I'm going to go to this view and then use the ZBrush look. And uh so I have that here. So now I can make some small changes knowing that I'm not going to uh change the um pattern too much. So, let me just come in here to uh go crease polish is a brush I like. I'm going to bring this one down and I'm going to um anytime you this each brush has its own innate direction. Some of them will push in by default while others will pull out and the control button inverts that. So it just depends which brush is which. And so I can for instance um sculpt some kind of pattern here. Actually let's make this symmetrical. Something like we'll do later. So, I'm going to turn on symmetry on the Let's see here. Let's turn on Y symmetry. There we go. And so the crease brush, the crease polish brush, it's kind of like um the default settings on it I think are pretty forgiving in that they as you kind of go over things sort accents them in a way I find fairly easy to work with. But I'm just sort of creating some sort of filigreeish pattern in here. Like so. Again, what I'm not doing is grabbing the snake hook brush um and then doing something like this. Yeah. Or like this. Right. This we've substantially changed the um silhouette of the object and that's not going to be something that's going to work when it bakes back. And so there's that. Um over here for instance, let's put some like noisy detail on this. And so I'll come back and use the totally standard draw brush which you know builds things up or if you press control pushes in. But in addition to just regular soft like the same kind of stuff is available. And so here under texture we can say uh new and in our settings over Here. Let's click there. Yeah. So, this is the texture settings. Um, and we want to make something new. I'm going to grab a noise. There we go. That's what I was looking for up here under type. Um, let's go back up. And now you can see what this is doing. instead of just the usual soft brush, you know, we have something more akin to what's happening in Substance Painter. You can see there's a little bit of change there, but that's, you know, sort of at the border of what would be usable. And if I press control, it does the opposite thing, right? Pushes it in like so. We've got enough there to work with. Um, you can change all the noise parameters here. So this is the musgrave. Okay. And so now um I want to be able to paint on this object in substance painter. Okay. So I am going to first of all save this uh here. And now um we need to export these as separate objects, right? So we're going to have one FBX for this one and another FBX for that one. Um, over here I'm going to go back to object mode and alt G this so it's also at the same place like so. There's minimal difference between the silhouettes of the two there.

The magic here is that you can bake the mesh maps from a different mesh. and then uh bake that data into the mesh maps. So the data is no longer part of a mesh but part of a map. And so we'll say new. And what are we going to import? We're going to import the low. Don't unwrap again. There we go. There's our boring cube and all its boringness. And under texture set settings here, this is where we can do this transfer. And so we go to bake mesh maps. We open up the uh window and we get to use something I haven't used before here. High poly, right? And so here is where you can bring it in. You can look here. And here's the high poly cube. And yeah, it's pretty obvious. One of them is high poly and one of them is low poly. It's like orders of magnitude larger. And bring that in. And we get this. And so the blue is where it's pushed in slightly. The red is where it's sticking out. Um, this frontal distance here allows us to sort of like expand out so that if this is is not covered up by the cage here, then it won't be it won't look that great when it gets baked. Um, and let's just do that much for now. And so we will bake this out. I think we're going to have some gaps on the other side. Let's look. And so our rear distance, I think that needs to come up as well. So I see that hole right there. And so we run it again. That's better. Um, and so let's return to painting. Let's see what we got. So our um you know texture size here matches quite a bit. This kind of got separated out. It has enough space there. We'll come back and see. But you can see what's happening over here. Right?

And yeah, more detail here, especially if you know, you give it more detail uh to work with. and uh you know this is in the mesh maps and so it's in the data that gets read by all of the smart stuff. So for instance, if we did our typical smart test here with the uh um metal, you see that it uses all of the data. And if I come in here and look at the mask for one of these If it's reading the uh curvature can bring all that in and out over there. And then when this gets exported back, right, um all that detail is in there, right? So, um yeah, the a lot of the detail that you can include here is the kind of detail that you can also create, you know, doing heightmap stuff in Substance Painter.

And in this case, I think I might scale the high poly plate out um just a bit to make sure the edges line up pretty well. And you know, one of the ways to sculpt on it would be to do the R and controlR or you can just subdivide the normal way. Uh just telling it to subdivide over and over again. And so let's do it. We'll do it that way this time. Um we'll come into here and I'm going to turn off the low poly plate for now. I'm going to rightclick and convert to mesh. Then tab in and right click and just subdivide this right about there. And then let's look at this over in sculpt view. and um go to sculpt mode. Um smooth this out a little bit on the bottom as well. And then Let's make it. We can do radial stuff here, which makes sense for the plate. Um, so on the I like seeing the grid here. I'm just going to get the here. Let's get rid of this texture for now and see if we can get this radial setup. And so we're going to want radial on the Z, I believe. So let's say one over here. Let's say nine. There we go. And so nine. Um, you know, or pick some other interesting number. And so here on the top we could create our own pattern. And I'm going to come back to that crease crease polish. Sort of sharpen these up a little bit. And let's try this to make some tiny dots. Oops. Not like that. Cool. All right. So, a bunch of detail there. Um, great. That's working. Um, let's go ahead and save this. But let's come back. And the one thing I forgot to do is make sure that our low poly was unl unwrapped. Well, and so let's just come back to UV and take care of that real quick. It should be pretty simple to unwrap this object. I think I'm not going to put the seam at the edge here. I want to go past. And so I think I put the seam down here. And so in this case, alt click around here and say mark seam and then select everything and uh you unwrap and that gives me that. So this is a instance where you know probably the top of the plate is going to be way more important than the bottom plate. And so maybe doing a little bit of my own packing here. So control L and bring this down. G bring it over. And yeah, because they're circles, you're only going to get so much here. You know, this is I think I mentioned this last time. This is a whole, you know, like branch of mathematics circle packing uh to try and maximize the amount of stuff within a certain space. Uh, let me make sure I got the right parts now that I think about it. Ctrl L. Yeah, that's the top part. And then this is the bottom part. Yeah. Okay, good. Uh, so that's unwrapped now.",
    "transcript_segment": "Here we go. And in this case, I think I might scale the high poly plate out um just a bit to make sure the edges line up pretty well. And you know, one of the ways to sculpt on it would be to do the R and controlR or you can just subdivide the normal way. Uh just telling it to subdivide over and over again. And so let's do it. We'll do it that way this time. Um we'll come into here and I'm going to turn off the low poly plate for now. I'm going to rightclick and convert to mesh. Then tab in and right click and just subdivide this right about there. And then let's look at this over in sculpt view. and um go to sculpt mode. Um smooth this out a little bit on the bottom as well. And then Let's make it. We can do radial stuff here, which makes sense for the plate. Um, so on the I like seeing the grid here. I'm just going to get the here. Let's get rid of this texture for now and see if we can get this radial setup. And so we're going to want radial on the Z, I believe. So let's say one over here. Let's say nine. There we go. And so nine. Um, you know, or pick some other interesting number. And so here on the top we could create our own pattern. And I'm going to come back to that crease crease polish. Sort of sharpen these up a little bit. And let's try this to make some tiny dots. Oops. Not like that. Cool. All right. So, a bunch of detail there. Um, great. That's working. Um, let's go ahead and save this. But let's come back. And the one thing I forgot to do is make sure that our low poly was unl unwrapped. Well, and so let's just come back to UV and take care of that real quick. It should be pretty simple to unwrap this object. I think I'm not going to put the seam at the edge here. I want to go past.

There's a lot of like when you do some of the more advanced techniques, there's a lot of like, you know, setting the thing on fire, throwing a bunch of like stuff at it, pouring some things on, and then putting it in a kiln and coming back three days later, and you you're like, \"All right, what happened?\" >> Uhhuh.

Um, >> yeah, I know. I know. I' I've had cats. Yeah. The idea it it is laughable that you would compel a cat to do anything. Uh, yeah. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Like the We're more of a dog household. We've had a few cats in the past, but like Yeah. It's not It's not the same. at all even remotely. Um, all right. So, let's put some some sort of ceramic base in here. So, clearly you want like some uh you know like good starting point here with some sort of granular texture in it. something like this. And I think this is going to be one of those cases where we probably want to use um a single noise and then drive a bunch of channels with that. And so it might make a good case to do this on a separate um you know mask here. And so we'll put this on the fill here. Take this one. And then of course we will make a anchor point for that. And so this is going to be my noise anchor. And then another fill on top of that. And we'll read a lot of this data up here. For instance, um let's start in the color part of it. And then definitely grab a gradient. And this might be one of those issues where I could do one of these things. There we go. Sort of sample some colors there. That starts to give me a little bit of what I want. And of course, you can move some of these to make it a little bit more. In fact, I might even go four here. Puts at the end. Uh well, here. Yeah, let's make something darker and figure out where that could go. Just a little bit of that. There we go. And that works. Okay. And then let's read that in the this is our ceramics. Uh read this in the um other channels. So roughness certainly. Let's grab the same anchor point data and um yeah, I'm going to add a levels here to the roughness. And yeah, let's move our output up towards shinier. There we go. That's giving me some specular action now when I'm moving it around. Um, kind of want don't want to smush it, I think, on either side. So, about like that. Like that's looking more ceramicy. Has some texture to it. Um and uh yeah, no metallic here. Let's raise this metal here. And so in this channel height, sort of separate this a little bit more. Kind of gives us a little bit of a lip there. um in the thing. Yeah, might be room for a blur there. So again the there's the this is the one as I saying this like I point out the one thing that you can't do in nodes and that's blur. Uh there's no blur node because doing that kind of calculation on the GPU is not um straightforward. So, anytime you're look in looking for a blur node, you're like, where is it? Um, there's usually not a blur node. Can back to here. Um, maybe there's a little bit of height information. Maybe I drive a separate noise on that one. Uh, just to give it some variety. It looks good. Okay. And of course, dial that in. Oops. Not there. There we go. Like that. Yeah. And I feel like there's more work to be done on the metal part, but you get the idea.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: Open World Layout >> Laid out my area as I have it in game. you know, that's going to be an open world. Um, it's is on a terrain, but that terrain is about 15 times bigger than the one that I have. >> Yeah. So, that cube there, you can just turn that off or delete it. Like, I just had that there so that you knew which way the capsule was facing when it's just a capsule. So, >> mine's roughly a little bit bigger than this. Maybe it's a maybe it's a good size bigger. Um, but you'll be starting off in this area um in a home and then the yellow blocks represent mountains or hills um that you can traverse. Um so you'll be able to walk up the mountains um and see I'm still thinking that's a ground detection, which is one of my questions. U but yeah, I laid it out pretty much how it's going to be in my world. Um there's going to be another home you can come into and interact with. Um more like hills and environment. There's going to be trees and stuff. So, but that's for the game. No spoilers. Um, so my first question is that slow bounce, like you saw him bouncing on top, but when he's on the slope, he was fine standing, but when you run backwards, he kind of has that bounce animation, and I'm not sure how to fix that. I did look it up, but they said you have to mess with the scripts, and I'm not doing that. Um, but maybe that's just a ground check because I saw >> I mean, that's a good intuition right at this point. Like, don't without some more guidance there. Don't don't go in and start typing stuff. Yes. >> Okay, we'll look at it >> on top of the box. Um and then another which I mentioned in my um logic is enemy movement. If it's if I have to do enemy movements like the pattern that they walk around, if that's going to be done in Unity or if I do that in Blender and then transfer because my enemies do have a movement, but I just don't know how to make them move around the map like on >> Yeah. So yeah, we'll talk about that here in a second when we're done, but the same rule applies, right? Sort of what we'll call transform movement, like going from A to B almost always in Unity and character movement in Blender. So I'm I'm thinking that might be animation. And then um can you have I'm pretty sure it's in the scripts. um when you deal damage um like how you shot the projectile, can you have the projectile take off a certain amount of health? Um so like each attack like does different damage like one's more powerful than the other or less powerful than the other. Um I'm pretty sure that's in the scripts. Um and then I asked this in Discord, but it got buried uh with everything else. Can we move just the animations from Blender like this one? Um because I think it's kind of tedious that you have to export everything just for the one. Um and I'm not sure if you can just export the the animation and then bring that into Unity and then apply it. Uh because I did fix um the run animation. Um it's not in here yet. I haven't moved it over, but I did fix it so he's not so cartoony and his ankle does kind of bend out, you know, when he takes his uh stride. Um but yeah, that was my question. Another question is um can we just move the animations instead of moving all of everything? But I'm not sure. I haven't tried if you're in general if you it should work and it works on a mass scale if you turn on your tools. So for something like that um yeah exporting the entire blend file. This is the underlying thing is that um close unity replace file with same name file and so that's two steps one delete the existing one in Unity project and then um replace with same name. Um that should propagate up through the system. Just don't do it when Unity is open. Yes, >> I do it when >> it's fine. >> I don't delete. I just like save over. >> Okay. So, just say you're saving directly to the Unity directory. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. it'll >> it just updates through the system. >> Okay. So, if you save directly from Blender to the Unity uh directory, you can save yourself some steps there. >> Exporting from there. So, that goes back up through and then all of the references stay the same. So like the use of that animation clip in the um animator would be the same because remember only the it's only reading the you know the mesh is only coming over is only being referenced in that initial game object. The other ones that we're bringing in the only thing that's being referenced is the essentially rotation information for the other animations for the go for the bones. The only thing that you would need to do to make adjustments is that if you that comes to mind is if you change the length of the animation, like if you made it shorter or longer, you might need to compensate for that in some of the animator settings. So yeah, if you're saving directly to the Unity file, Unity project directory, that works. Otherwise, you can close it, replace, and then come back in. The other thing to know about here is that if this show if at any point you get some problems here where you know like it seems it's not if for instance if you're replacing a script and it seems like it can't find the script. The big thing you can do here everyone should write this down is reimpport all. And so this command in the assets will take a minute as it looks through the entire project and sort of reprocesses the stuff uh that's there. Okay, so this is definitely important for scripts. And so that is here if you were to right click. And then there's I can't zoom in on this for some reason. Why can I not zoom in it? Okay, for whatever reason I can't when this is right. So there's reimpport and that's for just one file and then there's reimpport all which will just sort of look at the whole thing. you know, it'll chug for a little while while it does that, but that should help reestablish connections if the connections have been severed. Okay. Yeah. So, we'll look at the slope thing. The enemy thing we'll talk about as soon as we're done here, but the um and then we'll get to the the slope thing. But this is looking really great.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: Parkour Level Design So, I mean, were you saying that these are not structures like they're going to be little hills? Is that what you guys understood? What he was saying? Okay. I mean then yeah then at this point go ahead and do that here right like that's that's you can take the the gray boxing can include you know like terrain development here like go ahead and make the terrain that has the hills where they need to be like this is going to be some sort of structure there but um yeah go ahead and sculpt the terrain with the basic layout of what it is you want to have there in terms of hills. Okay, cool. Let's see. Is make sure I have the chat open. Okay, it's just Lily right this morning so far. Not sure if B's on there. >> All right, the gray boxing of my level design. Um, I'm just trying to get something in. So, I still just do need to work on I didn't get to get my character in, but I did complete the level design. So, oh, I'm sorry. I need to move the player over. So, you have like the level. Um, right now it is just the cube just because or it is just it's just or the cylinder just cuz I need to get my player in here, but I need to get something in. Um, I'm in multiple areas where there's like different harder jumps you have to make. And um, some of them are not perfect because once I like the jump power and different stuff like that, but I wanted areas where it was like more of difficult to make it through areas, you know, like I can't make it up there, but as you can see over here, there is a little parkour course. Um, and then like things like on top of a little thing, there'll be an item to collect to trigger something. um items to collect appear, different things to do that and then different things in some areas that are like missed. I want areas that have like misdirection where like looks like something you should go but then ends up taking you the wrong way or doing something like that. Um there will be more expansion probably. I'm not sure exactly what to do with this whole area over here. Um okay, so everybody I just threw that stuff in there so you had stuff to work with this. I'm not saying you your level needs to be this random plane and then a massive terrain next to it. Like make it the space you want in the game. Okay? Like like do you know lay out exact you know a rough draft of what it is you want the space to be here. Um, so if there's not going to be terrain, just delete the terrain and then uh, you know, the, you know, in in all instances, don't accept the defaults, right? Like I just tried to put some stuff in there so that you had something to start with with which to remake the world as you see fit there, right? Like starting with like how big does this place need to be? um like don't just take the arbitrary size of the plane I made to just sort of put some things in there to get you know so you would have something to get started with right so yeah it make I think it helps to do this kind of thinking away from the computer right because I I gave you this stuff here because setting all this up with a totally blank Unity scene is not it's can be timeconuming right and there's like lots of places where that can go wrong. And so I just tried to fast forward a little bit for you there. But it's your job is not to put the stuff in the scene, you know, in terms of importing it. Like that's there to get started. Your job is to artistically envision the space. Yes. >> Yeah. I have to like pace around my room for an hour. >> Yeah. I can't >> I can't stress this enough. I can count on no fingers the amount of good ideas I've had using a computer. None. It doesn't. The tool as it's currently designed does not foster a physiological state for quality creativity. Every idea I have comes usually for me it's walking or running. Running I have I have no less than a hundred voice memos on my phone from the what at the time seemed brilliant and some are good and some are maybe not. Uh ideas that I had while running and so the uh I have like I said zero voice memos from when I was using the computer to implement those ideas. It is a tool for implementation right? So think about what you want it to look like, then come in and use the computer for what it's best at. Just manifesting that vision, not ideulating. >> But I do want to expand on it a little bit. Um, and I want to >> like again, I'll equally get on everybody about this, but like that random sphere that I put there, why is it in everybody's gray box, right? Like it's is that really what you wanted, right? Like is this I have a funny a really funny story a friend told me once about, you know, their bathroom remodel that really went off the rails and then at the end they're like, \"Is this really the bathroom we wanted?\" And you know, like you have to ask yourself the same thing about this game environment. Like is this really is this really the game environment I wanted? >> Make more like secret areas and something that could be really cool. And then for my board um design things, I did a a dialogue for like a collector item. So enter zones active collect item start dialogue. Um for like a secret door trigger because I want to add a secret door. Yeah. Enters trigger zone on trigger enter. It starts the animation of the door open. Um collect item player collect item. Play the this dialogue and then the secret door. Like if these were all connected, just excuse me, something I was thinking of, the player would collect like the final item or maybe in this case one of the items and then this would activate this one which would then activate this one and then it would update like a collector and then um I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do it and I'm not sure 100% how it would work, but something that would be cool is like a respawn. So that way I can make like if like I said misdirection player goes in a wrong direction they fall down a trench or some kind of pit and then they the player does fails and they enter a sugar zone which then would activate the player to somehow go back to the starting zone. So I think that that could be something that's pretty cool. Um sorry about my voice. My voice is like dying right now. But yeah, so I think that's pretty cool. But I'm happy with it so far with like um the gray boxing so far and I'm excited to do more um of building my level. >> Okay, good. Again, um >> that's good plan there. Um yeah, we have something like this in the examples. The um a lot of students want to do secret stuff in the games. um give your player a chance to discover it, right? If you want to have some like truly weird, undiscoverable Easter eggs, that's fine. But like I would really save those for the end of the development process once you've sort of tick the box on like the main part of the game as opposed to like some stuff that someone may or may not ever find, right? Um yeah, like how secret is it, right? Is it totally random or is there any clues as to what would what would what would there right I think it's much more interesting when there's actually some way that you could discern things are happening. Uh cool okay that's good. I just want you to be more intentional with the space. Again if you're not going to use that terrain delete the terrain. Here's Gavin.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: City Environment Design >> Hi everybody. So this week, um, I started I really started, uh, creating the environment for Mr. Peppermint for the city. Um, first off, I had to actually had to spend a lot of time kind of redoing a lot of Mr. Peppermint. I had to redo I had to apply the scale and then I scaled I actually scaled them down in Blender. Um, and then I had to apply scale and I had to kind of fix some of the animations because they got messed up because of that. And then I had to bring them all into Unity again and set that up. But, uh, I did it in the end. Um, and now he's working properly. He's got his textures on. He's looking nice. And, uh, yeah, here's the city basically. It's not nearly like I I mean, I'm almost done roughing it out. I'm not even finished necessarily roughing it out. >> Yeah. Really great, right? I mean, this does not look like my default file, right? This feels like its own space, which is great. >> And yeah, where's the sphere? No spears here. >> And yeah, I think you did a really good job of uh communicating uh the scale in a way that works with the size of the the scale of the character, right? It feels like like appropriately stylizedish kind of city. >> Um I've got a much better idea though of how I mean creating the city actually made me think about what the story is of this and uh so it was good. I spent like an hour actually ironing out what that story is, how things how things are meant to progress. Uh, and I actually I have a good idea of how I want it to work. And, uh, if you have any ideas because there is this area here. I'm still thinking of something to go here. Uh, if you have any ideas, feel free to tell me. Uh, probably won't I don't know. I If it's a good idea, I I'll I'll use it. I'll use it. Uh, and yeah, this is supposed to be like a city. It's near like a river or something here >> because there's a large body of water down here. Um, and there's like a bridge >> to like I tried to think of ways to kind of limit you from obviously leaving the small area. So, I had like a bridge that's up so you can't get across. Little gates like fences across different things which are going to represent different things. Yeah, that's that. Um, here I just quickly play from his view. I think it looks pretty good from It's kind of hard to do the scaling of everything to match to not look too big or small from Mr. Peppermint's view. Um, this is your apartment building you're going to come out of near the beginning of the game. And yeah, I'm happy with it. Liking how it's all looking. And uh, I will show this is the flowchart. I don't know how accurate some of these are to be honest because I figure a lot of them I'm just gonna kind of figure out as I'm doing it. Collect key because you're gonna need a key at one point. You will the key will be a mesh like an object. You will enter the trigger zone basically the collider or whatever of it. The game collection manager will go up by one since you got the key and it let it then you can use that key for other things and then set active pool. The key will disappear from the actual environment. uh when you're going up close to someone to talk to them. Text on screen, you know, enter your trigger zone action display text dialogue. I just copied this from because I'm going to use this. I copied this from when you did it in class. >> Yeah. So, most of the time you're talking to someone using the the action display text probably not for dialogue situations, just for like, you know, like alerts or player messages, things like that, right? Anytime it's going to be some sort of extended dialogue sequence, it makes sense to use the dialogue um thing. sound from stomach bounce. It'll it'll make sense, I promise. Uh when you jump, this is basically just a bumper, just how bumper works. And then I'm also gonna have like an audio source play when you the sound. Yeah, sound playing from the stomach bound. And then I'm going to have like a respawn system. So if you like jump off into that water portion on the side uh that trigger zone of near the water, you will respawn back at a specific point that I choose and action display text as well saying that Mr. Peppermint can't swim. Um and yeah, I guess that's uh that's it. Okay. So, something to continue there or con consider from a gameplay standpoint is like you also just have like invisible barriers there that just like don't let you fall in the water. You know, >> I want you to be able >> you want you to be able to fall in >> experience at least once. >> Okay. So, we probably need two categorically different things like hard restart and soft respawn. That's going to require a little bit of a different just a slight change, but that's I think is doable. Okay, that looks really great like that you know you have visualized the world in a way uh that I think is going to work there and then in terms of uh your situation in particular thinking about the buildings and how could you model four or five different building parts that then you could put together in Unity in a way to make it seem like several different buildings, right? Like more different buildings, right? So, some sort of, you know, yeah, think of it like Legos in that sense, right? Where how could I leverage, you know, five or six different walls, you know, and maybe a couple different roofs or whatever to make this u to be able to populate the entire city versus like a whole city full of bespoke buildings, right? like that's not we don't have the time for that, right? Um >> like I want the game to start in his apartment >> and then you go out the door. >> Is there a way to like teleport or like a cut scene between like leaving instead of you having to actually just walk through the entire building to leave kind of teleport between rooms? I mean, I think we could load the other room as a separate scene so that you're sort of like in that building and then then you're out because I think Adrian was talking about that as well. Okay. But great, good, really good, Landon.",
    "transcript_segment": ">> Hi everybody. So this week, um, I started I really started, uh, creating the environment for Mr. Peppermint for the city. Um, first off, I had to actually had to spend a lot of time kind of redoing a lot of Mr. Peppermint. I had to redo I had to apply the scale and then I scaled I actually scaled them down in Blender. Um, and then I had to apply scale and I had to kind of fix some of the animations because they got messed up because of that. And then I had to bring them all into Unity again and set that up. But, uh, I did it in the end. Um, and now he's working properly. He's got his textures on. He's looking nice. And, uh, yeah, here's the city basically. It's not nearly like I I mean, I'm almost done roughing it out. I'm not even finished necessarily roughing it out. >> Yeah. Really great, right? I mean, this does not look like my default file, right? This feels like its own space, which is great. >> And yeah, where's the sphere? No spears here. >> And yeah, I think you did a really good job of uh communicating uh the scale in a way that works with the size of the the scale of the character, right? It feels like like appropriately stylizedish kind of city. >> Um I've got a much better idea though of how I mean creating the city actually made me think about what the story is of this and uh so it was good. I spent like an hour actually ironing out what that story is, how things how things are meant to progress. Uh, and I actually I have a good idea of how I want it to work. And, uh, if you have any ideas because there is this area here. I'm still thinking of something to go here. Uh, if you have any ideas, feel free to tell me. Uh, probably won't I don't know. I If it's a good idea, I I'll I'll use it. I'll use it. Uh, and yeah, this is supposed to be like a city. It's near like a river or something here >> because there's a large body of water down here. Um, and there's like a bridge >> to like I tried to think of ways to kind of limit you from obviously leaving the small area. So, I had like a bridge that's up so you can't get across. Little gates like fences across different things which are going to represent different things. Yeah, that's that. Um, here I just quickly play from his view. I think it looks pretty good from It's kind of hard to do the scaling of everything to match to not look too big or small from Mr. Peppermint's view. Um, this is your apartment building you're going to come out of near the beginning of the game. And yeah, I'm happy with it. Liking how it's all looking. And uh, I will show this is the flowchart. I don't know how accurate some of these are to be honest because I figure a lot of them I'm just gonna kind of figure out as I'm doing it. Collect key because you're gonna need a key at one point. You will the key will be a mesh like an object. You will enter the trigger zone basically the collider or whatever of it. The game collection manager will go up by one since you got the key and it let it then you can use that key for other things and then set active pool. The key will disappear from the actual environment. uh when you're going up close to someone to talk to them. Text on screen, you know, enter your trigger zone action display text dialogue. I just copied this from because I'm going to use this. I copied this from when you did it in class. >> Yeah. So, most of the time you're talking to someone using the the action display text probably not for dialogue situations, just for like, you know, like alerts or player messages, things like that, right? Anytime it's going to be some sort of extended dialogue sequence, it makes sense to use the dialogue um thing. sound from stomach bounce. It'll it'll make sense, I promise. Uh when you jump, this is basically just a bumper, just how bumper works. And then I'm also gonna have like an audio source play when you the sound. Yeah, sound playing from the stomach bound. And then I'm going to have like a respawn system. So if you like jump off into that water portion on the side uh that trigger zone of near the water, you will respawn back at a specific point that I choose and action display text as well saying that Mr. Peppermint can't swim. Um and yeah, I guess that's uh that's it. Okay. So, something to continue there or con consider from a gameplay standpoint is like you also just have like invisible barriers there that just like don't let you fall in the water. You know, >> I want you to be able >> you want you to be able to fall in >> experience at least once. >> Okay. So, we probably need two categorically different things like hard restart and soft respawn. That's going to require a little bit of a different just a slight change, but that's I think is doable.

Of course, again, unfortunately, I'm still a week behind. I got to make progress on last week's animations. I was hoping to at least have like I do have the idle animation, the run animation done. I was hoping to at least have the jump one done too, but sadly not yet at this time. So, but I'm working on that. Shouldn't take too long. Then, yeah, I'll just show you my progress where I'm at today. It's 7:30. I should turn in something for each deadline. So, I'll show my animations, my run animation. Okay, that's good. The main thing that's missing is just some sort of up and down here. like the h the the main hip controller, you want to have some kind of up and down probably up. Uh yeah, because this is the leg coming forward. This is the other leg. Yeah. So up, down, up, down. Somewhere in that neighborhood. But the arm and leg I think the arm and leg stuff looks right. Let me play it again. Yeah, you got the opposite ones forward. >> Yeah. So, the hips going up and down. and then go back and look at the initial animation lecture, you've got the correct waves, but then we talked about shifting those waves left and right. Um, once we have make cyclic on so that for instance, it's not like the arm and leg are perfectly in sync. A little bit of difference there starts to give us a sense of causality in the body. You know, like when you're running, your your arms are kind of uh leading your legs there a little bit. And just a few ju just nudging something a few frames makes a big difference there in terms of uh it not feeling, you know, doing any movement where everything would be totally synchronized like it's profoundly difficult to do in real life, right? because you're not the body is not designed to to work that way, right? >> Also, >> saving incremental. That's great. here. >> A very subtle idol animation. >> I know. I know. I'm just kidding. That's good. I I would again the these bones below this uh here you're you're moving that bone, right? Uh if you rotated it, I think that would be uh a little bit more natural because it is it does look like it's kind of like it's obviously coming unconnected there. And then also some kind of bending of the knee makes the legs come alive. But then at least my character I got the jump connect. character moving forward like we said last week don't want I don't want to black hole at the Okay, a couple things. This uh help other students diagnose their problems. If you're seeing this parameter blinking a lot, what might that be a sign of? >> It may cause one, both for you and your character, perhaps. that >> Yeah. Well, the the plane that you're on may not be on the ground layer. >> Yeah. And so everything that you the player you want the player to be able to stand on and then jump from needs to you need to go to up here under layers and add it to the ground layer. G R O U N D. And then the other thing in the character controller, you need to make sure that the ground layer for the charact like what it's looking for is ground is just ground, right? So, here here let's look. There we go. We want this. This is the reason I put this note in here. So, it says this. Okay. ground, not um default and ground, just ground is the way. >> Okay, that's that's part one. Part two is making sure that this is on the ground like so. There. So, the name of it is irrelevant. I probably should have just called it In order to just decrease confusion, we'll just call it floor, but it doesn't matter. It could be called Bob. As long as it's on the ground layer, that means you'll be able to jump on it and from it. Okay. And so if that's what we what you want to see is like that checkbox check, checked staying checked when you're just standing there and then it should uncheck when you are in the air and then check again when you're on the ground. Right? It's just a boolean that's that's telling the computer like is the player on the ground or not. Right. So that's that's the main thing. Yeah. Well, I mean, we talked about this previously. What was horrible about it? >> My character was just dancing in the air. >> Uhhuh. >> And I was like, why is he doing that? >> Uhhuh. >> I fixed it before, but why is he still Why is he doing that again?",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: Desert Racing World >> Did you go back and look at the character controller stuff? >> I fixed it. >> Okay. Yeah. My my advice there would be like if there's some if you're totally not sure about something, I would go back and like there's a reason that we record this stuff. It's it's not so I can get more like and subscribes. It's so that you can go back and look at all this stuff, right? Because I know like unfortunately a lot of this stuff is very clicky. Like you gota have this box clicked and so that's why I try to record all this stuff so that it's there as the history of having things clicked, right? So you're the thing to take away from that is like earlier in your process rather than being frustrated for two days go back and look at the reference right and then at that point once you look at the reference lecture then it's still not making sense then ask something on discord okay all right cool okay uh >> hello Razor navigate through this world. Uh so I went with the terrain. Um here's some gray boxing. Uh this would be like a introduction like pseudo tutorial. So like you're you'll be in a car. Razer likes to go fast. U this I still need to do the car stuff. Um so that's why Razer's speed is insane. So you would get into the You would there would be like a little indicator like like GTA style how like to get to a mission there's that little glowing circle. >> So you get in there >> see GTA 6 got delayed again it activates the dialogue uh tells you hey there's a storm coming then you're on your way. Uh, I wanted this to be a little bit rocky terrain. Um, and then there's another >> I don't know, maybe maybe Razer's a a descendant who has inherited some speed force from the Flash, right? So the um uh another effect I mean I say kind of jokey but like this is probably useful for a lot of people is the you know we know about the particle effect but those of you who have investigated perhaps know about this but there's also a trail effect trail renderer and so uh we just have Just this, right? So, why is it pink? >> No material or texture. >> That's right. There's no material or texture on it yet. But, uh, yeah, you can throw this on any moving object. Um, so, uh, you know, speed trails, trails behind the car. Um, obviously there's a bunch of settings here to, uh, adjust in terms of, you know, the length of the trail and the tapering of the trail and then the material on the trail. The trail is a 2D thing. It's a flat. It's like a particle. It's flat to the camera, right? And so, um, so yeah, that's a super useful one. And um in general super super performant. So I mean I mean unless there's some really strange things happening you can have a bunch of those and not have it be uh a problem. So uh trail renderer specifically for the car there. [Music] >> Over here the like I guess underneath me. Uh that's the the terrain. Uh I went with three squares. Um so this would be theoretically another place either a scavenge place or shop workshop. Uh and then like you have to make a choice to go left or right. Um and I'm kind of thinking this might be the the right speed. Maybe a little bit slower uh in the car. Um my my thinking is uh car battles. If you're fighting with someone in a car, uh you're going to want some distance to actually have that engagement. Um, so I depending on how that works out, um, I might have to like make these even longer, uh, or figure out how to travel less distance but still make it feel really fast, which I feel might be difficult. I mean, this feels fast to meish. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is this is three terrains long. >> Yeah. So, this would be separate sections. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I was just thinking like maybe the you know like the storm progression like halts for or like slows down during the car battle part and then you know like something like that. But I mean yeah the the scale of it seems good. I mean is this along the lines of what you're thinking in terms of like the you know it feels like a canyon you know feels like Fury Road to me. So um yeah he's I mean setting up the space here feels great. Um, and once it's a car, I think we're we're in in business there. >> Um, so, uh, yeah. So, the the layout, um, with the three squares, I went with, um, what kind of like inspired me from the start, uh, I I don't know how to, uh, smooth. I started with a hard brush at first. Um, but I don't I couldn't figure out how to smooth. >> Isn't there a smooth thing? I thought there was a smooth thing. Um but like in FTL uh you have these sectors the sector map. So like it does branching paths and stuff and like the idea I had is that like one over here like maybe there's like a little indicator uh saying hey this is a hostile area you're going to be attacked by cars or hey there might be schedulable places or there's a workshop here. So then you have to make those choices which I think is like very common in rogue likes. Uh like Hades has it, FTL has it, uh Slay the Spire has it. So just like incorporate that into the design um is what kind of my idea with that. I mean rogue like like not actually rogue like right in terms of like it it's the same each time but you just have you have some decision to make here in the game. Okay. [Music] >> Right. >> And then for my >> uh yeah so I mean the the ideas that came to mind like what if they're you like road signs but chances are you might blow past those and not really see them. And so something that's probably a little bit more UIish there popping up where you know you hit this trigger zone and we get some a message about like left is vandals right is whatevers you know kind of thing. Um, but then I think that's clear enough here while you're driving, but then here there'd be like three different options. So, I mean, the other idea would be like stuff on the ground. >> Yeah. like the player won't have much time to make the decision, >> right? Yeah. >> Flow charts. Let me open up here. Uh so let's go with the first one. Um so scavenge logic. So player enters the trigger zone like the little GTA uh style thing. Uh display info. Hey, like this is a scavengeable. Uh like it's there's the stuff to sc I guess there there wouldn't be any like trigger like it wouldn't be just flashing if there wasn't anything to scavenge. Uh display info and then if the player stops in there then we animate Razer running jumping out of the car running into the building starts scavenging um and then player cancels the scavenge. Say the storm's getting too close or like a car an enemy car is coming by uh or there's nothing left to scavenge like you've already scavenged like three three items and there's not anymore. Then you animate razor running to the car. Um enemy zone combat logic. A player enters the awareness zone. It's just a little zone of like they're on high alert. Uh they start moving towards the player to like start engagement. But If the player leaves the zone, then the enemy goes back to being passive. However, if the player enters the engagement zone, uh then they the enemy will start attacking the player. And depending on what enemy, this is probably sketch stretch goals for this class. Um but if there's multiple different types of enemies, they'll have different types of zones, different attacks, obviously. Uh workshop logic. Uh so the player enters the trigger zone, display info. Uh same with scavenge. player stops in the zone, opens up a menu, um, and the player could pick an available upgrade. If they have the the right resources, it'll upgrade their car, or they could close out the menu. Either way, a workshop will close. We remove the trigger zone and update workshop model to look closed. Then for the storm logic, we spawn it at the start of the game. It moves in a straight line, slowly increasing velocity. When the player enters the caution zone, there will be like a little zone in front of it. Uh they'll be displaying warning dialogue. Uh like you know like in first person shooters little like blood thing but like make it a little stormy. Um and then if the player enters the storm zone, the player health will decrease over time proportional to the distance they are into the storm. So just a little bit if they're like touching it, but like if they're like deep in it and like they can't see anything, then they're probably taking they're going to die real quick. Play health logic, take damage, display an indicator little like flash like like maybe shake the screen. Uh decrease the health and then if it is less than equal to zero, then play the death animation, then game over. Otherwise, uh give them some invisibility frames just to make it so that they don't like immediately die if the the the bullet or whatever uh like doesn't despawn immediately or whatever or like they're like hitting another car uh just good gameplay. Uh and then heal display an indicator maybe like green and then like a little refreshing thing. I don't I'll figure that out later. Uh and then increase the health but there's no upper limit. Uh so like the car will just like start you just put more and more scrap on it. Um, and like an idea I had is that like you scavenge scrap and you just like put it on your car and it increases your health, but you could use that to upgrade or buy things from the workshop or the the shop. Um, so like your health is the resource. I mean, having a heavier car be a healthier car kind of goes against the laws of physics, but you know, okay, you know, that's not I'm not a car guy, but I you know, I understand that part of it. Cool. This is very well thought out. I mean, in terms of like uh yeah, the storm logic seems uh well thought out. You know, it's a particle effect at its core, but then, you know, something at first glance there's like, you know, three or more zones uh that uh subtract from uh the character. And so that would be the um on trigger stay, right? Because that the trigger zone script does have a stay re-triggering rate that's right in the editor, right? It does not by design evaluate every frame. And so you can choose how often that gets updated, you know, and then that uh would be subtracting health from the health manager. Yeah, very well thought out. I mean the I would put the shop thing later once the storm and enemies are in place. like let's go for that first but yeah this is in the example so we can look at how that is created but the overall layout seems good I mean I would like that seems plenty long for now to get our you know first version of this through the system and so yeah I would move forward with that three length system uh there because it seems like you know certainly your computer wasn't having any problems there and I think that's going to work and it does feel like you know feels like uh I think what you're going after there. So the next step is to download the um particle system examples and you know put a bunch of explosions and fire and dust everywhere. That's the clearly the next step to take. Cool. All right. that you looks like you got well worked out there and like yes, you threw out the defaults and you know manifested the world that feels like a world. So that's great. >> Well, I mean the Monday's lecture of the auto spawner spawning a bunch of stuff rolling down like we're going to have a bunch of rocks fall down off of the terrain,",

[Music] >> Over here the like I guess underneath me. Uh that's the the terrain. Uh I went with three squares. Um so this would be theoretically another place either a scavenge place or shop workshop. Uh and then like you have to make a choice to go left or right. Um and I'm kind of thinking this might be the the right speed. Maybe a little bit slower uh in the car. Um my my thinking is uh car battles. If you're fighting with someone in a car, uh you're going to want some distance to actually have that engagement. Um, so I depending on how that works out, um, I might have to like make these even longer, uh, or figure out how to travel less distance but still make it feel really fast, which I feel might be difficult. I mean, this feels fast to meish. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is this is three terrains long. >> Yeah. So, this would be separate sections. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I was just thinking like maybe the you know like the storm progression like halts for or like slows down during the car battle part and then you know like something like that. But I mean yeah the the scale of it seems good. I mean is this along the lines of what you're thinking in terms of like the you know it feels like a canyon you know feels like Fury Road to me. So um yeah he's I mean setting up the space here feels great. Um, and once it's a car, I think we're we're in in business there. >> Um, so, uh, yeah. So, the the layout, um, with the three squares, I went with, um, what kind of like inspired me from the start, uh, I I don't know how to, uh, smooth. I started with a hard brush at first. Um, but I don't I couldn't figure out how to smooth. >> Isn't there a smooth thing? I thought there was a smooth thing. Um but like in FTL uh you have these sectors the sector map. So like it does branching paths and stuff and like the idea I had is that like one over here like maybe there's like a little indicator uh saying hey this is a hostile area you're going to be attacked by cars or hey there might be schedulable places or there's a workshop here. So then you have to make those choices which I think is like very common in rogue likes. Uh like Hades has it, FTL has it, uh Slay the Spire has it. So just like incorporate that into the design um is what kind of my idea with that. I mean rogue like like not actually rogue like right in terms of like it it's the same each time but you just have you have some decision to make here in the game. Okay. [Music] >> Right. >> And then for my >> uh yeah so I mean the the ideas that came to mind like what if they're you like road signs but chances are you might blow past those and not really see them. And so something that's probably a little bit more UIish there popping up where you know you hit this trigger zone and we get some a message about like left is vandals right is whatevers you know kind of thing. Um, but then I think that's clear enough here while you're driving, but then here there'd be like three different options. So, I mean, the other idea would be like stuff on the ground. >> Yeah. like the player won't have much time to make the decision, >> right? Yeah. >> Flow charts. Let me open up here. Uh so let's go with the first one. Um so scavenge logic. So player enters the trigger zone like the little GTA uh style thing. Uh display info. Hey, like this is a scavengeable. Uh like it's there's the stuff to sc I guess there there wouldn't be any like trigger like it wouldn't be just flashing if there wasn't anything to scavenge. Uh display info and then if the player stops in there then we animate Razer running jumping out of the car running into the building starts scavenging um and then player cancels the scavenge. Say the storm's getting too close or like a car an enemy car is coming by uh or there's nothing left to scavenge like you've already scavenged like three three items and there's not anymore. Then you animate razor running to the car. Um enemy zone combat logic. A player enters the awareness zone. It's just a little zone of like they're on high alert. Uh they start moving towards the player to like start engagement. But If the player leaves the zone, then the enemy goes back to being passive. However, if the player enters the engagement zone, uh then they the enemy will start attacking the player. And depending on what enemy, this is probably sketch stretch goals for this class. Um but if there's multiple different types of enemies, they'll have different types of zones, different attacks, obviously. Uh workshop logic. Uh so the player enters the trigger zone, display info. Uh same with scavenge. player stops in the zone, opens up a menu, um, and the player could pick an available upgrade. If they have the the right resources, it'll upgrade their car, or they could close out the menu. Either way, a workshop will close. We remove the trigger zone and update workshop model to look closed. Then for the storm logic, we spawn it at the start of the game. It moves in a straight line, slowly increasing velocity. When the player enters the caution zone, there will be like a little zone in front of it. Uh they'll be displaying warning dialogue. Uh like you know like in first person shooters little like blood thing but like make it a little stormy. Um and then if the player enters the storm zone, the player health will decrease over time proportional to the distance they are into the storm. So just a little bit if they're like touching it, but like if they're like deep in it and like they can't see anything, then they're probably taking they're going to die real quick. Play health logic, take damage, display an indicator little like flash like like maybe shake the screen. Uh decrease the health and then if it is less than equal to zero, then play the death animation, then game over. Otherwise, uh give them some invisibility frames just to make it so that they don't like immediately die if the the the bullet or whatever uh like doesn't despawn immediately or whatever or like they're like hitting another car uh just good gameplay. Uh and then heal display an indicator maybe like green and then like a little refreshing thing. I don't I'll figure that out later. Uh and then increase the health but there's no upper limit. Uh so like the car will just like start you just put more and more scrap on it. Um, and like an idea I had is that like you scavenge scrap and you just like put it on your car and it increases your health, but you could use that to upgrade or buy things from the workshop or the the shop. Um, so like your health is the resource. I mean, having a heavier car be a healthier car kind of goes against the laws of physics, but you know, okay, you know, that's not I'm not a car guy, but I you know, I understand that part of it. Cool. This is very well thought out. I mean, in terms of like uh yeah, the storm logic seems uh well thought out. You know, it's a particle effect at its core, but then, you know, something at first glance there's like, you know, three or more zones uh that uh subtract from uh the character. And so that would be the um on trigger stay, right? Because that the trigger zone script does have a stay re-triggering rate that's right in the editor, right? It does not by design evaluate every frame. And so you can choose how often that gets updated, you know, and then that uh would be subtracting health from the health manager. Yeah, very well thought out. I mean the I would put the shop thing later once the storm and enemies are in place. like let's go for that first but yeah this is in the example so we can look at how that is created but the overall layout seems good I mean I would like that seems plenty long for now to get our you know first version of this through the system and so yeah I would move forward with that three length system uh there because it seems like you know certainly your computer wasn't having any problems there and I think that's going to work and it does feel like you know feels like uh I think what you're going after there. So the next step is to download the um particle system examples and you know put a bunch of explosions and fire and dust everywhere. That's the clearly the next step to take. Cool. All right. that you looks like you got well worked out there and like yes, you threw out the defaults and you know manifested the world that feels like a world. So that's great. >> Well, I mean the Monday's lecture of the auto spawner spawning a bunch of stuff rolling down like we're going to have a bunch of rocks fall down off of the terrain,"

Like, oh no, there's falling rocks. Like, there's so many falling rocks in video games all the time. Like, if there are this many fall I would be dead by now if there are this many falling rocks in in real life. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's signs all over in the Pacific Northwest as you're driving around up there because of all the, you know, there's like legitimate mudslides and stuff up there, but um yeah, I've yet to to see an instance. the the one year the year the tour to France was delayed the pandem 2020. It was in it was in the late fall almost winter and so like they were dealing with that in the in the race like the race itself got you know very video gamey in terms of like the you know there's like ice on top of some of the mountains they were climbing. It was bananas. This is Maline and this is my progress so far on Margaret. I have the an uh idol animation down. So here's her idol animation in Blender. Uh >> awesome character looks so cool. >> And then I also have her uh walking animation. Uh there's it to the side. I have her hunched over. And I think that's something that I might like looking down is definitely the one of the more important aspects besides being hunched over and kind of having that awkward stance and walk. Okay. So yeah, the artistic cognitive dissonance here in terms of the really happylooking sad flower character is great. Um the I think you the in order just to actually move forward, I think the feet need to you need to have a little bit more bend in the knee there in terms of them just shuffling back and forth um just a touch to to make that work. And then also a big part of being droopy is the up and downness of the thing, right? So, you've got the general body placement there, but the thing you don't have is the, you know, part of what makes it feel heavy is like the the compression and expansion there. And so, um, you're hunched over, but in the hunch, there should also be a little bit more up and down, I think, to make that work. >> Um, I think I might apply that to this one and have her hunched over and looking down a little because she's very, um, she's pretty awkward and she doesn't like really like making eye contact. So, I think that's an important part of her idol character. I after doing the hand thing and the hand crossing over her stomach, I'm not super obsessed with it since she has short arms and she can't really reach her other arm and especially kind of looks a little silly. And um >> yeah, and then everybody I mean this is Bose's case, too. You know, it I would default on the having the legs and feet a little bit into the floor rather than a little bit above. A little bit above looks weird. If they pass in slightly, I think it's most cases unnoticeable, but it, you know, definitely draws attention that because you're floaty there. >> Unity, it looks a lot smoother. I might smooth out that transition back a little bit more. >> Or, >> and again, I talked about this last >> Monday, I think, at length about positioning the character within the capsule of uh the hit capsule, right? And so like the hit capsule is the thing that's the game is using to evaluate where it sits on the ground. And so just by cheating your character down a little bit past that end, the actual visual mesh of the character, the feet will be on the ground. >> I might change up just the idle in general. I'm pretty happy with the walk. I did a walk first because I I don't really see her needing to run that much in this game. Uh the threat is more existential than immediately apparent. Uh let's see. I got that. I got that. I am still working on that jump animation and the assignment that was with this week's assignment. Uh but hopefully I'll get done with that by the end of this week. So I'll be all caught up hopefully. And then uh here's Margaret's face. I'm looking forward to exciting to animating that. Um and then I retextured Margaret. She has new body. I did have to break the pieces apart again and then put them back together because Substance Painter did not want to read the body as a whole. It was only recognizing uh the petals. But I'm really happy with how I retextured everything. I just started from scratch. I gave her a more clayike appearance because I want her to kind of be like made out of clay and do like a kind of a inspired by a stop motion kind of thing. Uh lots of like fabricy textures and stuff. Um, let's see. Uh, there's the head texture. >> Okay, so the the thing you need to check here is this must be the case because there were separate materials on the head, the pedals, and the body. And so just [Music] uh doublech check that. I know in the one that I whether or not if this is the one I I helped you out with then I had combined all of those into one. But if you had put separate materials in Blender, right? The thing that everyone should write down that again when you're working in this workflow is that one blender material equals one texture set in substance painter. This is the ubiquitous because that that the word the phrase texture set I think is uh obtuse when you first start using substance painter but now that you understand the full round tripping right is that you bring your model into substance painter you paint stuff and then what do you output from substance painter you output a set of textures a texture set that go get gets applied to a material. So this should be clearer at this point having gone through the entire life cycle of how this works. So um yeah, as long as I would the first thing I would do for you here is export your what looks like really great painting from Substance Painter uh as a texture set as we did last Whenever I did that, I don't even need to remember now and neither do you because there's the really great um lecture search tool that everyone's using, right? Yeah. I mean, should be super useful and that I've linked to. Yeah. >> Yeah. Um and so export them into Unity. Make sure that that because we we want to get those textures on that character because they look fantastic. And then um the head texture is pretty much the same. I need to clean up the edges a bit. And then uh the pedals, which crash a lot, so we'll see if they crash this time. Um I did bring everything together. I exported it as like PGs and then I brought everything uh together in one kind of thing right here. So hopefully that's something I am able to like compress or something and bring those over uh into Substance Painter. Uh and then also one more thing. >> No, you're bringing them into Unity. So yeah, those are textures. you should be able to bring them in just like we did whatever that was last Wednesday or Monday and create a Unity material to put on your character. So yeah, that looks uh have however you combine them there using Photoshop or something then that they should all go onto one material that goes onto your character. thing to note, I did use this uh add-on called stop mode to give her more of a stop motion um appearance uh in her movements. But I did notice that the I finally finished the videos and I did notice you suggested uh modifying it to look more stop motion in uh Unity, which might fix that kind of jiggling leg issue that she's kind of got. So I I don't know. I'll see what you guys think and I might adjust that uh to do that in Unity instead of Blender. So >> yeah, let me think about that. >> Yeah. If there were just something so the animator would evaluate every so often instead of every frame that that might either be really simple or a total nightmare. So somewhere it doesn't seem like it would be an in between kind of thing. I'll think about that because that would certainly be useful for other people as well to be able to down sample the timing. um the other cuz it didn't look like that was changing in Blender a whole lot. I mean, it looked like you're taking every other frame. Um, actually, yeah, let's just leave it at that because the other way to to do that to the entire skeleton requires that like very um high stakes clicking in Blender uh in >> Yeah, but you need you need to do it to all of the bones. And so, you know, you have to make sure you do that thing where you have all the bones selected but not that very top one because then that allows you to not apply something to the apply a modifier to all the other ones. So, um yeah. Okay. Character looks spectacular. Uh, the only other thing I was going to say is like the center the face part looked waffly. Although I wasn't sure which side was I guess the brown side. Yeah, like perhaps I mean I imagine the center of the sunflowers to be more dotlike and there's some noise textures in Substance Painter that would be perhaps more appropriate there or at least look more like what I imagine the center of the sunflower looking like.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: Horror Game Mechanics just complicate um a lot of this a lot of the flowcharts. So, um and I mean HUD's not that complicated. is just going to have to have um yeah, just some default stuff for like whenever you enter trigger zone, you know, it says the interaction keys you can do like E to interact or something like that. Um and that would just be as simple as yeah, using the canvas and stuff. And then we have like this jump scare event which is more of just like a simple just enter trigger zone and um activate something. So in this case, I have like a particle system for playing steam and then we also play a sound of the steam. And then um I was thinking about how I could implement like a different animation as you walk through the steam. And I don't think this is going to work these these emotes because I think the emotes are only for um like idol animations. Yeah, maybe like I would have separate animations for like a walking while going through steam and it would like change to that. Um like you would enter like a new state kind of I guess. Or alternatively, I think this >> Yeah, we need to be another state. be better is uh just have a button that I could press to like pass through the steam and then he would he would just like play his set um animation and it wouldn't have to deal with the the fact that you could stay in the steam forever. I have I want to be able to either open a door or listen to a door. So like listen to the door before you open it. This is what I have here again. Um just like entering trigger zones and enabling the ability to press the key. And so we'll have just for example the E key to open the door and then G key to listen to the door. So for both these cases you would disable the character controller so you can't move during it. And then um you would play the animations for like either opening the door or listening to the door. And I think for listening to the door I want to have the camera change positions. I guess I should have actually also added um return camera to position after this. But yeah, change the camera to like get close to the door so that you're like with the character like listening as well. And then also, yeah, I want to think about a way to make it so that um you can listen to the door indefinitely and like be able to press G again to stop listening. Not sure how I could do that, but I know it wouldn't be that much more complicated than what's already here. And this is just simply um reading a note. So, yeah, you have a trigger zone around the note. And same thing, if you enter, it allows you to uh press the button keys. you press the key and it displays the image of whatever that you know whatever that uh input trigger zone is set to. Um which will be you know correlated with whatever note it's supposed to be. Um and then that would it would display that image on screen and then I don't know it said that it displays the image for like a set amount of time. I'd rather just have it where it displays it forever and then when you whenever you're done you press a key and it hides it. So, I think doing this like I don't know if you can just set zero for the time it's on screen and that just >> there was a check box for that in the script but I'll look again makes it last forever. I'm not sure. I haven't tried it yet. And then yeah, pressing E and then that just hides the image. So yeah, those are my flowcharts. Um I yeah, I think that makes sense. All right. And then this is my uh gray box environment. So something I noticed and obviously I don't think I'd have the camera uh be like this sort of camera where it's um following behind. You can like rotate like this. I think I want to have like the thing where the camera is like in the corner like this and is like following you as you move and then like kind of switching whenever you get to an area like you know switch over to here once you cross a b a threshold. The biggest thing I had to consider was um how big the rooms need to be because I wanted to feel claustrophobic but also wanted to be able to actually move around. So I ended up like changing the collision a little bit in order to to fit into these tight areas because it didn't work normally. So I don't know if that's a good idea or not. It's probably not. Um, so yeah, I think that's my biggest issue right now is just um rank. >> So what did you do? >> Like the thing you said not to do was like change like the size of the question and stuff >> like that so that >> I mean you didn't get rid of it totally, right? Yeah, >> but like >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> It's not a Mr. Peppermint size collision box. >> No. >> Yeah. Okay. I noticed his box was, you know, Yeah. Not not to throw shade at Mr. Peppermint. >> His box is actually messed up. I need to fix his head just like if you go through like a little tunnel, his head will just phase through it. It's not good. >> Angling the um the collision and stuff. Also could be um the mesh collider. I This is all one one model and I put a mesh collider on it. So it might be getting weird because there's so many so many >> Wait, wait, wait. You put a mesh collider on the character? >> No, no. I'm talking about the >> Oh, okay. different parts here. So, um yeah, I can't enter these right now, but um yeah, and there'll be bulkheads between each of these doors, so you have to open up the door and um yeah, do all that. I think this is like a good size of everything. I do I do like how everything turned out here. I think it could be bigger, but again, I do kind of want like a claustrophobic feel. Yeah, I mean, this all in Blender. I think that's about it. Uh thank you for >> Yeah, that was great. Um, is it all it's not all one mesh in Blender? Right. Right. It's totally the uh episode two meme there >> with Padme. And >> mostly [Music] >> um >> I wasn't planning on like really I kind of like layout. >> You put a mesh collider on it >> and and that wouldn't let you go into some of the rooms. >> That was my assumption. Or is the fact that the collider was too tall or something? I don't know. >> Yeah, let me look at that. The the the layout of the space looks awesome. So Jack's using this backface calling thing where the outside walls are facing in so that the camera can be outside and look in. This is cool. This is almost exactly what I was thinking of like in terms of the beginning of um or part of life. Have you seen Life Aquatic yet? >> Yes. >> Okay. Right. But you haven't seen Life Aquatic. I thought maybe I had one movie that you had watched. Um, so yeah, like the um in Life Aquatic they have these shots where it's a submarine or it's a ship. Um, but it's as if the real life characters are, you know, like these miniatures in this, you know, miniaturish looking ship. If you pull, if you just Google it, you can see that part of it.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Student Feedback: Submarine Layout Design This is what I have so far. I wasn't able to get the flowcharts done or really finish the map or put in most of the like props. Not having a couple problems, only one of which houses. Pretty sure I saw you have that same issue. So, I believe I'll be able to fix that. And also, yeah, just Sarah's doing this. Um, what I think is happening is that the collider that detects whether or not she's touching the ground has decided to act like a collider and is not allowing her to touch the ground. To fix it, I've changed the skin width. >> No, don't touch the skin width. It's not that it's in the character controller script. It is here. I mean also is the ground mark ground? That is my other question. F over here. Look at it in orthographic mode to be able to correctly see this. But the the red sphere. Okay. So I would I would write these down in order to avoid trust uh frustration later. The red sphere is going to be the one that uh is the ground test sphere. And so right here, ground check distance. If I hold down shift and change that, you see that that is changing. And so essentially if this sphere is intersecting the red the red one is intersecting with a collider that is marked ground then you are grounded. Okay. And so if this if you've because there's there's no I've tried to streamline this process as much as possible in my applying my first principle of like how much complexity just enough right uh but people characters are complicated so there's the ground check which is the red one then there's two other ones there's going to be what the capsule collider is and then what the character controller which is also visualized as a as a thing. There we go. There is a separate one. So don't let that get too confused. But if the red one is inside the green one, that means that this one is sort of where we're going to come in contact with the ground. It's going to stop. And so then we won't ever be grounded. Um, and so that and if it's very close, you can definitely end up in situations where it's like flipping back and forth really quickly, which looks like some of what's happening to Zoe here. It's hard to tell. This is not Yeah. So, hold on. Let me see what the defaults are so that you can set those back. I would put them back here. This For the most I I don't think there's any instance where you want to be getting into these settings. Essentially, this script is a manager for that component. And so we've sort of forwarded the controls up to the character controller CC. So I would, as far as I can think right now, I would discourage you from not from adjusting anything here. We want to be here uh in our adjustments. Okay. So I would set those back to whatever the defaults were right there. But also most of the time when people are having these issues, it's the ground thing. >> And I don't know, it doesn't let me start and I don't get it start. I decided at the last minute that it would probably be better if the game was an isometric view. So, I'll rework what I have on the map to put into isometric field and I'll make it so when you go into different areas it'll trigger different cameras and deactivate the previous room and the walls as well as for these rooms probably just like getting rid of most of the rest of the probably depends on how I can get the camera placement to work. >> Okay, the camera switching cameras we discussed that I think that script is fairly solid. Um, and yeah, having an isometric view and having it just shift from room to room I think is the way to go. Um, yeah, that uh I don't think there's a way that that sphere would change color even like it's not it's it's generated in in the script here. It's not a separate game object. So, this I think you may have smooshed this down and our we didn't get to see. Let's see if I could just peer into that. Okay, it still says 0.1, but I'm not seeing the red sphere. So, that's problematic. I don't know. I don't think there's an instance in which it would turn green. >> Oh, when she's in there and it's blinking back and forth, right? I decided at the last minute. >> Yeah. Okay. So, what >> I was noticing that too like counts as a >> change but it still touch it doesn't let me setting on startup and I don't think the skin is important for anything else. >> Okay, we'll check it. There's got to be something. I'll look and see what the deal is there because that is not it hasn't been pushing mine up, but I'm not sure what the deal is there. Okay, one last but not least. Okay, that looks good. But yeah, you got to get through the rest of the layout there for everything and your how because yours is going to be puzzle based. thinking through the puzzles is really great.

And so we've sort of forwarded the controls up to the character controller CC. So I would, as far as I can think right now, I would discourage you from not from adjusting anything here. We want to be here uh in our adjustments. Okay. So I would set those back to whatever the defaults were right there. But also most of the time when people are having these issues, it's the ground thing. >> And I don't know, it doesn't let me start and I don't get it start. I decided at the last minute that it would probably be better if the game was an isometric view. So, I'll rework what I have on the map to put into isometric field and I'll make it so when you go into different areas it'll trigger different cameras and deactivate the previous room and the walls as well as for these rooms probably just like getting rid of most of the rest of the probably depends on how I can get the camera placement to work. >> Okay, the camera switching cameras we discussed that I think that script is fairly solid. Um, and yeah, having an isometric view and having it just shift from room to room I think is the way to go. Um, yeah, that uh I don't think there's a way that that sphere would change color even like it's not it's it's generated in in the script here. It's not a separate game object. So, this I think you may have smooshed this down and our we didn't get to see. Let's see if I could just peer into that. Okay, it still says 0.1, but I'm not seeing the red sphere. So, that's problematic. I don't know. I don't think there's an instance in which it would turn green. >> Oh, when she's in there and it's blinking back and forth, right? I decided at the last minute. >> Yeah. Okay. So, what >> I was noticing that too like counts as a >> change but it still touch it doesn't let me setting on startup and I don't think the skin is important for anything else. >> Okay, we'll check it. There's got to be something. I'll look and see what the deal is there because that is not it hasn't been pushing mine up, but I'm not sure what the deal is there. Okay, one last but not least. Okay, that looks good. But yeah, you got to get through the rest of the layout there for everything and your how because yours is going to be puzzle based. thinking through the puzzles is really great. Where's Where'd he go?"

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Event Game Toolkit Update Process uh like I said, I fixed uh a bunch of bugs yesterday. And let me just um the what I explained before um I was hoping to have everybody use Git to be able to update through the package manager, but it just ended up being too finicky. So, um as we continue to refine things here, most everything is in place, but there'll need to be some changes. So how to update our scripts? Remember the name I've given to this now is event game toolkit EGTK which I'll use that from now on. Um and so the process here would be to number one store your work in your own folder. So, your scene, your materials, your prefabs, you should make your own folder in the project with probably your name on it. And all of the things that you make should go into that folder. This will help not only in updating this but if you bring in any other packages and you need to remove them or you just want to not mix your work with the other work um that makes any sort of transitioning with the project much more difficult. Okay. Uh number two. Number two. Uh before you make any big changes, copy the entire project folder because there when unfortunately I wish it wasn't this way, but it is. This is software development so we don't get there's a lot of instances where we're not going to get a control- Z. Okay. And so you just need to duplicate the folder and then if you're going to make some big structural change, do it in the duplicate and hopefully things go well and you can just move forward and then you know it's a fairly big thing. You can just delete the old old duplicate then if you don't need it. But you have it then in case things go horribly wrong and you're like okay well I need to step back. You're not going to be able to control Z your way out of it. Okay. So, this is different than working with Photoshop or even within Unity because we're moving a bunch of files around here. You don't get the same um insurance policy. And so, okay, number one, number two, and then here, the way we would do it is close Unity, download the update to the EGTK, and then replace the event game toolkit folder. Right. I've kept all of the EGTK in that one folder that says event game toolkit. And so just like uh previously we would do that and I'll do this now as an example. So uh this is that one I was using before. I'm just going to close this and then I'm going to come over here. I hope this doesn't blow up on me. Let's see. Okay. And so here Unity very very quick on the double click. Let me see. I'm going to close this. Right. So this is the this is a project in this instance. Imagine it being your project and we've changed some things and I've told you to update the toolkit. Close project download toolkit. This is the same. Right. So the GitHub link code download zip unlike Blender you need to unzip the zip, right? It's not going to do that. You need to turn it into an actual folder. And so here, how do I get to where this is on my computer? Right click, show and explorer. Here it is. And here's assets. And here's the folder in question that needs to be replaced. And so I am going to dock this window over here. I'm going to make a new window. Here's where I downloaded it. And so there it is right there. This is the new one. Okay. So this definitely you want to be awake and paying attention. Um and so this one gets deleted. Unity is not open, right? Unity hub is not Unity. And then we're just going to simply copy and paste this one over there. And so we'll grab this one. We'll write well we will just simply right click on it and trash it. Then we will come over here not the zip but the actual folder C and then come over here and controlV and there we go it's in there now. Now I can come back to here and proceed. So that's that's our admittedly inelegant but the best we can do for now in terms of uh updating everything at the same time without having to get into individual micromanaging. Uh maybe later some of you may need to do some individual micromanaging where it's just like okay we'll just this one script needs to be replaced. You can apply the same um workflow if you need to replace one individual script. Delete that script, bring in the other one. Right? This is similar to saving over it like Alicia was doing in terms of you know Unity is just looking for the thing the main thing you need to understand looking at everybody in the class and particularly some of the questions on Discord. You can uh only have one version of the script in a in a Unity project. So this is where people run into problems is that they but usually because it's in two separate folders, right? You can't have two files with the same name in the same folder ever. Like you Windows won't let you do that, right? It'll rename the second one to something different. Um, but in Unity, you're going to run into problems in probably an immediate compilation error if you have the same thing. And so that's why we deleted and replaced so that we still maintained only a single version of those scripts in the project. This is the fundamental principle. This is the the whole reason for that workflow. Uh good. And if we look over here,",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Collection System Example okay, the new uh stuff I put together yesterday with our parts in order to look at a bunch of examples. Here were um some example scenes. So I had this like example generator up here. Not great. Um this is a little bit I think easier to gro. Okay. So I think with these three we get at the core of a lot of what's going on. So for instance collection example. Let's open this one and let's look at this. So we've got collectibles and character and items. Okay. And if I hit playip. There we go. I'm collecting them. There we go. I'm also jumping and I can only hope it always gets me with like a weird face rather than like something cool like this. Um so uh the basic collection mechanic here is what you're already familiar with the allow me to point out and what I would be writing down right now is the flow of information in terms of the game management here. So uh let's look at this over here. I've tried to organize these um examples in the way that I would encourage you to also organize the examples in that we've got the managers and the managers are going to sort of manage our game state information. We looked at this slightly on Monday with the health thing and we'll look at another example with that in a second. Um, and the managers are individual. And in almost all cases, I think everybody's going to want to have the UI manager and the state manager. Okay. And so the UI manager, if you click on it, um, is sort of a one-stop shop for most everybody's UI needs. Uh because it's modular, you can have score, health, health bar, timer, and inventory. And you can opt in to these things. Okay? And um where they appear, right? So if I were to turn these on and off, you can see that this other stuff is appearing. This collection game mechanic, right? So like if this is your primary thing in the game collecting things um then you don't need the other stuff right so those boxes remain unchecked and they're okay with not receiving the information over here you can adjust the position of these things um if you look underneath the UI by right here. Game UI manager as a canvas as a child that it's managing and it's sort of managing these these objects underneath. And this is the one that we'd expect for the text. We wanted to change the text font, which you all will need to do so that you're not using the default Unity font. Um, that's there here in the game UI. There's also animation for when it's updated. You saw that that was doing a bounce. And there's also like a scale punch and something else that you can choose from there. and some parameters for this in terms of like also what if they're not items, what if they're um blurbs, right? You would just simply change the prefix here to blurbs and now they are blurbs there. And so then your character could go throughout its world collecting blurbs. One blurb. Two blurbs. Three blurbs. >> Victory. >> Um. Okay. So, I think most of what's here is fairly self-explanatory. How does this get information? Okay. So, the main thing here is that we have prefabs. I've got a couple things here. Um, I'm revising some advice from before. And so, the complicating matter here is events and prefabs. pre we want to we want to use both. Unfortunately, the architecture is such that there is a problematic use of both of these and that's when a prefab has an event configured talking to another object. Okay, meaning not that prefab itself. And so the first principle here to understand is that it is okay to configure a prefab event for only talking to itself. Right? So the event this is most often in the turning myself off where I got hit by this thing and I'm gonna delete myself, right? Um, so >> it's just the game object. It's just the game object. Uh, it you know like you hit restart and it's all there again. So that is okay. What is not okay is a prefab with an event that talks to another object of any kind like either another prefab or another game object. The problem there is that that information is just not stored in the prefab. And so in order to bypass this, you know, like this, this is this is the problem, the solution is to only have spawned prefab. tabs trigger events on themselves. However, we need to get around that. We can get around that by uh using tags to communicate game logic between permanent objects. Objects that will not be created or destroyed over the course of the game. So this is the guiding principle is that in order to not run in in order to you can sort of paint yourself into a corner here in terms of the game logic communication and um as long as you try to make sure that the main stuff that happens in my game are events that are being communicated between permanent objects, objects that persist throughout the game. you're not going to run into the problem where you'll need to reconfigure a bunch of things or the message that needs to be sent is coming from an object that just got deleted, right? That's the the problem here, right? The we want the games to be dynamic to be able to create and destroy objects, but you can't have it rely on messages being sent from objects that get destroyed. So um in this instance um the collectibles here uh are talking to the game mana the collectible manager. So right here collection manager. The collection manager is persistent. It never gets destroyed or created throughout the game. the collection manager. None of the managers have UI except for the UI manager. Okay, so I tried to be consistent there. The UI manager is the thing that puts things on the screen. All the other managers sort of do invisible logic management. And so on the collectibles here, you see that they tell the collection manager to increment, then they delete themselves. Um, I configured one and then duplicated it there because these are just living in the game and they're not going to be dynamically created. And so that works from this instance in the game collection manager over here. There's two um this is just essentially another name for this game collection manager would be counter, right? It's just counting stuff. And um the increment and decrement are you know just fancy words for counting up and counting down. And then we have some sort of threshold. And once that threshold is met um we send out some sort of information uh some sort of change to the game state. Okay. And what else happens here? And every time we count, we send out a message just telling the UI to update the inventory. If you look at the game UI manager here, there's a bunch of, I think, very clearly named functions. Update inventory, uh, update score, update timer. I think hopefully clearly named things, right? depending on what you want to do. The state manager here is kind of a simple thing in that the game has pause, victory, game over, uh, and a restart button. Not everyone's going to need all of these, but they're there. And the important thing to realize is that these are um they should be, as far as I can tell, mutually um exclusive, meaning that the game can only be in one state. You can't be in multiple states at the same time. You either won or you lost or you're playing or you paused. And so, um, here I've got a separate thing for game state UI. If you look at this, this is a canvas. I'll screenshot this. This is the settings we're going to want for all of our canvi or canvases probably is the better word, the actual word. Um, scale with screen size 1920 x 1080. Uh, and in this canvas we have pause. If I were to turn these on, you'll see them all at the same time. There's a pause, there's a victory, there's a restart. Um, the pause is just a message saying that the game is paused. Uh, by by default, that's hardwired to P. That's just hardwired in the game uh state manager. If you want to change that key, you can change it there, but for right now, it's set to P. And so if I hit play and start doing stuff and then hit P it pauses right and so it does two this the script is managing two things when it goes into pause state it shows whatever is in the pause panel and then it also start shows the restart button the restart button everybody's configuration of this should be fairly similar it's just a you know I went to selected the canvas went to UI by and said button and then uh I will style this button to somehow match what I'm doing. And then every button already has an event here, right? And this one talks to the game state manager. And the game state manager has a uh restart scene function. And so if I pause the game, if I play the game and hit pause, I get the restart button and it can restart the game. Or I can There's no way to lose this one. You just sort of keep playing till you win based on this collection here. And then I hit the victory state where it turns on the victory which we could see over here. Right. So, this is enabled now as well as the restart. And so, I could play again there and it starts over. So, these having these, you know, like I'm trying to point out the stuff here, but I think these are really good. Look, some of you are going to use pretty much one model. Some of you are going to use combinations of things. Having this here in what should be a pretty working model uh I think can help in terms of being able to see exactly what's going on with the wiring of the events. The Yeah. So state manager manages the state UI manager manages the UI. I think pretty much everybody is going to have both of those for sure. In terms of the other stuff, other managers, you only want to include the other managers that you're going to need. Okay. So, uh there's that. Let's save. Um let's look",
    "transcript_segment": "okay, the new uh stuff I put together yesterday with our parts in order to look at a bunch of examples. Here were um some example scenes.

And in almost all cases, I think everybody's going to want to have the UI manager and the state manager. Okay. And so the UI manager, if you click on it, um, is sort of a one-stop shop for most everybody's UI needs. Uh because it's modular, you can have score, health, health bar, timer, and inventory. And you can opt in to these things. Okay? And um where they appear, right? So if I were to turn these on and off, you can see that this other stuff is appearing. This collection game mechanic, right? So like if this is your primary thing in the game collecting things um then you don't need the other stuff right so those boxes remain unchecked and they're okay with not receiving the information over here you can adjust the position of these things um if you look underneath the UI by right here. Game UI manager as a canvas as a child that it's managing and it's sort of managing these these objects underneath. And this is the one that we'd expect for the text. We wanted to change the text font, which you all will need to do so that you're not using the default Unity font. Um, that's there here in the game UI. There's also animation for when it's updated. You saw that that was doing a bounce. And there's also like a scale punch and something else that you can choose from there. and some parameters for this in terms of like also what if they're not items, what if they're um blurbs, right? You would just simply change the prefix here to blurbs and now they are blurbs there. And so then your character could go throughout its world collecting blurbs. One blurb. Two blurbs. Three blurbs. >> Victory. >> Um. Okay. So, I think most of what's here is fairly self-explanatory. How does this get information? Okay. So, the main thing here is that we have prefabs. I've got a couple things here. Um, I'm revising some advice from before. And so, the complicating matter here is events and prefabs. pre we want to we want to use both. Unfortunately, the architecture is such that there is a problematic use of both of these and that's when a prefab has an event configured talking to another object. Okay, meaning not that prefab itself. And so the first principle here to understand is that it is okay to configure a prefab event for only talking to itself. Right? So the event this is most often in the turning myself off where I got hit by this thing and I'm gonna delete myself, right? Um, so >> it's just the game object. It's just the game object. Uh, it you know like you hit restart and it's all there again. So that is okay. What is not okay is a prefab with an event that talks to another object of any kind like either another prefab or another game object. The problem there is that that information is just not stored in the prefab. And so in order to bypass this, you know, like this, this is this is the problem, the solution is to only have spawned prefab. tabs trigger events on themselves. However, we need to get around that. We can get around that by uh using tags to communicate game logic between permanent objects. Objects that will not be created or destroyed over the course of the game. So this is the guiding principle is that in order to not run in in order to you can sort of paint yourself into a corner here in terms of the game logic communication and um as long as you try to make sure that the main stuff that happens in my game are events that are being communicated between permanent objects, objects that persist throughout the game. you're not going to run into the problem where you'll need to reconfigure a bunch of things or the message that needs to be sent is coming from an object that just got deleted, right? That's the the problem here, right? The we want the games to be dynamic to be able to create and destroy objects, but you can't have it rely on messages being sent from objects that get destroyed. So um in this instance um the collectibles here uh are talking to the game mana the collectible manager. So right here collection manager. The collection manager is persistent. It never gets destroyed or created throughout the game. the collection manager. None of the managers have UI except for the UI manager. Okay, so I tried to be consistent there. The UI manager is the thing that puts things on the screen. All the other managers sort of do invisible logic management. And so on the collectibles here, you see that they tell the collection manager to increment, then they delete themselves. Um, I configured one and then duplicated it there because these are just living in the game and they're not going to be dynamically created. And so that works from this instance in the game collection manager over here. There's two um this is just essentially another name for this game collection manager would be counter, right? It's just counting stuff. And um the increment and decrement are you know just fancy words for counting up and counting down. And then we have some sort of threshold. And once that threshold is met um we send out some sort of information uh some sort of change to the game state. Okay. And what else happens here? And every time we count, we send out a message just telling the UI to update the inventory. If you look at the game UI manager here, there's a bunch of, I think, very clearly named functions. Update inventory, uh, update score, update timer. I think hopefully clearly named things, right? depending on what you want to do. The state manager here is kind of a simple thing in that the game has pause, victory, game over, uh, and a restart button. Not everyone's going to need all of these, but they're there. And the important thing to realize is that these are um they should be, as far as I can tell, mutually um exclusive, meaning that the game can only be in one state. You can't be in multiple states at the same time. You either won or you lost or you're playing or you paused. And so, um, here I've got a separate thing for game state UI. If you look at this, this is a canvas. I'll screenshot this. This is the settings we're going to want for all of our canvi or canvases probably is the better word, the actual word. Um, scale with screen size 1920 x 1080. Uh, and in this canvas we have pause. If I were to turn these on, you'll see them all at the same time. There's a pause, there's a victory, there's a restart. Um, the pause is just a message saying that the game is paused. Uh, by by default, that's hardwired to P. That's just hardwired in the game uh state manager. If you want to change that key, you can change it there, but for right now, it's set to P. And so if I hit play and start doing stuff and then hit P it pauses right and so it does two this the script is managing two things when it goes into pause state it shows whatever is in the pause panel and then it also start shows the restart button the restart button everybody's configuration of this should be fairly similar it's just a you know I went to selected the canvas went to UI by and said button and then uh I will style this button to somehow match what I'm doing. And then every button already has an event here, right? And this one talks to the game state manager. And the game state manager has a uh restart scene function. And so if I pause the game, if I play the game and hit pause, I get the restart button and it can restart the game. Or I can There's no way to lose this one. You just sort of keep playing till you win based on this collection here. And then I hit the victory state where it turns on the victory which we could see over here. Right. So, this is enabled now as well as the restart. And so, I could play again there and it starts over. So, these having these, you know, like I'm trying to point out the stuff here, but I think these are really good. Look, some of you are going to use pretty much one model. Some of you are going to use combinations of things. Having this here in what should be a pretty working model uh I think can help in terms of being able to see exactly what's going on with the wiring of the events. The Yeah. So state manager manages the state UI manager manages the UI. I think pretty much everybody is going to have both of those for sure. In terms of the other stuff, other managers, you only want to include the other managers that you're going to need. Okay. So, uh there's that. Let's save. Um let's look"

I'll play this full screen. [Music] And there we go. Controller. I'll get this in a second. And so these are set up to just touch. If we touch them, these are puzzles. These are objects that have the puzzle switch on them. Uh, and there's three states for each switch. I hit it. There we go. And there we go. And the door goes down. And I All right. Good. Um so let's look at how this is working again state and game UI are there because the uh you know like this would move on to some other situation right but uh the pause the game state manager gives us the pause uh as well and so if I were to pause this I can just restart, which is super useful. Then, um, here's how the switches work. Let's look over here. So, this the puzzle mechanic stuff is two scripts. One is the switch in which the main things are defining the um I would say the main things are going to be the the primary thing is going to be the number of states right is it a you need at least two and be aware that when you're counting the states you start with zero. So the first state is not one, the first state is zero. Um you can also optionally define materials for each state and rotations for each state. Hence those things, but you don't need to. You can there can be some other animation that you're triggering. There's an output event. You could make anything happen with each state. Um and the second part of the system is the uh puzzle uh manager. And this one essentially um needs to get a reference to each switch. And it's continuously evaluating to figure out if you solved the puzzle. And then when you do solve, it's exactly what you would expect. We get a solve event in which you could do whatever you want. You could open a door. You could turn something on. You could declare victory. Whatever it is, uh, when to solve. So, here are the switches. Here's the switch thing script. And so the switch needs to have a name, needs to have a number of states. This these have three. Um, this is a readout to tell you what state it's currently in while the game is playing. Um, cycle states is on by default. Here's a list, an array of materials if you want to have it change materials going through the different states. And then if you want it to spin when it goes to different states. Again, you don't have to do that. These are just some pretty obvious ones. I thought it would be convenient to build in. Here's some animation controls for the rotations and then some obvious stuff for, you know, sounds. uh if we want to have different sounds when each one is um changed. Again, I'm trying to structure the interface such that you don't need to read the documentation to know what everything is. I'm trying to organize it similarly and make it work. And so there we go. Um how does the puzzle switch get connected to the puzzle manager? If I click on the puzzle manager that is up here and so here we have switch targets again an array right everyone's used to this visual trope now you hit plus to add another element to the array and in this every time we hit plus right the vocabulary I would encourage you here is that the array is a bunch of things. In this case, the things are strus which is a organization of things. And so we have multiple strus in each array. In this case, the strruct, right? Obviously short for structure here. Um, is a reference to the switch. And then this is what's what state does it need to be in to for solve. And so for all of them, the glowy state was state two. And so in order to solve the puzzle, they all need to be glowing, right? Two, two, two. If I change this one to one. Um, now in order to get the door to open, they would need to be glow glow purple or whatever the second one is. So there, there we go. There we go. And then I think one more here. There we go. And so that solves the puzzle now. And I can proceed. Right. So I can change in in the game. It would be your responsibility now to figure out how can I communicate to the player what is the actual state that these switches need to be in for the puzzle to open at that point. Um in the actual trigger zones for this how the switches are functioning. In this case, they're separate things, but there's a trigger zone I just sort of walk into here, and it has the typical trigger zone, and it just talks to the puzzle and calls the now totally functioning next state um function, which just causes it to go from zero in this case because it's a three-state switch from zero to one to three. And in the puzzle manager, we have just like I said on puzzle solved, talk to the door. And then uh I didn't even make an animator. I just used the action animate transform. And so, you know, this big cube here is the door and has one of these on it. And it is set to not play on start, not loop. And so, um, it's just sitting here doing nothing, waiting for a play message to just play this animation that simply just moves the door down on the Y axis, essentially opening, sliding down to open the door. But this could be it's an event. So, you know, could be could set off a bunch of fireworks or explosions. um whatever it is at that point. Now the third one",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Projectile Combat Example projectile example. Uh here the one new thing after wrangling a bunch of stuff. It was just too many clicks to make the animate um spawner with the uh with the animate script shoot things. Uh and so yeah, I'm trying to make this as simple as possible. So, the new thing here is um action spawn projectile, a spawner specifically designed for uh projectiles. And so there is a projectile prefab here and uh some settings for that uh designed to go forward in the Z. So, it's kind of doing the animation and the um spawning uh both things kind of managed together here. Uh great. Okay. So, here just let's see how this works. And so, what's going on here is I've got the player. Let's see. And I can X to jump and square to shoot. There we go. And I got these enemies coming after me. My controller is a little drifty here for some reason. But anyways, um, and notice there's a health. If I get hit by the players, my health is you're hit by the enemies. My health is going down. I've got a I gotta look up the dodge. Go. Running out of ammo. The green ones are health. The glowy ones are um ammo. And so there we go. Got that one. See that the items go up. And if I survive a minute, I win. Um here we go. This I thought I grabbed that one. The powerups only appear for so long. I win. Thank you. Thank you very much. I don't think I wired up the start button. Uh, okay. So, a lot more going on here. Let me step you through the things. Let's go one at a time. First of all, the this this is because there's so much stuff being spawned here. The powerups, the enemies. um that here that principle of like not having those communicate directly um is key. So that how can I structure my logic so that the permanent objects are the ones that are communicating the main game logic. So let's look at the powerups first. So, for instance, there are an enemy spawner, a health powerup spawner, and the projector powerup spawner. Uh, I think aptly named. Um, this one is just spawning things in a random circle at some sort of, you know, slow rate. And there's a prefab here called health powerup. And that's it. So, this thing is the thing that's like spawning those over the course soon as the game runs. The if we looked at the prefabs here in the health powerup, we'll see that uh it's fairly simple thing just has a trigger and a trigger zone uh that gets triggered by the player and the only thing it's doing this is important to take note of is that when it comes in contact with the player it, you know, turns itself off. Okay. So, how does the player get um health on the player? There is a um you know series of you could put these on a child object maybe for the sake of organization. That would be well, if you put them on a child object, you would need to make sure that the child object had uh a collider that was set to trigger down there. So, I guess it's simpler just to keep them here so you don't have to duplicate stuff because this is this is reading the capsule collider on there, which notice is set to trigger down here. Um, why are there three separate trigger zones? because they are managing whether we've come in contact with an enemy, whether we've come in contact with a health or whether we've come in contact with a projectile power up. I didn't take the time to rename that other tag. I should probably name it health power up just to be consistent so that I know what's happening. Um, and so it's here that um, when you come in contact with a health powerup, it talks to the game health manager, I think clearly named. And the game calls the heal and gives you 20 more health. And so if we look at the managers here, you'll see that there's way more managers, or I guess one more manager. um timer, health, projectile, which is just the collection manager renamed, and the state, and then there's also the UI here. Um, and so the health manager, you know, just essentially again is just counting down our health. you you know it's essentially the core logic is essentially the collection manager but just with stuff renamed like take damage heal so that it's pretty obvious but it's still doing the same thing it's just counting right um and so here um on health changed we just need to tell the UI to update so that we can see what's happening but even if you didn't have the UI you while you're editing you would be able to see what's happening up here while the game's the on death here. If we lose, it talks to the game state and goes to game over. So here, I'll lose once. Don't clap for this. Hit me. There we go. I'm getting hit. Uh, right. So, all it's doing right now is um decrementing the health, but we could be playing sound effects and uh colors and particles to get some more feedback. And there we go. Game over. Okay. I didn't ask you to boo the And then I could restart again. That's not wired up. Um, so update health talk to game over manager. Okay. Um, the shooting. So, there's a projectile prefab. And again, when we shoot uh enemies, we just turn ourselves off. Otherwise, it would just sort of like last for as long as it lasts and shoot through multiple enemies, which you know, uh you could decide how to handle that. And so again, again, note the fundamental principle of this prefab event is only configured to talk to itself. So I didn't drag the projectile from up here. Notice that there are no projectiles here. Why is that? Because they're being spawned by the spawner that's on the character. Um, and so the projectile for the event configuration gets dragged from over here to over here. Or you could click this and go to assets and search assets and that would make sure that we're coming from the assets. And so this is just turning it off. So how does it kill the enemies? If we look at the enemy over here, um, when it comes in contact with the projectile, it turns itself off over there. The So, that gets rid of those. Let's look at the enemy construction real quick. If I drag one of these in here. Um, and so this uh, you know, come in contact with the projectile, you get turned off enemy controller CC, similar to the character controller, except it's got a little bit of its own logic. And so you can sort of see how this works here. If I were to mess with this one, the main thing here is our detection range, right? If the player is outside of this zone, it will be ignored. Uh, and if it drifts in, the player look comes inside this area, then it'll start coming after it. And this is sort of how often the enemy is sort of like turning to face the player. And so if these numbers are bigger like 0.5 and two or something, we'll see it will have a different sluggish behavior. Yes. >> Is there like a the shape of the of the detection like a field of vision instead. >> Uh, not right now. I'll think about it. Where is the enemy I just made? Is he even on camera? He's like way over there. Let me turn off the enemy spawner so we can just see how this one works. All right. So, you can see it kind of moves in a straight line and then comes after me every once in a while. Come after me. Come on. Come on. So, a lot of your, you know, quote unquote difficulty here is going to be in um our settings here, right? In terms of how quickly and then obviously the speed at which uh the enemy can move there. So that that's going to be a lot for how aggressive the um enemies are. The Yeah. And then we have the same kind of situation here. It's sending the same parameters if you put an animator in here. And so that setup is like just like just like the character, right? It's just instead of using the joystick or the keyboard to propel the original thing, there's just a little bit of logic there on the top moving it around towards uh the character. So, there's that. Um, what else is on here? [Music] Yeah, so two things. When we talk to the uh Yeah. So the the actual hurting though like or the damage take damage is a function of the trigger zone that is on the um character saying that when I come in contact with the enemy I want you to do two things. Well, actually, yeah, here when you first come in contact, it subtracts five health. And then if you stay in contact, it subtracts one. But these are just, you know, arbitrary values I put in there. You could have those going anything. And then like the the frequency at which this one, this is important for who was talking about the on event stay. Oh, the the storm. You know, like it's this. It's going to be re-evaluated every second. You would if you stay in the zone, you're going to lose one health. every second right there in the way things are happening. Um and then and then you know the health manager is telling the UI to update and saying the game is over when you run out of health, right? But again, the total amount of health and what you're starting with and the max, like these can all be configured to be whatever you would want. There's also like a low health threshold. So if you drop below that, it sends a um event, right? So, if you wanted to do something and then if you get better, the co the uh projectile running out of projectiles is essentially the same structurally the same idea, but instead of using the game health manager, it's using the collection manager, which I just renamed to collection manager projectiles. But you see the script is actually game collection manager. So, there's 10. And so how did I uh get rid of get rid of ammo when I shoot in the spawner here? Um every time on projectile spawned, we have an event that talks to the collection manager that tells us to decrement, right? Decrement again being the word for countdown by one uh every time we shoot. And so that's telling this to decrease this number and then this uh what do you guys think? So I tried to come up this is a little bit of a more complex situation in that we have this threshold which is one in this case and so we have a threshold where this number is going down and then when you get more projectiles it goes back up and back down. And so the countdown um how do we actually run out of ammo? By the time we hit by counting down to it, we tell the spawner to turn off and that's going to mean that we can't send shoot any more projectiles. But when we uh surpass it going up, we turn the spawner back on. And that allows us to, you know, shoot. And then also every time we shoot count down on this number. And so like there's this communication between uh here. Yeah. Like when you shoot it counts down and when you run out it turns this um off. And then when you pick up a um power up on the player, which is here, here, here, right? When you come in contact with projectile powerup, it tells the collection manager to add 10. And then uh then you can move forward from that. The other uh sort of uh uh changing thing over the course of the game is the timer. And so game timer manager is just a clock essentially. And you can give it a time. You can tell it to countdown or up the you know if this box is checked it's up. If not it's down. Then um you can set thresholds. So multiple thresholds here that happen. And so again, this is an expandable array. You can put as many of these in here as you would want. And on uh at this time, in this case, the strruct includes an event. And so when we hit this threshold, we send this event. And so in order to make, you know, this tiny miniame more interesting, what what is happening over the case course of a minute here? >> Close. Really close. speeds up. >> Yeah, the the because this is the the spawner has a you know like it's not periodic. It has a min and a max. If you wanted it to be periodic, you would just set them to the same number, but um the max time is shrinking, meaning that we'll spawn more often. And so when we hit 40 seconds, it sets it down to three. I think it starts at like five or something. And then when we hit 20 seconds, it sets it down to one. And so it's essentially spawning a new enemy every second for the last 20 seconds of the game. And then when we hit zero, what happens? What's that? >> You win. [Applause] If you've learned anything from this class, um, victory at all costs. So, uh, obviously the, uh, doing something that's anything that's going to continue to uh, change over the course of the game, this is one of the main ways to do it. The this timer also has input functions so that you could start it and stop it um, if different things are happening. And the timer is linked to the game manager. You don't have to do that. Um, if you just hit pause, you see the timer stops. So, that's useful. Um, yeah. Uh, trying to think, is there anything else that's happening in this example? And so this is why the game was not restarting. In order to make sure the restart button restarts the game, I need to talk to the game state manager and I need to tell it to restart the game. Restart scene. There we go. So now if I pause and hit that, that button should work. There we go. Now, uh, controller is plugged in. If you're not getting anything, again, I I just tested it with the PS5, but um, as long as it's plugged in, well, you should get some default results from, uh, the PlayStation controller and the Xbox controller. Um",
    "transcript_segment": "projectile example. Uh here the one new thing after wrangling a bunch of stuff. It was just too many clicks to make the animate um spawner with the uh with the animate script shoot things. Uh and so yeah, I'm trying to make this as simple as possible. So, the new thing here is um action spawn projectile, a spawner specifically designed for uh projectiles. And so there is a projectile prefab here and uh some settings for that uh designed to go forward in the Z. So, it's kind of doing the animation and the um spawning uh both things kind of managed together here. Uh great. Okay. So, here just let's see how this works. And so, what's going on here is I've got the player. Let's see. And I can X to jump and square to shoot. There we go. And I got these enemies coming after me. My controller is a little drifty here for some reason. But anyways, um, and notice there's a health. If I get hit by the players, my health is you're hit by the enemies. My health is going down. I've got a I gotta look up the dodge. Go. Running out of ammo. The green ones are health. The glowy ones are um ammo. And so there we go. Got that one. See that the items go up. And if I survive a minute, I win. Um here we go. This I thought I grabbed that one. The powerups only appear for so long. I win. Thank you. Thank you very much. I don't think I wired up the start button. Uh, okay. So, a lot more going on here. Let me step you through the things. Let's go one at a time. First of all, the this this is because there's so much stuff being spawned here. The powerups, the enemies. um that here that principle of like not having those communicate directly um is key. So that how can I structure my logic so that the permanent objects are the ones that are communicating the main game logic. So let's look at the powerups first. So, for instance, there are an enemy spawner, a health powerup spawner, and the projector powerup spawner. Uh, I think aptly named. Um, this one is just spawning things in a random circle at some sort of, you know, slow rate. And there's a prefab here called health powerup. And that's it. So, this thing is the thing that's like spawning those over the course soon as the game runs. The if we looked at the prefabs here in the health powerup, we'll see that uh it's fairly simple thing just has a trigger and a trigger zone uh that gets triggered by the player and the only thing it's doing this is important to take note of is that when it comes in contact with the player it, you know, turns itself off. Okay. So, how does the player get um health on the player? There is a um you know series of you could put these on a child object maybe for the sake of organization. That would be well, if you put them on a child object, you would need to make sure that the child object had uh a collider that was set to trigger down there. So, I guess it's simpler just to keep them here so you don't have to duplicate stuff because this is this is reading the capsule collider on there, which notice is set to trigger down here. Um, why are there three separate trigger zones? because they are managing whether we've come in contact with an enemy, whether we've come in contact with a health or whether we've come in contact with a projectile power up. I didn't take the time to rename that other tag. I should probably name it health power up just to be consistent so that I know what's happening. Um, and so it's here that um, when you come in contact with a health powerup, it talks to the game health manager, I think clearly named. And the game calls the heal and gives you 20 more health. And so if we look at the managers here, you'll see that there's way more managers, or I guess one more manager. um timer, health, projectile, which is just the collection manager renamed, and the state, and then there's also the UI here. Um, and so the health manager, you know, just essentially again is just counting down our health. you you know it's essentially the core logic is essentially the collection manager but just with stuff renamed like take damage heal so that it's pretty obvious but it's still doing the same thing it's just counting right um and so here um on health changed we just need to tell the UI to update so that we can see what's happening but even if you didn't have the UI you while you're editing you would be able to see what's happening up here while the game's the on death here. If we lose, it talks to the game state and goes to game over. So here, I'll lose once. Don't clap for this. Hit me. There we go. I'm getting hit. Uh, right. So, all it's doing right now is um decrementing the health, but we could be playing sound effects and uh colors and particles to get some more feedback. And there we go. Game over. Okay. I didn't ask you to boo the And then I could restart again. That's not wired up. Um, so update health talk to game over manager. Okay. Um, the shooting. So, there's a projectile prefab. And again, when we shoot uh enemies, we just turn ourselves off. Otherwise, it would just sort of like last for as long as it lasts and shoot through multiple enemies, which you know, uh you could decide how to handle that. And so again, again, note the fundamental principle of this prefab event is only configured to talk to itself. So I didn't drag the projectile from up here. Notice that there are no projectiles here. Why is that? Because they're being spawned by the spawner that's on the character. Um, and so the projectile for the event configuration gets dragged from over here to over here. Or you could click this and go to assets and search assets and that would make sure that we're coming from the assets. And so this is just turning it off. So how does it kill the enemies? If we look at the enemy over here, um, when it comes in contact with the projectile, it turns itself off over there. The So, that gets rid of those. Let's look at the enemy construction real quick. If I drag one of these in here. Um, and so this uh, you know, come in contact with the projectile, you get turned off enemy controller CC, similar to the character controller, except it's got a little bit of its own logic. And so you can sort of see how this works here. If I were to mess with this one, the main thing here is our detection range, right? If the player is outside of this zone, it will be ignored. Uh, and if it drifts in, the player look comes inside this area, then it'll start coming after it. And this is sort of how often the enemy is sort of like turning to face the player. And so if these numbers are bigger like 0.5 and two or something, we'll see it will have a different sluggish behavior. Yes. >> Is there like a the shape of the of the detection like a field of vision instead. >> Uh, not right now. I'll think about it. Where is the enemy I just made? Is he even on camera? He's like way over there. Let me turn off the enemy spawner so we can just see how this one works. All right. So, you can see it kind of moves in a straight line and then comes after me every once in a while. Come after me. Come on. Come on. So, a lot of your, you know, quote unquote difficulty here is going to be in um our settings here, right? In terms of how quickly and then obviously the speed at which uh the enemy can move there. So that that's going to be a lot for how aggressive the um enemies are. The Yeah. And then we have the same kind of situation here. It's sending the same parameters if you put an animator in here. And so that setup is like just like just like the character, right? It's just instead of using the joystick or the keyboard to propel the original thing, there's just a little bit of logic there on the top moving it around towards uh the character. So, there's that. Um, what else is on here? [Music] Yeah, so two things. When we talk to the uh Yeah. So the the actual hurting though like or the damage take damage is a function of the trigger zone that is on the um character saying that when I come in contact with the enemy I want you to do two things. Well, actually, yeah, here when you first come in contact, it subtracts five health. And then if you stay in contact, it subtracts one. But these are just, you know, arbitrary values I put in there. You could have those going anything. And then like the the frequency at which this one, this is important for who was talking about the on event stay. Oh, the the storm. You know, like it's this. It's going to be re-evaluated every second. You would if you stay in the zone, you're going to lose one health. every second right there in the way things are happening. Um and then and then you know the health manager is telling the UI to update and saying the game is over when you run out of health, right? But again, the total amount of health and what you're starting with and the max, like these can all be configured to be whatever you would want. There's also like a low health threshold. So if you drop below that, it sends a um event, right? So, if you wanted to do something and then if you get better, the co the uh projectile running out of projectiles is essentially the same structurally the same idea, but instead of using the game health manager, it's using the collection manager, which I just renamed to collection manager projectiles. But you see the script is actually game collection manager. So, there's 10. And so how did I uh get rid of get rid of ammo when I shoot in the spawner here? Um every time on projectile spawned, we have an event that talks to the collection manager that tells us to decrement, right? Decrement again being the word for countdown by one uh every time we shoot. And so that's telling this to decrease this number and then this uh what do you guys think? So I tried to come up this is a little bit of a more complex situation in that we have this threshold which is one in this case and so we have a threshold where this number is going down and then when you get more projectiles it goes back up and back down. And so the countdown um how do we actually run out of ammo? By the time we hit by counting down to it, we tell the spawner to turn off and that's going to mean that we can't send shoot any more projectiles. But when we uh surpass it going up, we turn the spawner back on. And that allows us to, you know, shoot. And then also every time we shoot count down on this number. And so like there's this communication between uh here. Yeah. Like when you shoot it counts down and when you run out it turns this um off. And then when you pick up a um power up on the player, which is here, here, here, right? When you come in contact with projectile powerup, it tells the collection manager to add 10. And then uh then you can move forward from that. The other uh sort of uh uh changing thing over the course of the game is the timer. And so game timer manager is just a clock essentially. And you can give it a time. You can tell it to countdown or up the you know if this box is checked it's up. If not it's down. Then um you can set thresholds. So multiple thresholds here that happen. And so again, this is an expandable array. You can put as many of these in here as you would want. And on uh at this time, in this case, the strruct includes an event. And so when we hit this threshold, we send this event. And so in order to make, you know, this tiny miniame more interesting, what what is happening over the case course of a minute here? >> Close. Really close. speeds up. >> Yeah, the the because this is the the spawner has a you know like it's not periodic. It has a min and a max. If you wanted it to be periodic, you would just set them to the same number, but um the max time is shrinking, meaning that we'll spawn more often. And so when we hit 40 seconds, it sets it down to three. I think it starts at like five or something. And then when we hit 20 seconds, it sets it down to one. And so it's essentially spawning a new enemy every second for the last 20 seconds of the game. And then when we hit zero, what happens? What's that? >> You win. [Applause] If you've learned anything from this class, um, victory at all costs. So, uh, obviously the, uh, doing something that's anything that's going to continue to uh, change over the course of the game, this is one of the main ways to do it. The this timer also has input functions so that you could start it and stop it um, if different things are happening. And the timer is linked to the game manager. You don't have to do that. Um, if you just hit pause, you see the timer stops. So, that's useful. Um, yeah. Uh, trying to think, is there anything else that's happening in this example? And so this is why the game was not restarting. In order to make sure the restart button restarts the game, I need to talk to the game state manager and I need to tell it to restart the game. Restart scene. There we go. So now if I pause and hit that, that button should work. There we go. Now, uh, controller is plugged in. If you're not getting anything, again, I I just tested it with the PS5, but um, as long as it's plugged in, well, you should get some default results from, uh, the PlayStation controller and the Xbox controller.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 12, 2025 Input System Configuration that's part of the power of using the new input system. So if our default settings here are such that what should work out of the box um if it's just the character controller the left stick should move it around uh and X should jump as long as your jump is properly configured. Now, at this point, the um other stuff in terms of the shooting or the uh dodging here, right? So, I got to dodge uh with the circle is a matter of using um so the key decision here is there's two ways to do this. one key input key pressed. This will only work on keyboard. If you use input action, this means you need to configure the action editor and then it'll work on both controller and keyboard. So, um, if your game is only going to be keyboard, you know, make a note about that so that when people are playing it, they don't try to use the, uh, thing. And so, uh, for instance, the um, projectile here, if we look at the player projectile spawner, here we go. Input action. Okay. And so this is we've used input key. I think we understand how that script works. Only works with keys on the keyboard. Input action means that we're using the action um reference the action input action. And so if you search in your game and for just input, it's this thing right here has this little paper with a lightning bolt, whatever that is. Um, if you double click on that, it opens up this window, which we've discussed a little bit before. So for instance here, uh, attack is there by default. And if we look at attack um this the reason that an input action allows you to use both keyboard and controller is because of this sort of thing right it's saying that we've abstracted the mode of input into the this idea of attack right you can say you can attack from a controller or from a keyboard and so the stuff under attack here is what um does it and so I I believe I don't think I've changed this. I think this is the default is that on the keyboard it's enter and then on the gamepad it is um the west button circle or B on is that right? B A B >> A X >> X. It's I thought it was XY A. >> No. >> Okay. We all we all know what west is, right? So the the westward button. Um >> it's X. >> Yeah. >> Okay. I'm again, I'm just gonna give you the PlayStation buttons. It's this one right here, the west button, right? The one on the right. Um, so that that's what they mean there. I mean, that's what they're using. >> No, like like if you >> Oh, yeah. Sorry. This one. This one. Yes. I was thinking of the dodge. The the attack is going to be um square on PlayStation West. Thank you. Okay, so all of these things trigger attack. Okay, so how do you how how do you get this um out of here? Um using that script. And so this script here right here under action reference you should click here and it should show you the abstracted commands. And so you just pick you know attack here. If you double click that it populates this and that essentially connects this functionality to the input actions. Okay. And then uh yeah this is primarily what you'll be grabbing there. And so this just talks to the spawner and tells it to, you know, spawn a projectile then at this point. Um, so uh I know Bo was asking about that in particular and um in order to edit this for the other button. So uh interact should be there by default. I'm fairly certain. So that's the north button triangle. Um, and then then the one I think I added is that I came over here and I um duplicated interact, renamed it dodge, capital D, and then um selected this. And so uh here under the dropown like which button gets used this is where you can search through all of what's here uh on each thing right so again like I I I would discourage you from going beyond the four buttons on the right at this point right just try and keep our controls within within that um amount of stuff there. >> I don't know. Probably not. Like what did that even What kind of plug was on the end of that? Like proprietary? Maybe if you cut the end of the cable off and solder a USB to it. Good luck. Um, yeah, there in the in the official documentation they have, you know, all this listed, but most of us are going to be either using the whatever the new Xbox is or the PlayStation controller. So, um, so yeah, like for Bose's interaction, uh, or anyone else wanting to do interaction, a lot of that would look like this, where you would have a, um, trigger zone somewhere and then, uh, the on I would probably make a child object. And then on here, this would be uh uh input action event. Double click to um interact. And then here is where you would link all of the stuff in to make sure that you know because obviously the interact button is going to do different things. And so here with the trigger zone um this one here, let's name this. This is going to be interact. And so once you get this built then you could definitely use it as a proofab is that the trigger zone uh on trigger enter is going to um turn this on and then uh on trigger exit is going to turn this uh off. There you go. And so now uh I would save that as a prefab and then whatever you want to do on your interaction is what you would be triggering there. Okay. So, I think there's a lot there to look at with those. And yeah, um you just need to update, but I've done it a couple times now. And if you stay to the process and make sure you duplicate before so that you don't end up in a bad situation, that would be the best way. Yes. >> How do you duplicate the project? >> Just copy the folder. Well, I just I just go into the top level of the folder here, here, and just control drag it down. And then it's most most of what it's doing is copying the library, which you can actually delete. Um, but you know, for the sake of simplicity, this will be done in a second. And then, you know, make sure that you know which one's which while you're working. make sense. No. So, the um as I make changes and you know fix bugs and add a couple I mean we're we're pretty good now but um this link here which I'll just throw right in the chat right now. Bo asked about where do I get the new stuff? The new stuff, the new stuff is always here on the event game toolkit git package. And Bo, you you tested out the git for me. And so you actually have it functioning as long as you didn't build something new. And so you in your particular instance, you should be able to go into your package manager and it appears here as a package and you can say update. But in order to get that to happen, you had to make sure you had to get installed. I can't do it on school machines. And so, you know, it just ended up being a bridge too far. So if you know how this stuff works, then if you have git installed on your computer, you can come up here and hit plus install from git URL and then paste in the URL from this page and then add.get get at the end because it doesn't do that and then it shows up in the package manager but I didn't want to ask everyone to do that. I think it's a little bit more conceptually easier just to replace the folders. If you understand the stuff then that's great. So Bo you're in if you're still in the same one then you should be able to update and it should pull that stuff down. If not, use the other uninstall the package and then use the other updating method. But again, when you're doing the performing this kind of surgery, you want to not have Unity on. Okay? Like that's generally the better workflow. If you're directly saving again, that works just fine. You don't want the patient conscious when you're doing this.",

So, uh, starting to replace the gray boxing with our own assets or the assets that we're bringing in. I've talked about this before. You want to have the marquee assets have your signature on them and then start to incrementally build out our game logic. And so we want to be making substantial strides on both of those fronts moving forward. Make sense? Yes. >> Um yes. So the grounded check I I'll look at that. Don't expect any news from me on that front until Monday though. All right. And because I think it'll be better to present that. So everybody has a character that's moving around. Even if the anim if the grounded check thing is causing a few animation problems, we're going to be able to address that. So let's pause that development and move forward on the other stuff right now. Okay. So I'll be a little less accessible than usual over the weekend. I'm traveling. So uh keep that in mind. So rely on each other a little bit more this weekend. of limited internet"

Um there's two places. There's the RAM on the motherboard and this is used by the CPU. Then there's the VRAM uh with the video RAM and this is used on the GPU, the graphical processing unit. These are two different things. Uh you can see them in the task manager in here and in CPU or actually uh yeah CPU is just your core usage. However, um everybody's CPU at this point runs has multiple cores in it. And so you can say change view to logical processors. There we go. and you can see what's going on. So, this is both the good and still substantially um limiting part of uh computing. We've built all these CPU chips that have multiple cores, some sort of multiple of two, you know, maybe 12, 24. There's this other issue of like virtual cores. I don't really understand where one core is treated as two. Um, that's all sort of beside the point. The main issue here is that if your computer takes advantage of it, it's not the computer. If your software takes advantage of all of the cores, it's what's referred to as multi-threaded. And why not multi-thread everything, right? We've got all these cores. You don't want them sitting around not doing anything, right? Uh the problem is this is difficult. Uh you know, I don't really understand the hardware, you know, down to the metal applications of this. But the fundamental principles as far as I understand of what you think would be complicated is the complicated part where if I give Jack a job and I give Arlinka or I take the same job and I give half of it to Jack and I give half of it to Arinka and one of them finishes first, then what happens? Well, I need to wait for the other one to finish until I can turn the job in. Right? And so as far as I understand this is this metaphor holds true when we're multi-threading something is that this just idea of synchronization becomes a like a considerable barrier. Yeah. >> Yeah.

And then down here, this is the dedicated GPU memory usage. And so down here, you can see exactly how much GPU memory you have and how much is currently being used.

That is far and away the thing is gonna you're going to bump up against first, right? We're not going to turn on so many things that the render time is going to just crush, right? In terms of how long it takes you, far before that, especially because you know how to use Substance Painter now and you know how to make these big textures, you're going to run up, this will be the first, you know, hardware barrier you run up against. And so you can check in as long as you have like other stuff on your computer closed and you're not running God of War Ragnarok while you're trying to run your Blender project at the same time.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 10, 2025 Setting Up Materials and Shaders just looks uglier because of all the >> it looks uglier. It has this really problematic name like all around like I just not cool. And so everything's here by default which is wonderful. And if we come back over here, uh, and look at our shader view here, if I select this, we got to drill down over here. There we go. Oh, am I in it? Thank you. There we go. I was like, what is going on? Um, here we go. Uh, yeah. So, it does all of this for you, which, you know, not to be undersold. It doesn't organize it super well. So, like maybe some node doing your own node wrangling here, right? And so, having all of this use the UVs is obviously what we want and probably organizing it like this is obviously some of what we want. Uh we have our normal going into the normal map. Our roughness going into the roughness there. The the main thing here, right? So the part about you know running the named thing into the name is fairly obvious. I think everyone gets that pretty quickly. Unfortunately, there's some real gotchas in terms of the format. The main one being uh always just like in substance painter is this color data meaning uh RGB because then we're into a whole world of digitally representing color spaces bit depth a bunch of things there right yes >> what's the difference roughness >> in the map. >> And it has metallic and I forgot the other name. What's the difference? Yeah, it's just how it's organized, right? And then the underlying shader. So, you want like the you're want to set the output from substance to whatever your thing is in Blender. Uh let's look here. So with the there there's just not agreement about this value, right? So there's either some of them are organized as roughness values where that's this is the one I see more often where if you move it to the right it gets more rough and if you have it at zero it's glossy. But then there are other shader organizations or codes that use a value called glossiness, right? And that's essentially inverted roughness. So that when you move it to the right, it gets shinier as opposed to moving it to the right, moving the value up from zero to one and doing that. So >> the the default is uh and most of the programs all the everything we're using the default is roughness so that you know you turn it up and it gets rougher and that's the default in Blender and in like Unity if I were to open it up here there there's like shaders organized both ways. Um So there isn't really any difference in terms of how >> I mean there in all these instances there could be depending on the shader right and so the this just holds the data how the data gets rendered is a result of this which is why we have different pieces of code to I mean it's part of the picture this is part of the rendering right obviously the render and render settings are the other part But if you shift a in here under shader, right, you've got diffuse BSDF, right? So this is another, you know, code for shader code for like shader code, meaning it's um code that's running on the GPU. A lot of times the code language for this is um GLSF. Is that right? I have that right. the the language for writing shader code. GLSF GTSF GLSL GLSL Yeah. BSDF and GLSL. GS that's graphic graphic language shader graphic OpenGL shader language. So the GL being the GL and OpenGL and then SL being shader language and so stuff like this uh not like that that's HTML stuff like this right so this is the code that actually runs on the um GPU that takes in the um data that's in your textures and renders it. So, this is why there can be things that you know look good in Substance Painter, but then if you don't export them in the way that your render environment is going to evaluate the data correctly, then you then you end up with this issue, right? Or it just won't look right. So, uh, what other ones are open here by default? Uh, yeah. So, this is the other one. Glossy BSDF. Let's I'm going to make a new thing. And look at that. So, here. And make a material for this here. And then get rid of this one. and look at the glossy BSDF. And then uh here if we look at this, this is going into here. And then here, no, that one's still organized that way even though it's called glossy. Our code here is slightly different. Isn't there a second one here? I mean, they're trying to keep it all um the same. Diffuse glossy hold out volume. Yeah, those are all the same. But over here in Unity, make a new material some kind. Uh yeah because of it's coming out of different things under coming out of different rendering environments even under universal render pipeline here. Let's go back up. Oh okay. Yeah. in it's like two shaders combined, right? So, metallic workflow or specular workflow. So, yeah, you see that this input here essentially this is toggling between two versions of the code there. Whether you're providing a metallic map or whether you're providing a specular map, right? So depending on what you would send out of wherever you're designing your materials and textures, there's those two separate ways to structure it there. And then there's separate from that the glossiness issue in terms of like which which way does that go? Does it get more shiny or more rough? Although it does seem like things have coalesed around roughness which is you know as long whatever it is as long as it's like not switching all the time there. But that's what all of these are that all those green boxes in the shader graph. Those are all these they're just you know different pieces of code that are shaders that are going to load those textures and then render them on the screen. So getting the textures right is only the first part of it. You need to make sure that the textures are in you know rendered in a way or recorded in their you know uh textures sheet database with the proper format so that they get interpreted correctly by by this stuff. Right? This is why um like in we've been using a bunch of the mix models in like 240 and whatever their setting is. I think that's a result of this glossiness issue is that they're Yeah, it's their roughness, I think, which is inverted because that's how we've been fixing it, right? Haven't we been inverting putting an invert node after? >> Yeah. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, everyone who comes out of Miximo, if you dump them by into Blender by default, they look super they look like wet and sticky because they're just like their they're uh roughness is inverted. They look way too shiny. And so because of whatever the default uh however it gets imported, the default there is the opposite of what uh would be the natural thing there. So yeah, I mean in general once you've got your workflow down, you can kind of stay on task here and like, okay, this export gets everything formatted correctly for this shader that looks correct. And the the reason that Blender you know has uh you know the default is the principal DF BSDF is that the I mean the general consensus is that it's easier to just like okay I'm always",
    "transcript_segment": "just looks uglier because of all the >> it looks uglier. It has this really problematic name like all around like I just not cool. And so everything's here by default which is wonderful. And if we come back over here, uh, and look at our shader view here, if I select this, we got to drill down over here. There we go. Oh, am I in it? Thank you. There we go. I was like, what is going on? Um, here we go. Uh, yeah. So, it does all of this for you, which, you know, not to be undersold. It doesn't organize it super well. So, like maybe some node doing your own node wrangling here, right? And so, having all of this use the UVs is obviously what we want and probably organizing it like this is obviously some of what we want. Uh we have our normal going into the normal map. Our roughness going into the roughness there. The the main thing here, right? So the part about you know running the named thing into the name is fairly obvious. I think everyone gets that pretty quickly. Unfortunately, there's some real gotchas in terms of the format. The main one being uh always just like in substance painter is this color data meaning uh RGB because then we're into a whole world of digitally representing color spaces bit depth a bunch of things there right yes >> what's the difference roughness >> in the map. >> And it has metallic and I forgot the other name. What's the difference? Yeah, it's just how it's organized, right? And then the underlying shader. So, you want like the you're want to set the output from substance to whatever your thing is in Blender. Uh let's look here. So with the there there's just not agreement about this value, right? So there's either some of them are organized as roughness values where that's this is the one I see more often where if you move it to the right it gets more rough and if you have it at zero it's glossy. But then there are other shader organizations or codes that use a value called glossiness, right? And that's essentially inverted roughness. So that when you move it to the right, it gets shinier as opposed to moving it to the right, moving the value up from zero to one and doing that. So >> the the default is uh and most of the programs all the everything we're using the default is roughness so that you know you turn it up and it gets rougher and that's the default in Blender and in like Unity if I were to open it up here there there's like shaders organized both ways. Um So there isn't really any difference in terms of how >> I mean there in all these instances there could be depending on the shader right and so the this just holds the data how the data gets rendered is a result of this which is why we have different pieces of code to I mean it's part of the picture this is part of the rendering right obviously the render and render settings are the other part But if you shift a in here under shader, right, you've got diffuse BSDF, right? So this is another, you know, code for shader code for like shader code, meaning it's um code that's running on the GPU. A lot of times the code language for this is um GLSF. Is that right? I have that right. the the language for writing shader code. GLSF GTSF GLSL GLSL Yeah. BSDF and GLSL. GS that's graphic graphic language shader graphic OpenGL shader language. So the GL being the GL and OpenGL and then SL being shader language and so stuff like this uh not like that that's HTML stuff like this right so this is the code that actually runs on the um GPU that takes in the um data that's in your textures and renders it. So, this is why there can be things that you know look good in Substance Painter, but then if you don't export them in the way that your render environment is going to evaluate the data correctly, then you then you end up with this issue, right? Or it just won't look right. So, uh, what other ones are open here by default? Uh, yeah. So, this is the other one. Glossy BSDF. Let's I'm going to make a new thing. And look at that. So, here. And make a material for this here. And then get rid of this one. and look at the glossy BSDF. And then uh here if we look at this, this is going into here. And then here, no, that one's still organized that way even though it's called glossy. Our code here is slightly different. Isn't there a second one here? I mean, they're trying to keep it all um the same. Diffuse glossy hold out volume. Yeah, those are all the same. But over here in Unity, make a new material some kind. Uh yeah because of it's coming out of different things under coming out of different rendering environments even under universal render pipeline here. Let's go back up. Oh okay. Yeah. in it's like two shaders combined, right? So, metallic workflow or specular workflow. So, yeah, you see that this input here essentially this is toggling between two versions of the code there. Whether you're providing a metallic map or whether you're providing a specular map, right? So depending on what you would send out of wherever you're designing your materials and textures, there's those two separate ways to structure it there. And then there's separate from that the glossiness issue in terms of like which which way does that go? Does it get more shiny or more rough? Although it does seem like things have coalesed around roughness which is you know as long whatever it is as long as it's like not switching all the time there. But that's what all of these are that all those green boxes in the shader graph. Those are all these they're just you know different pieces of code that are shaders that are going to load those textures and then render them on the screen. So getting the textures right is only the first part of it. You need to make sure that the textures are in you know rendered in a way or recorded in their you know uh textures sheet database with the proper format so that they get interpreted correctly by by this stuff. Right? This is why um like in we've been using a bunch of the mix models in like 240 and whatever their setting is. I think that's a result of this glossiness issue is that they're Yeah, it's their roughness, I think, which is inverted because that's how we've been fixing it, right? Haven't we been inverting putting an invert node after? >> Yeah. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, everyone who comes out of Miximo, if you dump them by into Blender by default, they look super they look like wet and sticky because they're just like their they're uh roughness is inverted. They look way too shiny. And so because of whatever the default uh however it gets imported, the default there is the opposite of what uh would be the natural thing there. So yeah, I mean in general once you've got your workflow down, you can kind of stay on task here and like, okay, this export gets everything formatted correctly for this shader that looks correct. And the the reason that Blender you know has uh you know the default is the principal DF BSDF is that the I mean the general consensus is that it's easier to just like okay I'm always"

So, regardless of whether you agree with that or not, like that's what they're doing, you know, from from their standpoint. Um, yeah. So, there's that. Uh, over here, we've got these. The other thing I wanted to call your attention to here is this. Okay. Okay, so the this is the besides plugging in all of the cables, this color space thing that it's setting by default is really important. Um, so that the ones that have color which are going to be the emission and the base color are set to sRGB, right? They are evaluating the whole thing and then all three channels and the other ones are not using a color space to interpret the data. Without getting into it too much right now. So this is there this is influx and you know people are developing new standards for this um what are we when you read the colors right um the amount of red the amount of green the amount of blue there's several there's two primary complicating factors one what is the hardware able to actually display in terms of the brightness of the red, green and blue. Then there's this separate issue of what do we actually see? Right? So the one of the fundamental things here to take away is what do we see the best brightness by a large uh orders of magnitude. Our sensitivity to brightness is very fine-tuned. I mean, they've done all sorts of studies on this. Even with your eyes closed, like people can sense there's like blinking very small, very dim blinking lights. We're able to see this. Um, next to that, once we start to break it down into colors, right? Because the RGB is not some sort of random decision. That's how our eyes work. Our eyes have photo receptors that are tuned to red, green, and blue. So having the screens tuned to red, green, and blue makes a lot of sense from this standpoint, right? Um for those of you taking graphic design, this is not the case, right? Are you taking graphic design now? The when you print stuff, what colors are you printing? >> CMYK, right? Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Um, yeah, I can't speak to the historical precedent there. At some point, it became easier or the hardware, the technology sort of coalesed around those inks in those colors. I can't really speak to that at length, but the screens are designed because this is the way our eyes work. And the other thing you should memorize is which of these three are we most sensitive to? The R, the G, or the B? >> G. the G. Yeah. By a lot. Um, and so, so there's this. Okay. And a lot of what's going on here. I'm sort of parsing some of this for putting together a thing together for ABC 100 and trying to figure out what the latest version of Blender is doing with the color space conversion stuff. So we can talk about this in the next few weeks once I have it worked out to the point where I feel comfortable going through the whole thing. But it's not without its complication. Right? We have this you have to um consider how the data was stored, right? How the brightness was encoded. Is it strict linear or is it encoded on some sort of uh exponential scale where it doesn't increase um linearly? Why on earth would you do this? That sounds like it would be complicated. Yes, but this is the way we work, right? Both with sound and optical phenomenon. Like when you make a sound twice as loud, it doesn't sound twice as loud. You need three times as much dB or reduction in dB to make something sound quote unquote twice as loud. There's a bunch of, you know, we're in we're in per we're in how we perceive things at this point. And so, you know, there's lots of really really brilliant people working on all this stuff. And there's been lots of amazing experiments done, right? And so a lot of this is kind of quote averaged, right? In terms of like how and so there is variation from person to person, but uh yeah, there's how the data is stored, then there's how the hardware is displaying the data, and then there's how we're perceiving what it's showing. And so yeah, there's different versions of doing this. Not going to get into that today. Just know that that comes back to this decision here, okay? is that when we're not using color data, we're using this black and white, right? And the other thing you need to me memorize is that when something is just black and white, the mathy word here is this is scalar value, just one number, right? One number per pixel, just a black and white number. Um, and this needs to be correct in order to make everything look correctly look correct here, right? And so, for instance, if we let me close this because we don't need it open. If we brought this back in, if we look at this over here, is anyone saying anything? There we go. Tommy B, everybody still with me? Uh, if we do this, if we get out of this view and look at this render here, these are going to be slight differences, but you'll see differences. And so, for instance, if we take the um, which one is this? This is running to rough. That's metallic. Yeah, there's not much metallic here. So, we'll look at the roughness ones. If I told the roughness one to be interpreted as um sRGB data. Okay, keep your eye on the table. We should if I AB it'll show up. I think so. Let's test that. Um Okay. Uh, here we go. And so we'll use that testing that we talked about before. What do I have it set to right now? I have roughness set to sRGB. I mean, this will be a tiny There should be some visible difference, but we'll see. Um, control alt0 and F12. There it is. And so this is in slot one. We'll use that test thing. We've talked about this, right? Yeah. Slot two. Uh we'll set it to um non color scalar information. And then we'll render again. And let's look at this here. And so there's slot one, slot two. subtle, but you can see that, you know, there's a shift here in this table, you know, there's uh given the lighting and everything else, a little bit of a difference. So, the fact that everything gets set up correctly in terms of this, in terms of that, and route it into everything else, that all works really well. Also, did you add emission to this or did you just happen to use >> Okay. >> Yeah. So, uh obviously we don't have any blinking lights on this table and chair here, right? And so the emissive is not necessary. And from the Blender standpoint here, um, it's still a tech, it's a separate texture that's getting loaded. And so, uh, you could probably save yourself a little bit of, actually, let's see if we can actually tell, uh, if we look at here, here's our Okay, so down here, our dedicated Well, it'll be able to tell more accurately here. Um, we're using six of our 16 gigabytes. And if I remove the emission because there's nothing lighting up here. And delete this. Uh, I would need to make sure and zero. There we go. Um, and then we look back here. Let's see. And then we save. Save that. Yeah. Okay, there we go. Takes a second to update, but you can see that we are using slightly less. I mean, not slightly, that's 500 gigabytes, right? So, uh yeah, the thing uh it's less. Let me think about the other part that I was going to say there because I'm not 100% about that. Anyways, um yeah, I think I think Jack is right. that substance painter in the newest versions has been using emiss like the emissive channel. If you just make a new blank file, the emissive channel is already there. manually add it. Yeah, I I don't think that's true, but I'm not >> 100%. But >> but but regardless like either if you're not using a channel, you don't want to load this entire 2000 by 20,000 grid of pixels into your memory that you're not that you're not lo you're not using. Right? So I mean this this is why you know it takes a long time to load new areas in video games. Right? You walk into the new area and then like you know if the developers hide it well there's like a tunnel that you're walking through and then you get into the new area and while you're walking in that tunnel all of the textures for the previous area have been dumped and the new textures have been loaded into the VRAM so that they can be uh viewed. So yeah, regardless, I mean, whether or not you export it and whether or not it's sitting on your hard drive, I mean, that's kind of irrelevant, you know, like it's not taking up that much space from that standpoint. But when it comes to actually, you know, putting it in Blender and having it render the stuff, uh, it makes sense to not have stuff here you don't need, especially if you know you're working on a machine where you're like at the, you know, at the threshold of what what is capable there.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 10, 2025 Assembling Table Scene Elements We've got all of that. Um let's bring in my fork. So fork There we go. Looking good. Fork. All right. So, let's export this. Uh, I'm going to make a new folder in the folder for the fork. And again um export. Yeah. No image in here but you know we know how to handle it now. You understand what no exported it. Okay. So I may have adjusted the default Blender output here at some point. Um perhaps regardless uh we know how to handle it now. And so back over here, if I bring in more stuff uh here again, grabbing the USD, bringing this in should come in to scale, right? This is wonderful because we've taken the time at the beginning of the process to do the right thing and model stuff to scale. And that's looking good. And so everyone's understanding how that pays off. And let's see what's going on here. The fork looks not great, but maybe that's the emission. Let's see. Nope. The emission didn't get imported here. I thought Substance Painter said it was exporting it. Or did I just misread what I said? What I saw? Uh, let's look in here. No. Okay, it's not there. And so what is the deal here? So I think uh especially with metallic stuff, right? Most of what we're seeing, especially here, is the HDR, right? So putting something in place at this point to know because remember by default it's nothing right reflecting nothing. So let's put some sort of placeholder in there. Sure. Okay. And so now if we were to look at this now it looks okay. I'm I'm okay with the way it imported. Um I don't think there's something fundamentally wrong there. But like I said, it's, you know, you record the textures coming out of Substance Painter, then they come in, they get loaded into a different shader. So, let's say you want to make an adjustment. Should I go back to Substance Painter and make a change? I mean, is it some sort of like like you need to paint part of it black or like put some red dots on it or something? Like, yes, you should go back there and do that. But is it something that like h I wish it was a little bit shinier or less shiny? like that's all changes you probably should make here, right? Um and so for instance, uh the metallicness of it, right? The best way to make these changes is that we want to keep this data. We just don't want to overwrite it, but we want to uh change the way that it's, you know, being be able to shift it one way or the other way. And so our ramp is going to be the easiest way to do that. And so here in the roughness for instance, if we put that in there just by dropping it in after this uh that should look exactly the same. I not entirely certain. Let's look. Yeah, looks pretty much the same. I don't didn't see anything really shift. Yeah. So the default ramp value should be completely um standard. And so now um you know smooshing this down to take the data and make more of it white or make more of it dark or perhaps uh adding a new node in the middle. And this will sort of change the balance. You can take it and stretch more data over in this way to make it shinier or not. And so we have that. I have that one really bright point light I put in there. I'm going to turn that off so we get some more shadow happening. And yeah, so if you bring in your highly metallic stuff like your silverware and it looks terrible, there's nothing nothing's being reflected. So the other thing instead of bringing in HDR, the other thing you can do is this. The reason this is there, the material preview is so that uh what does this do? It automatically loads this HDR so that you can see this kind of thing right away, right? That there's some reflections in there so that you can make some judgments about what's going on with your material there. Um, but remember that the HDR in this view mode is not the one that's actually in the render. So, keep that in mind. But in terms of like getting a quick, you know, like checking the metal like, wait, does this did I do this wrong or does it just not look right? And you can just click over to that view to get that preview of it. Okay, we've got this in place. Let's go ahead and save this. What happens in that game? I've never played that game. >> It's a weird game. You're stuck in an office making like you can either do what wants you to do or the narrator wants you to do or you could do what narrator does not want you to do. gets more angry. >> So, it's like going to work. >> At some point, like there's buckets involved because he realized that Stan might be an idiot because he doesn't know what the bucket is.

Uh, I'm going to make a new folder in the folder for the fork. And again um export. Yeah. No image in here but you know we know how to handle it now. You understand what no exported it. Okay. So I may have adjusted the default Blender output here at some point. Um perhaps regardless uh we know how to handle it now. And so back over here, if I bring in more stuff uh here again, grabbing the USD, bringing this in should come in to scale, right? This is wonderful because we've taken the time at the beginning of the process to do the right thing and model stuff to scale. And that's looking good. And so everyone's understanding how that pays off. And let's see what's going on here. The fork looks not great, but maybe that's the emission. Let's see. Nope. The emission didn't get imported here. I thought Substance Painter said it was exporting it. Or did I just misread what I said? What I saw? Uh, let's look in here. No. Okay, it's not there. And so what is the deal here? So I think uh especially with metallic stuff, right? Most of what we're seeing, especially here, is the HDR, right? So putting something in place at this point to know because remember by default it's nothing right reflecting nothing. So let's put some sort of placeholder in there. Sure. Okay. And so now if we were to look at this now it looks okay. I'm I'm okay with the way it imported. Um I don't think there's something fundamentally wrong there. But like I said, it's, you know, you record the textures coming out of Substance Painter, then they come in, they get loaded into a different shader. So, let's say you want to make an adjustment. Should I go back to Substance Painter and make a change? I mean, is it some sort of like like you need to paint part of it black or like put some red dots on it or something? Like, yes, you should go back there and do that. But is it something that like h I wish it was a little bit shinier or less shiny? like that's all changes you probably should make here, right? Um and so for instance, uh the metallicness of it, right? The best way to make these changes is that we want to keep this data. We just don't want to overwrite it, but we want to uh change the way that it's, you know, being be able to shift it one way or the other way. And so our ramp is going to be the easiest way to do that. And so here in the roughness for instance, if we put that in there just by dropping it in after this uh that should look exactly the same. I not entirely certain. Let's look. Yeah, looks pretty much the same. I don't didn't see anything really shift. Yeah. So the default ramp value should be completely um standard. And so now um you know smooshing this down to take the data and make more of it white or make more of it dark or perhaps uh adding a new node in the middle. And this will sort of change the balance. You can take it and stretch more data over in this way to make it shinier or not. And so we have that. I have that one really bright point light I put in there. I'm going to turn that off so we get some more shadow happening. And yeah, so if you bring in your highly metallic stuff like your silverware and it looks terrible, there's nothing nothing's being reflected. So the other thing instead of bringing in HDR, the other thing you can do is this. The reason this is there, the material preview is so that uh what does this do? It automatically loads this HDR so that you can see this kind of thing right away, right? That there's some reflections in there so that you can make some judgments about what's going on with your material there. Um, but remember that the HDR in this view mode is not the one that's actually in the render. So, keep that in mind. But in terms of like getting a quick, you know, like checking the metal like, wait, does this did I do this wrong or does it just not look right? And you can just click over to that view to get that preview of it. Okay, we've got this in place. Let's go ahead and save this. What happens in that game? I've never played that game. >> It's a weird game. You're stuck in an office making like you can either do what wants you to do or the narrator wants you to do or you could do what narrator does not want you to do. gets more angry. >> So, it's like going to work. >> At some point, like there's buckets involved because he realized that Stan might be an idiot because he doesn't know what the bucket is.

Part of that is going to matter with what we're doing with the camera. And so if I could control alt0 here, let's come in and get a better view of this. Maybe down here like this for now. Uh I'm going to grab my focal length and maybe bring it in. And I'm also going to look through the camera. So, view uh camera to view. There we go. So, I can sort of uh get this a little bit more how I would want. There we go. So, I can see a little bit better what I'm doing. Just hit the home key. We're going to get some more stuff in this scene, but let's leave it at this for now. And let's look let's turn this off and try to set up some shallow depth of field here with what we're doing. And so we want the forks to be in focus. Um and so let's look down from the top. And part of what we're going to do here is uh adjust the camera uh and the depth of field. So over here under uh render depth of field um first we need to turn on the camera depth of field. There we go. Now uh what do we want to focus on? There's two different ways to do this. We can either dial in the focus distance in which case I thought we saw No, we're not going to I thought for sure there was a gizmo last time we did that. I can't remember. Um we talk a lot about this in 240 depth of field here. The f-stop is going to be important. And then this is the thing we're going to focus on is here. If we look through and now we dial in the focus distance, you can see what's happening. And your values should matter because you modeled to scale. Okay? If you modeled it weird in that it was like really really tiny or really really big, then you might have to go in and mess mess with these values a bunch. And so here, for those of you who don't know, when this number goes down, the blurry parts are going to get blurrier. When the number goes up, the whole image is going to get clearer. So here, our foreground is out of focus. Our background is softish, but our forks are the thing that's in focus. We can sort of hold down shift while you're dialing this, and you can see it happen. Or you can just go focus on object and then just click on the object you want to be in focus. Right? So that makes that pretty easy. And then like I said, if this number goes down, if I put it at one, blurry stuff gets blurrier. If I make it five, everything is much more in focus. You know, this is a little bit soft here. Um, and that back there is a little bit soft. And so this situation makes our table texture situation more usable in that if we're going to have the shallow depth of field, we don't need, you know, here where it's closer to the camera where it would looks blurry because it doesn't have enough pixel density, doesn't have enough pixels, doesn't matter quite as much because it's a little bit out of focus because we're using the shallow depth of field. So there's that. Um, the other option is to go back into Substance Painter and export it again with the 4096 textures and bring those in. That might be an option there. Um, but yeah, for those of you taking photography class or are taking 240, we go into a lot more detail here, but what you I write down in my notes is that a lower f-stop number is going to make the depth of field shallower, that you'll be able to have less of it in focus. The easiest way to pick what's going to be focus is just to click on here, go back and look through the camera. Let's say I want the front chair in focus and everything else to be out of focus. So, I just clear this out and then pick this chair. There we go. And it's still kind of blurry. I don't know. Sometimes this object thing is doing it based on the anchor point of the object which in this instance may be far enough away from this part of the object to matter. And so if that's the case, your best bet is to use this and just hold down shift and just sort of dial it in till the thing you want in focus is in focus like usually like using an actual camera, right? Um, holding down shift is pretty necessary to make sure you can really dial it in there. Cool. Okay, let's make a wine glass and look at some of those issues. So, let's get some reference here. Um,",

In this case, I'm going to use the cylinder with the subdurface so that we have a little bit more incremental control over the smoothing of it. And so I'm going to say only in orthographic view there. And over here, this is going to get renamed to uh reference cube. And then turn that off for now. And over here, let's save this whole thing. in here and save and maybe be able to dial this down a little bit. And then let's make a new cylinder and make some changes here. I want to be conservative in the number of subdivisions because I'm going to add a subdivision surface. So again though, I'm making a radial thing. And so nine times out of 10, even number, it's going to let you divide it into half, divide it into quarters. Unless you're doing a five armed starfish, uh it you almost always makes sense. So here I'm going to go 12. And then our radius, I'm going to say three inches. And then under depth, um, what was it? 12 inches. And that was 10. 10 in. And there we go. That gets me in the door. And now I can tab into edit mode and start to adjust this. So, for instance, we can uh scale this down and figure out what our maximum is there. Probably bring this up a little bit and start to make some adjustments. Uh let's really just sort of like get the basic changes of shape then see what other stuff we need to do in terms of working with the uh subdurface. So uh selecting these when I'm in X-ray mode should allow me to scale stuff down and then it's got to come back out here. So, I'm just going to move this stuff up to where is the thickest point? Like maybe right about there. And then um yeah, let's look at this. Do we have caps on this? I think we do. I'm going to get rid of those for the time being. So, let's get rid of that one, just the face. And let's get rid of this one, just the face. uh because that's going to change how the subdurface works. And so now if I come back to here and I come back to here and turn this back on. There we go. And so now let's go to edge mode actually. Like so. And so I can E. And then I want to make sure I coming straight down. So then press Z to lock it and get to right about here. And then S. Bring this in there and then find our next change in shape. Right about here. E Z S. Getting there. And then E Z S right about there. And then E Z S about like that. And then E Z right about there. Okay. And let's see what that looks like. Okay. Feel good about the general profile of this. And um this is going to be glass, right? So, the double-sidedness of it and the accuracy of the double-sidedness is going to matter much more than the other stuff that we've made up until this point where you didn't see through it and the way that light was bouncing around inside of it wasn't really something we were concerned with, right? And so, we need to be able to control for those things. And so for instance here on the wine glass there's going to be this internal part here right because this part has thickness and then in here it also comes up like this which causes some stuff in there. But let's get the profile a little bit closer here. Let's come in and call this wine glass. And then let's go ahead and throw the subdurface on to see where we stand with this. And maybe a two there. And let's uh tab out and shade smooth obviously so we can start to get a better feel for what this is going to look like. And come back in here. And now we can start with some um you know controlling edges to try and get the shape a little bit more representative of what uh what we want here. Right.",

I want to be conservative in the number of subdivisions because I'm going to add a subdivision surface. So again though, I'm making a radial thing. And so nine times out of 10, even number, it's going to let you divide it into half, divide it into quarters. Unless you're doing a five armed starfish, uh it you almost always makes sense. So here I'm going to go 12. And then our radius, I'm going to say three inches. And then under depth, um, what was it? 12 inches. And that was 10. 10 in. And there we go. That gets me in the door. And now I can tab into edit mode and start to adjust this. So, for instance, we can uh scale this down and figure out what our maximum is there. Probably bring this up a little bit and start to make some adjustments. Uh let's really just sort of like get the basic changes of shape then see what other stuff we need to do in terms of working with the uh subdurface. So uh selecting these when I'm in X-ray mode should allow me to scale stuff down and then it's got to come back out here. So, I'm just going to move this stuff up to where is the thickest point? Like maybe right about there. And then um yeah, let's look at this. Do we have caps on this? I think we do. I'm going to get rid of those for the time being. So, let's get rid of that one, just the face. And let's get rid of this one, just the face. uh because that's going to change how the subdurface works. And so now if I come back to here and I come back to here and turn this back on. There we go. And so now let's go to edge mode actually. Like so. And so I can E. And then I want to make sure I coming straight down. So then press Z to lock it and get to right about here. And then S. Bring this in there and then find our next change in shape. Right about here. E Z S. Getting there. And then E Z S right about there. And then E Z S about like that. And then E Z right about there. Okay. And let's see what that looks like. Okay. Feel good about the general profile of this. And um this is going to be glass, right? So, the double-sidedness of it and the accuracy of the double-sidedness is going to matter much more than the other stuff that we've made up until this point where you didn't see through it and the way that light was bouncing around inside of it wasn't really something we were concerned with, right? And so, we need to be able to control for those things. And so for instance here on the wine glass there's going to be this internal part here right because this part has thickness and then in here it also comes up like this which causes some stuff in there. But let's get the profile a little bit closer here. Let's come in and call this wine glass. And then let's go ahead and throw the subdurface on to see where we stand with this. And maybe a two there. And let's uh tab out and shade smooth obviously so we can start to get a better feel for what this is going to look like. And come back in here. And now we can start with some um you know controlling edges to try and get the shape a little bit more representative of what uh what we want here. Right."

And then we'll bring this back and look at some of the uh interactions here that this works. Um okay, everybody ready? Here we go. So we So we are going to need to unwrap it, but this should not be crazy. Uh we just want to be able to uh unfold this fairly easily. Probably a seam up here. And so let's do that. I'm going to save incremental one more time. Then apply this. Then there we go. There we go. I got everything together. Uh down here actually. Yeah, a little bit of weirdness there.

So we're going to want something here. We need to cut it up and down vertically. Uh, so the grid fill is wrapping that around in Sim 4D. There was a great way you could stop that. But anyways, here we're going to need a lip seam there. And we're going to need a seam here as well. So, I'm going to put this maybe on the inner part over here and here. And we'll mark both of those as seams. And then we'll get this part here. So, probably easier to do from this view. And straight lined up there. And so, I'll click here.

Need to get the rest of the way. Right here. Not that one. That one. Okay, that's good. That goes the whole way to the seam. The other seam and down here. That does as well. Let's mark that. Let's look at the UV unwrapping. Okay, we're getting somewhere. Uh, so this is the entire inside, right? And so we want uh you want that laid flatter. This is the bottom. That's not bad the way that is. Uh we here we're getting this straightened out. And so, uh, yeah, we'll see what happens here. We may want to straighten this one out, I think, because of the way things run up and down. Let's come in here and work this one out. And then There we go. And grab everything. And let's uh run this again. There we go. A little bit less distortion over here. Uh and we should have something. Did I get something strange there? No, that looks fine. That's just that bottom part. And so here, if we come in and press N, look at our UV toolkit. Um, here, Ctrl L, grab these. Um, yeah. So, let's look at what happens here. If I come in and bring in a UV checker, we can see, you know, it's not lined up with the shape or the UVs because of the way this unwrapped here. And then also, uh, doesn't, you know, sort of run with the geometry either. So, in this case, I think it might be a good idea to explore having these turned into like a grid in order to fill up more space here. And um I think this will work with the uh projection that we use over there. So, if we grab tab back in uh grab this tab and then our button here that does this is gridify which is I just saw it right there. There we go. Now, I knew what I had was a grid of squares, right? So that works in this instance. Now we see that this is lined up crossing across here. And we can do this. We should be able to do the same thing with the inner wall, I think. There we go.

Uh mostly it's a onetoone with like name conversions when we're going to Blender. When we're going to Unity, um that's where there's that texture uh packing into one channel. You can see more complicated things here where lots of stuff gets thrown into one channel. Don't worry about that for now. Back to here. Uh, we need we've got everything we need except for the translucency that needs to get into this map. So, we need to create a new um, gray because we don't need it to have RGB information. We just needed to have uh scalar information. We take our translucency and drag it onto there and say from translucency. Is it doing it? No, it's not doing it. Let's try it again. Let's say RGB and drag it over. We've got this set. It's working when I've done this obviously before. What am I missing? We make a new gray one. There we go. What was that? Why was that different? Gray. Grab translucency. Drag it on there. If I say from translucency, it doesn't make the connection, right? You can tell because it doesn't make a little color icon here that's actually populating over there. But if I come over here and say gray channel, then that lines up. Let's try it a little bit differently. I'm going to take the alpha channel and say duplicate it. Then can I drag this onto here? There we go. Okay. Now, the only thing it is Wait, no, that was the wrong one. So, alpha channel duplicate. Drag this onto the duplicate. Say store in all three channels. There we go. Then you got to change the name, right? So this is how it gets output. Uh and so here under alpha we need to change it to translucency. There we go. Let's give it a test. Uh, I need to be able to tell for sure whether our data is getting through here. And if it's just one value, it's going to be tough. So, I am going to just throw some sort of noise onto the translucency channel so that it'll be obvious, very obvious what's happening. And so, let's try it now. Let's export um export textures. Make sure I use the output template I just set up which is at the bottom. Here it is. And put it in this folder. And let's export. And it is exporting a translucency map. So that's good. But let's see what it looks like. Is it actually getting the data that we want out of Substance Painter? Yay or nay? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is this is right. This is the noisy information I just threw on there and it is going through into the thing. It's really hard to tell in the output template under this this window is hard to wrangle here. Right? And so this is going to here. That shade of gray is the same as this one. So this data is going to there. So again, the process was duplicate the Blender template. Select, hit the duplicate button. In the duplicate, first of all, name it something probably with translucency in it so you know what it's doing. Then duplicate the alpha channel by again pressing the duplicate button. Then rename the alpha channel to translucency and then drag the translucency information onto here. The key being it didn't seem to like it if I said from translucency. I mean, now it's doing it, but I'm not sure whether So, either from translucency or",
    "transcript_segment": "So, I already have one here, but I'll make another new one. I'll hit plus. And so, down here, new preset number one. Uh, right. I made sure I had the Blender principled BSDF selected when I hit plus so that it used that as the uh, actually, I did that wrong. Never mind. uh come back to Blender principal BSDF and then hit this button so that you actually duplicate it. There we go. And so now in here I'm going to uh name this one translucency 2025 just to differentiate it from the other one I've been making. And then uh over here we need to right this whole window is telling you which of the input maps. So the input maps are going to be these over here, the things that you're working with in Substance Painter. How do they get mapped to the output over here?

Okay, so let's do some things where this is actually going to matter. So for the time being, we'll just ignore uh this weird triangle situation. Um, and here. So, we obviously want this to be very see-through. So, we're going to turn this up quite a bit. Maybe just below here. And let's say we want part of it like a gold rim. Let's make it silver. I'm not that gaudy. So, um here let's go ahead and make some gold silver uh silver rim and a little bit of height difference here. This is going to be metallic and uh very shiny and We only want this on the top. And so in this case, uh I think our easiest bet is going to be to uh make a black mask. Uh look at this in orthographic view and hold down alt so it lines up and a shift. And so now we can come into the mask mode, come into uh the polygon select, come into the polygon fill. And now that issue of the polygon selecting the whole way through the object, we can kind of use to our advantage to create this um pretty clean lip around the top of it, like so. So you can see make it a little bit raised there from where it was. I might uh blur this mask just a few pixels. And then maybe give this a little bit of texture. chill that out. We're going to see that seam there a lot. So, I'm going to change the projection on this to trip planer. That helps. Yeah, this being buted up against this maybe presents some issues here in Maybe having a little bit more space in the UV map there between the islands would be advantageous. Let's go back to UV projection. And we'll call this glass. Uh, one of the other things we can do here is on our base translucency roughness comes way down. Uh, I think you can look make it look more like glass in the shader. Again, if you come in here to translucency is on the index of refraction is just giving us a strength there. Uh that's fine for now. Uh, okay. So, we got that metal rim on there. Uh, let's get some fingerprints on this glass. So, I may do that in a separate fill layer here. And let's experiment with some things. What if we just put them in roughness and look at the tiling, you know, too much and it you can see it clearly happening there. In our case, we're getting that distortion because the the gridify here. Um, so maybe it makes sense if this is more tripplaner and then uh adding a levels to the roughness, which is the only one we're working with here. And sort of just bring in like a little bit of that. So that's when it's just on the roughness there. Um if we were to give it um that looks pretty good, convincing. I mean depending on how close we get. I mean I I don't know. I like that uh on the roughness channel. The other thing you can experiment with is uh having it on the translucency channel, right? And so here, let's see if we get a major difference um for what's going on. And if we put the same map on it and we were to work the balance again a levels Here. And since we mapped both sides, right, we have the inner and outer wall, you have things happening, you know, like there's information happening on both. The trip planer means that we don't get these weird uh stretched fingerprints there. They're just sort of in. If I only wanted fingerprints on the top, like where people were grabbing the glass. Uh, again, a black mask and, um, a paint. And I could sort of bring those in only where I wanted on the top. And if I went inside here, a little bit inside. Again, I have a soft brush, so it's really kind of judiciously applying that. And I'm not getting as much on the stem and everything, depending on how far down I would want to go here. And probably want a little bit of glass wobble here, right? Um, again, CG2 perfect by default. Make another fill layer here. And again, I'll call this glass wobble. And it'll be in the height. So, in here, um, let's get some sort of very, we don't need a lot of detail. Just make it a little bit less regular. Yeah, we'll try this into the height there. And first thing would be the scale. There we go. Maybe right about there. And then of course salt to taste. Right. There's none. And then adding just a little bit. So now as you would look around, looks much more like a blown glass thing. Figuring out exactly how much of this you would want. Let's see what's going on there with the is the seam a total result of this? It may be. How about the fingerprints?

If we were to build this up piece by piece, let me disconnect this, this, this, this. Okay. And so if the roughness is way down. Yeah, I think this HDR is maybe let's try a different one. What's going on? Blender kit. Okay, let's look at this one again. Yeah. So IR of one is completely transparent. The light will not bend going through it like so. But glass should be right around 1.5. Although we've had some weirdness with this in the past. Let's try something a little bit lower one. Okay, that might be a little bit more what we're after. Um, Yeah, using the real world I value seems to like not even though we modeled a scale for whatever reasons what happening in uh yeah it's a Okay, let's hook things back up. That helps our lip there. That's back. Here is our roughness. There we go. So that gets that happening. And then back here, our normal map going into the normal and our translucency going into the transmission. So we're getting some of the action on the surface. We bring down the alpha and it starts to look a little bit more see-through. Yeah, I'll do some research as to why the values are kind of strange there. And I have a feeling if we had a different HDR, but it's not loading one for right now. And let's check in over here. Uh the only other thing here let's can try is let's experiment with perhaps a different shading model. So, um, let's look here. So, if we run this in, let's see what happens in EV. So, again, put it back at one. If we were to bring this up just slightly there, that's a little bit better. And then for our roughness values, what if we ran our And it now shows up. Okay. that's looking better, but we're just not seeing through at all. So the one major change there was uh under material um thickness slab rather than sphere. Sphere is definitely more distortion there. Slab seems to be a little better. And then I could put in something that's actually a close I value. And that seemed to be a bit better. And maybe this film thing is slightly better. But we're still not really getting that double wall look in any instance. Sort of going through it there. Okay. So after all that finagling just with the regular setup once you bring in the transmission here making sure that the material itself has you know these all these you know glass wrangling a lot of it ends up being things that are in the material shader code right so um rate trace transmission Is that better? That seemed to get better. Let's look. Here's dithered. It's very slight. I feel like we're seeing more of the double wall there. And yeah, the sphere is definitely way more distorting the IUR. So, we definitely want slab. That's definitely better. All right, it's pretty close. Let's see what we can do to get a little bit better. But that feels certain a little bit more in tune if we were to look at this under our focus distance here. Yeah. Looking through the camera, I feel like that's better.

That helps our lip there. That's back. Here is our roughness. There we go. So that gets that happening. And then back here, our normal map going into the normal and our translucency going into the transmission. So we're getting some of the action on the surface. We bring down the alpha and it starts to look a little bit more see-through. Yeah, I'll do some research as to why the values are kind of strange there. And I have a feeling if we had a different HDR, but it's not loading one for right now. And let's check in over here. Uh the only other thing here let's can try is let's experiment with perhaps a different shading model. So, um, let's look here. So, if we run this in, let's see what happens in EV. So, again, put it back at one. If we were to bring this up just slightly there, that's a little bit better. And then for our roughness values, what if we ran our And it now shows up. Okay. that's looking better, but we're just not seeing through at all. So the one major change there was uh under material um thickness slab rather than sphere. Sphere is definitely more distortion there. Slab seems to be a little better. And then I could put in something that's actually a close I value. And that seemed to be a bit better. And maybe this film thing is slightly better. But we're still not really getting that double wall look in any instance. Sort of going through it there. Okay. So after all that finagling just with the regular setup once you bring in the transmission here making sure that the material itself has you know these all these you know glass wrangling a lot of it ends up being things that are in the material shader code right so um rate trace transmission Is that better? That seemed to get better. Let's look. Here's dithered. It's very slight. I feel like we're seeing more of the double wall there. And yeah, the sphere is definitely way more distorting the IUR. So, we definitely want slab. That's definitely better. All right, it's pretty close. Let's see what we can do to get a little bit better. But that feels certain a little bit more in tune if we were to look at this under our focus distance here. Yeah. Looking through the camera, I feel like that's better. Although this down here still isn't quite doing what I would like. And in here. And in here."

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 10, 2025 Event Game Toolkit Structure Everybody with me so far? Okay, good. All right. So, we've got that in place. Um, where is the event game toolkit? And right, it's here. I am going to delete this. So, over the weekend, I was trying to get it to work with Git and some of you downloaded Git. think I'm not going to think I'm going to take that out because it's just an extra level of um yeah figure out I may put it on the Unity store or something eventually just a different way to update it. Anyways, everything is here but if we look in this folder we've got a couple things. documentation is kind of what it says it is. Um, we've got a couple documents here about using the decal system. I'll get to what that is later about using the character controller and the interaction system um over here. Okay, so there's some prefabs. I think it's just the character controller prefab, right? So, this has all the stuff that we've talked about previously, all of the parts that make our underlying character controller uh work, right? So, this being the heart of it, but then it needs all of the other things there. We went over that in detail previously. Um, where are actually all the scripts? All the scripts are in the folder called runtime. Okay, so these are the ones that you directly use. Okay, meaning runtime meaning like these are scripts that evaluate while the game is running. Okay. Um there's other folders here because some of the scripts have like fairly sophisticated editors like that dialogue one, right? that allowed you to preview the different parts of the dialogue and then create these very large expandable arrays of strrus and stuff like that. Um, and so those sort of complimentary scripts are in the folder called editor. Do not touch this. Right? in general like I wish Unity was more robust in this way but like I mean it's a it's fragile in the way that just computers are fragile in that um yeah if you changed one of the underlying fundamental parts you could corrupt the system. Um, and so you're primarily concerned with the documentation and the uh runtime. In runtime, it's organized into folders. And so actions, these are scripts that do something. Um, animation, these deal uh with, you know, animating something. And so that action, animate, transform, remember I showed you that example last Monday. That's in there. Uh, the character controller is self-explanatory. That's where the character controller is. Some of the managers here we'll use today. Primarily, I'll show you the health manager, right? So, you want your character to have health. Not everybody is going to do that, but a lot of you have that in your plan where you're like, \"My player needs to get hurt by obstacles andor enemies, right? And so that's the health manager is going to be the primary hub for managing that kind of thing.\" Um, and input is the other one where here we're managing whether we're pressing a button on the controller or on the keyboard or we're using the mouse or we're quitting the game, right? Sort of functionality level stuff. Um, there's not a lot in the physics one except in the platformer. We talked about the platform animation script be previously. Here's some stuff for some puzzle functionality. And I think that's primarily where we're at here. Okay. And so runtime where all of the stuff is and now that you can kind of see what the naming conventions are, right? Um everything that does something has the word action in it. And so if you're not really sure what it is you're looking for, if you come over here and just write action, all of those scripts will show up here in the search. Okay. Um, and if you're trying to control something, if you type input, all of the input ones show up here. So, those are the two main keywords. Uh, action and input, those those would be the ones that sort of show you most of what's in there. Um now in terms of generating",

I'll get to what that is later about using the character controller and the interaction system um over here. Okay, so there's some prefabs. I think it's just the character controller prefab, right? So, this has all the stuff that we've talked about previously, all of the parts that make our underlying character controller uh work, right? So, this being the heart of it, but then it needs all of the other things there. We went over that in detail previously. Um, where are actually all the scripts? All the scripts are in the folder called runtime. Okay, so these are the ones that you directly use. Okay, meaning runtime meaning like these are scripts that evaluate while the game is running. Okay. Um there's other folders here because some of the scripts have like fairly sophisticated editors like that dialogue one, right? that allowed you to preview the different parts of the dialogue and then create these very large expandable arrays of strrus and stuff like that. Um, and so those sort of complimentary scripts are in the folder called editor. Do not touch this. Right? in general like I wish Unity was more robust in this way but like I mean it's a it's fragile in the way that just computers are fragile in that um yeah if you changed one of the underlying fundamental parts you could corrupt the system. Um, and so you're primarily concerned with the documentation and the uh runtime. In runtime, it's organized into folders. And so actions, these are scripts that do something. Um, animation, these deal uh with, you know, animating something. And so that action, animate, transform, remember I showed you that example last Monday. That's in there. Uh, the character controller is self-explanatory. That's where the character controller is. Some of the managers here we'll use today. Primarily, I'll show you the health manager, right? So, you want your character to have health. Not everybody is going to do that, but a lot of you have that in your plan where you're like, \"My player needs to get hurt by obstacles andor enemies, right? And so that's the health manager is going to be the primary hub for managing that kind of thing.\" Um, and input is the other one where here we're managing whether we're pressing a button on the controller or on the keyboard or we're using the mouse or we're quitting the game, right? Sort of functionality level stuff. Um, there's not a lot in the physics one except in the platformer. We talked about the platform animation script be previously. Here's some stuff for some puzzle functionality. And I think that's primarily where we're at here. Okay. And so runtime where all of the stuff is and now that you can kind of see what the naming conventions are, right? Um everything that does something has the word action in it. And so if you're not really sure what it is you're looking for, if you come over here and just write action, all of those scripts will show up here in the search. Okay. Um, and if you're trying to control something, if you type input, all of the input ones show up here. So, those are the two main keywords. Uh, action and input, those those would be the ones that sort of show you most of what's in there. Um now in terms of generating"

But the bad part about or just the innate part of it is that this isn't very uh discoverable, right? You're sort of getting into a folder, getting into another folder, and then looking at this, and it just shows you the code. It's hard to really make heads or tails of what's going on here, right? Um especially if you're coming in um not knowing. So, I am going to create a new scene here. And I'll just right click and say new scene. And I'm going to call this um game toolkit map. And then just open that scene and just have it be totally blank. And here we can run this script, right? So the you're famili you're mostly familiar with the scripts that run at runtime, right? They do something in the game. You can also script the editor, Unity editor itself, right? And this is a script like that. It's running not during the game. It runs in the editor to do something. Um, and yes, addon. >> Yeah. I mean, the whole thing's like an add-on. Yeah. Yeah. The whole package all together, right? And so, um, I made a blank. It's important to make a new blank one because this is going to generate a whole bunch of stuff and you don't want this stuff in your, you know, main place where you're working. This is a separate scene. So, you can look at all the stuff. And the script that does this is up, uh, if you add editor functionality, most of the time it's up here in this tools menu. And so you'll notice that there's a couple things here. This is the company that makes the dot tween add-on I told you about, which is, you know, I built some of the stuff on top of that because it's such a good library for just like fundamental animation tweing. Um, and then uh yeah, script documentation generator is the one we're looking at here. And so I'm going to go to tools script docuation generator. And this, you know, it's going to make this big map, but uh you need to tell it where the scripts that you want it to map are. And they are in that runtime folder. And so this is assets. Uh because I brought this in from a zip file, there's like one extra layer of folder here, which is not wonderful. But can I copy this path? Yeah. So, I'm going to go go to the runtime folder, right click, and say copy path. Then come over here and controlV. There we go. That makes that easy. Regardless of how many layers of folder there are. So again, path, right? The map of like this folder is in this folder and this folder in this folder and there's the file. Um, good. And then you just say generate documentation. And boom, there it goes. Okay. So this is set up in 2D view. I would go to 2D over here and zoom out. And now you can sort of see all of the stuff here at one time. Zooming in and being able to see exactly what the input functions are. Again, I've gone through quite a bit of trouble to have every script itself with a little bit of description and then a little bit of description about what the input functions are and what the output events are. Remember always input on left, output on right. We talked about this at length at the beginning on last Monday, right? Okay. So now once you've done that once um for the most part you're done. Okay. Like you can come back and look at this map later just you know whenever you want to look at the documentation here. Um, if you update any of the scripts, which I'm not going to try not to do for everybody, we'll see. I tried to bug check a lot of this stuff, but I probably didn't get it 100%. There may be some scripts that some of you may need to update. And then if you need it to be you need the documentation to be updated, fortunately, that's pretty easy. You can just um uh delete this object and then just run the script again under tool script documentation. Right? So everything that you saw there is like underneath one parent object. So you just delete that parent and everything gets cleaned up and again over here copy path and over here controlV and generate documentation. Oh, yeah. There's even a button for if you don't want to have to hit delete like an idiot, you can just hit this button and it's uh not technically less button clicking. It's still one button click, but yeah, depends on what you want to do. And so, this is all there. And so, we'll be referring back to this as we're working today. But yeah, I'm not going to go through every script and every function. I tried to create a lot of stuff that's like a core that covers a lot of what everybody's going want to do and then some ancillary things which I think would cover like a lot of um additional functionality for people who want to um build some other more complex things by chaining um a lot of this stuff together.",

Actually, let's look at the one I kind of covered at the end, which is uh I I want to input I want to my game to create things, right? new stuff. Um, and we look over here under action action auto spawner spawner. Um, and so this is the script that manages spawning stuff. And so think of it as a machine that just like makes new things. This is a whole computer. This is a whole concept in programming called the uh event or sorry um factory pattern, right? there certain patterns regardless of even what lang computer programming language you're using sort of higher level ways of organizing logic of the way things function in the factory is one of them right you've got this script abstraction that manages making other stuff in the game and so yeah this is one that does it and you see that we can um generate new stuff so let's look at how this works and some key things here um with this. So, I'll come back to here and we'll come back here. Um where am I? I just select the player and press F and that always gets me back to someplace. If I'm stuck in 2D, that's remember that's this toggle up here. You can turn that off. And now we're back in 3D world. Um, and I'm going to go ahead and reset this game object. And then create a spawner. And so I'll look for spawn action auto spawner. There we go. And uh, this is here. Spawn prefabs. This is the thing that we're making. Um, spawn rate, right? So, this this is essentially a lot like a particle system, but for game objects. Okay, so but it's similar to a particle system in that it's like a thing that's making other things. You shouldn't use it at the same magnitude that you use a particle system, right? In general, it's not going to be a good idea to have it spawning thousands of game objects in seconds like it is with the particle system. Particle system is more of a visual effect. Those sprites are not functional game objects and they don't have the same kind of like weight and in the computer. Um, and so by default it's sort of mu spawning things within a certain amount of time. uh and our position range so that they don't spawn uh on top of each other. And so we need something to spawn here. And so let's set that up. And so I'm going to go over here to prefabs and I'm going to make a new cube. There we go. And I'm going to put the rigid body on this so that it's you know move can move around. And I'll call this spawn cube prefab. And let's give it some kind of material. Sure. More like that. Okay. And then um I'm going to make it a prefab by bringing it down and put putting it in my prefabs folder. We're all used to this. Uh then over here, I'm going to re label this object to spawner so I know what I'm doing. Again, the name doesn't matter. It's just for my ability to organize things. And that's there. And here under spawn prefabs, here's where I can tell it what to do, right? because by default it doesn't there's nothing for it to spawn and so you need to say yeah here's a thing for you to spawn and once again I'm gonna click here and this really matters when we're talking about spawning right do we talk about do we want to reference something that's an asset or something that's in the scene and most of the time we want to be doing something that's an asset because if it's in the scene and it gets deleted then we're trying to spawn something that doesn't exist and so But for right now, we'll make a we'll do the prefab here. And there it is. There it goes. All right. And so now I can delete the one in the game and I'll be okay because it's referencing this one, which is an asset, which assets don't get deleted during the game. So if I hit play now, we'll see it's spawning some stuff. There it is. It's randomly making a new one every somewhere between 1 second and 5 second interval in between. And you see that they're sort of piling up over here. And eventually they get high enough that they're being spawned on top of each other. And then because they have the rigid body there, the things happening where they can't be in the same place at the same time. And so they kind of like blow up. But you see that like the physics is impossibly accurate or like just st like it's sort of bizarrely stable. I mean you saw this last time when I did the hurried example um where like the spheres were stacking on top of each other in a way that would just never happen in real life.

One is that um this as far as creating like these more uh organic distributions of objects like just scattering things around like having them happen like this kind of gives you that quote unquote for free here. And the other thing to know is that the character does have a rigid body push on it. And so even though it's not technically a rigid body, we don't need to get into that for right now. It can push them around. Now, it's not going to get pushed by the boxes really, but it can push the boxes. Okay, so especially for puzzle functionality, if you need to shove something on top of something else into a zone or something like that, this works for doing that. Now the other thing to really understand here when you're looking at this is that the default is that the objects are just um existing in perpetuity. And so this is really an important thing to understand is that um almost always you want spawned objects to clean themselves up, meaning delete themselves. Otherwise, you get because how long will someone play the game for? possibly, right? Um there's no time at which we're done. And so if your objects just if you keep making more objects and all the objects just continue to exist, you're going to run up against performance issues. The game will, you know, like if you it goes on for a long time, the game will eventually crash because it will, you know, just eat up all the memory with all the game objects, right? This is polygons in phase numbers are important but the primary thing that students run into in terms of performance is they do something and they sort of inadvertently create you know a million game objects in the game and that's where the performance really really takes a hit. Okay. And so just like with particles, we needed to define a lifetime um for the prefabs. And fortunately, uh that is in the spawner script. You can say, hey, these things um need to clean themselves up. It's important to know that zero for lifetime equals never die. Okay. So, um, we want to have something longer than zero. And if we check back over here, we're still making more cubes, right? And you can see how, you know, if this kept running for the entire duration of the game, eventually this whole place would become polluted with cubes, right? It's like a And you you saw what's happening over there in the uh object manager as well. Okay, over here in the spawner, uh let's look at this and uh our spawn lifetime. Okay, and so here uh let's say seconds. This is in seconds. And so now if we start watching it here, let's have it make some more cubes. So like the min and max I'll put closer to each other. So it's making them a little bit more quickly. And we'll see it start making, you know, a bunch of things here. I'll push them over. And we'll see that these start cleaning themselves up there, right? They delete. And so you can choose exactly how long they're going to exist in the game and just how much density for these objects you're going to need. So these could be um this is the system for managing any the generation of anything at runtime. So could be enemies um but doesn't not every enemy would need to come from a spawner. It could be enemies that you It may make more sense to just place your enemies throughout once you have the level prototyped, right? In terms of like where they should go. Um, but here, yeah, you see, never gets that like crazy amount of density because it's just there's a balance between these values and this value. Does that make sense? Okay.",

It was really always there but the player didn't know it. And then when you enable that by maybe coming over a trigger zone for a powerup that then turns on this thing, that's what happens. Uh so let's maybe have a different type of object here for the player to spawn. Maybe something a little bit more functional like something you could actually jump on. And so if we had a cube here that looked like that. Um let's go ahead and reset this. And I want this to be a little bit bigger in this direction. Maybe kind of like that.

And so let's get the animate. We we could do this quote unquote by hand or we could use our animate transform here. Um, and we want it to go forward on the Z. There it is. And so this is going to be position Z. We want it to just go forward like so. Um, we wanted to go further and so this is our mapping. We want to start at zero, go here and we are going to be offsetting play on start do not loop. Okay. And so, um, if we have that configured correctly, when we hit play, we should see this just sort of like zoom in that direction. And let's check that out. Yeah, zoom is a aspirational term for what just happened there. uh and so let's say one and then no there's no multiplier I just put the value here so let's say 20 and now maybe something more akin to zooming okay that works um maybe a 40.

Now, there's just staying in put, but even when it's in this one, it's not adopting our rotation. I'll update that dropown menu, but the rest of the process is exactly the same.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 10, 2025 Collision and Trigger Interactions Let's move this out of the way. Let's take this and move it over here. And let's make a different material for this. Okay, in order we're going to have trigger zones here, but in order for these to function, they need to one of them once we have overlapping stuff here, uh, we need to have some kind of rigid body in the system to register the collisions, right? Because right now, if they're both are triggers like this and we were to put an input trigger action or input uh trigger zone here on this one, um what do we want to have happen here? We're going to need a separate tag, right, for our projectile. And so, let's take care of that first. Under our prefabs, under our projectile in here, I'm going to go up to untagged and make my own. Right. So, if you were shooting different things, you would need to have um and you wanted them to do different things in the environment, they would need to have their own um tags. And so, I just put projectile. I'm just using the convention that the tags have lowerase. And so, here um when we What do we want to have it react to? Not the player, but the projectile. Again, being super careful to get that right because this is one of this is the when you set up systems where you can just name things that's super flexible, right? You can just keep naming stuff and make new things. That's really great. However, the bad side is that for the code evaluation part of it, it's that the um the computer's not going to let you know that you just spelled projectile wrong. it just knows that it didn't match and it's just not going to do the thing. Um, okay. And so here, uh, on enter this object will go away. So off needs to get the off message. Um, and here, let's save and hit play. And let's look over here. Yeah. So, we're making contact, but why isn't anything happening? Um, you can't have two two triggers if they don't have any rigid body. don't do the collision testing. And so let's adjust that over here. This one here. I'm not going to do it to here. I think it makes more sense to put it over here. So let's put the rigid body on. But uh we need to have the rigid body for the testing part, but we don't want it to be doing the physics stuff. If that's the case, then this box is the solution to that problem. Meaning that now instead of having the rigid body do its physics calculations, this is kinematic, which I wish had a different name, is essentially going to say like no, the movement now is going to be either controlled by an animator or by a script. And so because there's no animation or movement script on this, it essentially, you know, just still keeps it in place. And so there we go. I'm going to make my projectile larger so it's easier to see what is happening. And so in here and here. Double click to go into prefab mode. And any change I make here goes to all the prefabs. There we go. Come back out. Look over here. Okay, we're close. What is our deal here? We're making contact. We've got this Ah, our projectile needs to be tagged. We made the tag, but I didn't apply it to the thing. Boom. Literally in the system here. Um, now this could be all of the destruction stuff, right? So, set off a particle system, play the explosion sound, all of those things because this has come in contact. So, let's just make a chart here of what's going on. So, over here, let me turn the projectile back on. So over here we have the um action animate that's the thing that's actually moving it forward. We have the um the collider set to trigger and it has the tag on it. That's our main parts there. Over here we have got the collider again set to trigger. Um and then we've got the rigid body needs to have is kinematic in order to just have it not bounce around. And then this has the trigger zone and it's set to only look for the projectile which is the tag in this case. And that puts these things together so that they this thing can shoot and eliminate that thing at this point. So then again getting a ton of functionality out of like some very minimal things here, right? the action animate, moving things around, the um spawner to just create things in the game, and the uh trigger zone, which really allows us to make decisions when things hit other things. The the thing that gets everybody is, you know, it's not totally obvious. You put triggers on both things and you're like, \"Oh, it should work.\" But you need to have that rigid body on there or else it just doesn't get evaluated in the collision system. So that needs to be in there. Um yeah, and making that automatic, like having it automatically make that probably didn't seem like the right choice to me um because it's not the thing you would need to have in all cases, but in this case it works. So there we go. uh we're able to shoot other things. You know, ideally, this probably has its own tag here. If you're going to have things that can hurt you, it usually makes sense to have some kind of uh enemy tag.",

And so because there's no animation or movement script on this, it essentially, you know, just still keeps it in place. And so there we go. I'm going to make my projectile larger so it's easier to see what is happening. And so in here and here. Double click to go into prefab mode. And any change I make here goes to all the prefabs. There we go. Come back out. Look over here. Okay, we're close. What is our deal here? We're making contact. We've got this Ah, our projectile needs to be tagged. We made the tag, but I didn't apply it to the thing. Boom. Literally in the system here. Um, now this could be all of the destruction stuff, right? So, set off a particle system, play the explosion sound, all of those things because this has come in contact. So, let's just make a chart here of what's going on. So, over here, let me turn the projectile back on. So over here we have the um action animate that's the thing that's actually moving it forward. We have the um the collider set to trigger and it has the tag on it. That's our main parts there. Over here we have got the collider again set to trigger. Um and then we've got the rigid body needs to have is kinematic in order to just have it not bounce around. And then this has the trigger zone and it's set to only look for the projectile which is the tag in this case. And that puts these things together so that they this thing can shoot and eliminate that thing at this point. So then again getting a ton of functionality out of like some very minimal things here, right? the action animate, moving things around, the um spawner to just create things in the game, and the uh trigger zone, which really allows us to make decisions when things hit other things. The the thing that gets everybody is, you know, it's not totally obvious. You put triggers on both things and you're like, \"Oh, it should work.\" But you need to have that rigid body on there or else it just doesn't get evaluated in the collision system. So that needs to be in there. Um yeah, and making that automatic, like having it automatically make that probably didn't seem like the right choice to me um because it's not the thing you would need to have in all cases, but in this case it works. So there we go. uh we're able to shoot other things. You know, ideally, this probably has its own tag here. If you're going to have things that can hurt you, it usually makes sense to have some kind of uh enemy tag."

We're able to use projectiles to go after things. We're able to uh have things triggered in the environment based on that. Let's go ahead and look at the health manager thing. So, let's save this. Come back to here, our runtime under our uh managers. Yeah, under game. Uh, so there's a bunch of things here. We talked about the camera manager already, uh, in terms of, you know, turning on and off cameras. Um, let's look at the health manager here. For the most part, um, yeah, I think all of these I'd have to I think pretty much all of these should live on their um own game object. meaning that you know it's like a part of the logic that exists outside of the sort of physical part of the game and you want it to always be there monitoring and sitting there waiting for it other things to send it messages and so every anytime you use one of the managers and not everybody pretty much nobody should use all of them right like that's not the plan um you need to choose which ones make sense for your game functionality and then put those in your game system. Right? So, because again, how much complexity do you want? Just enough, right? You've you've all done this enough now, a couple months to see like gh like I did too much junk here and now this is like unwieldy, right? And not only in that like I don't even really understand what I did, but then also like being able to use it going forward is also compromised. So, we want just enough stuff. uh bullets over here. Let's go ahead and look at that. So, gre and we'll call this uh game health manager. And I'll reset it even though it doesn't really matter, you know, like it's just a blank game object. Um and we'll put this on here. Go. And so this is what is um showing us it's the thing that's managing um the health, right? And so you have some sort of amount of health that you start with some sort of current amount um and we can receive messages here. Uh so for instance, let's make something very simple here again. Uh, I'm doing these all here. I think it might be a good idea that if you're just trying to isolate, learn how one thing works, make a new blank scene, just do that thing, then be like, \"Okay, this I got this to work here. Now I can put it in my bigger system.\" Because the good side is that you can get all sorts of emergent effects by combining all these things. The bad thing is that you can get all sorts of emergent effects by combining these things, right? Like there, you know, like emergence is just, you know, is is that what you wanted or not, right? Because there's plenty of ways that uh you can have these undesirable emergent effects. Uh okay. So, we are going to make this enemy hurt us. And uh we are going to tag it as enemy. There we go. And then uh on our trigger zone here, this is the one for us shooting at it. Uh but we need to manage the player it getting to the player separately. And so that needs a separate bit of logic because the the trigger zone here filters according to um tag. And so and and that's good, right? And so uh here uh this is going to uh affect our uh enemy. And so uh or that's what we're evaluating for now here uh or sorry this is we're on the enemy here which I will now label just to name the object to keep everything straight. What are we what are we looking to interact with here? The player. And so here um when this is all true, we do this stuff here. And what do we want to do now? Now we want to talk to our game health manager. Uh we've made contact with the player. And so here, if we look at this, uh we want to take damage. And so here, this would be the amount of damage that this enemy does upon making initial contact here. And so we'll say just so that we can see what's happening. And then we'll look over here. So we're starting with 100. If we make contact, we should see the current number go down to 90. And so there we go. Let's test that out. Need to stop randomly shooting things. That one is off. Is there another projectile somewhere? Turn that off. Delete that. Delete that. There we go. Okay, there we go. All right, we are not shooting that enemy. And if we were to load this up now and then come over here and make contact with this enemy. Boom. We got hurt.",

Again, this is the challenge of setting up these kind of systems is that you want the systems to be able to talk to each other, but you don't want the systems to be dependent on each other. Whereas, if one system stops functioning or is just absent that all of the others you change, you create this cascading chain of breakage, right? where it's like the whole system is 100% required on everything working 100% of the time. That ends up being a very fragile system. And so that's part of the reason things are um broken out here. So with that in mind, um, yeah. So now this the play the enemy is communicating that it um hurt the player here, right? So take damage. And so now, I mean, what what kind of other stuff do we want to have happen when that happens? >> Yeah. Uh, the the player turns red. There's some sort of other visual cue, perhaps a particle of some kind, probably a sound, right? Um, and so the I would probably you want that to happen every time the player gets hurt. And so over here in the game manager, there's outgoing events so that instead of having to configure those effects, so like make the player red, make the player spit out the particles that you know the hurt part, the red particles or whatever it is. Um, if you configured them on the enemy, that would work, but then you would need to make sure that that's configured correctly on every enemy, right? Versus if you came over here to the health manager and you configured it here on damage received, then every time the player takes damage, no matter what it's from, you're getting all of that that whatever functionality you set up is happening there, right? And um the other principle to keep in mind here is that the enemy is like a dynamic game object where if you kill it, it goes away in the game, right? And so putting a bunch of functionality on the objects that are not always there. It if you can have it be on one of the persistent game objects, then it's not going to uh it'll be much, I think, easier to manage. And so here um yeah on damage received here we'll put a particle system on the player for testing and we'll just put it on sphere mode. uh 30 or no uh this is not going to do because it'll just give it the we'll give it the message to just you know emit stuff and we'll make it uh very short lifetime. So just one and start speed like that. Okay. Uh, and this will be damage visualizer and this gets put up underneath the player, right? So, you see how much stuff is coming up here underneath the player, right? And essentially, you know, you get your player configured to be to be able to do all the things and then dynamically turn those on and off as the player's abilities change throughout the game. Um, in this case, we want this to stay on. And so now here, when the player takes damage here, here, and what do we want to have happen? We want to emit um oh here not the renderer just the system. There we go. Emit particles. Okay. And so now uh go save and play. And I didn't reset the location of this. There we go. Now it's actually centered on the player. So the particles will come from the player when it gets hurt. There we go. Now uh also what happened there? Watch it one more time. This is every everybody needs to un visually be annoyed by what you're about to see. Ready? Everybody watching right now? Here we go. >> Landon, why was that terrible? >> Disappear. >> Yeah, it disappeared. What did the particles do? Did it seem like >> But watch their movement. Watch it one more time. Yeah. See how they're moving with the character there? Yeah. Not Not good. It looks They don't look like they're just things that were thrown into the environment because they're a child of the thing that spawned them, right? And so uh this is one of the most important parameters on the particle system which is right here. Everyone write this down. Most of the time we want simulation space to be world. And so they get spit once they're spit out then they're on their own. This is how you would intuitively think that they would work most of the time, right? So there we go. We got hurt. There we got hurt again. We're getting hurt. And let's look at our health manager here. And yeah, we've been taking damage the whole time. And so let's save and uh down here on death. uh once we run out of health here. This is yeah anyways when it goes to zero and so yeah that's hardcoded at zero.

Now, that's all in trigger zone. just your one-stopes one-stop shop for triggering. And so here, okay. And so we do want to know if we came in contact with the player, right? And now Amy, what's next? Right. We've got this. It's a trigger. We've got this. Is this configured correctly? Right. We want this thing to give our give us more health. And so who who are we looking to make contact with? The player. The player, right? And so this is correct, right? The default here is that it goes to player, right? Um and so when we enter here, um Jack, who do we want to talk to? >> This is the box. This is the first a box. >> You talk to the health manager. It's like it's like the player has health insurance. Like like you want to make the player better, you don't talk to them. You talk to their health insurance and then negotiate. >> Anyway, >> nice to ask. >> I mean, there's got to be like satirical health insurance games on Steam, right? I haven't really looked at that, but like Yeah, don't get me started. Okay, so uh yeah, the health manager here uh we want to heal int and we will he 20 And then what else do we want to do here? Probably. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like get rid, you know. So you can't just keep healing yourself here. And so this will be first aid. All right. This is good. I get the feeling you guys are understanding like like I made this big thing that has a lot of possibilities. The good news is there's a lot of possibilities. The bad news is, right, you guys getting the getting the the trope of my of my education here, right? Um, the Yeah. And so we need to clean this up. We need to clean up first aid and say game object set active off. Okay. And we need to look here. All right. And so our current health is 20. If we pick this one up, actually we need to make sure that our we're starting off with 20. We need to make is higher than that so that we see a change in the number and then go from there. And so now there we go. And if we pick this up, there we go. We picked it up. And we are healthier. Cool. Uh, great. Okay. And so, uh, your game will probably have a few of these I might start to that you'll need to, you know, be interfacing with on a regular basis. And so, I might make a managers um, box and then start to accumulate my managers in there like so. And again, all the things can happen there, right? Sound effect, yay. Or, you know, whatever it is you want to trigger when that happens. Then at that point, um, Uh, no. In the other enemy manager thing, there's a separate thing for that. Also, you could um I thought I built that into enemy script, but remind me on Wednesday. We'll do it on Wednesday. Um, if you want the enemy itself to have more than one, right? Because when we shot it, it just, you know, one shot and it was done. But if you wanted it to have to take more damage, but uh, we're good there. But, but we need but we can tell that because we're looking at the number. We need the player to be able to know something about this information. And so back to our uh",
    "transcript_segment": "There we go. Okay, that's good. Landon Landon helped us out there. Picked the low hanging fruit. Uh, and so now, uh, Adrian, what do I need to do here? >> That's very good. Once you touch it, you get increase in health. >> Okay. And so, how do I get how am I going to know? Shut up. Spam. How am I going to know if Oh my gosh. >> Yeah, man. Okay. Um Yeah. Yeah. Zoe. So, how how am I going to be able to know if I touch this green box? >> Zoe. Zoe, >> I need to add add a new script. >> Yeah, trigger zone. >> Handles all. In the first, I won't do this anymore after this, but in the other ones, we had on trigger enter and on trigger exit as separate things. Now, that's all in trigger zone. just your one-stopes one-stop shop for triggering. And so here, okay. And so we do want to know if we came in contact with the player, right? And now Amy, what's next? Right. We've got this. It's a trigger. We've got this. Is this configured correctly? Right. We want this thing to give our give us more health. And so who who are we looking to make contact with? The player. The player, right? And so this is correct, right? The default here is that it goes to player, right? Um and so when we enter here, um Jack, who do we want to talk to? >> This is the box. This is the first a box. >> You talk to the health manager. It's like it's like the player has health insurance. Like like you want to make the player better, you don't talk to them. You talk to their health insurance and then negotiate. >> Anyway, >> nice to ask. >> I mean, there's got to be like satirical health insurance games on Steam, right? I haven't really looked at that, but like Yeah, don't get me started. Okay, so uh yeah, the health manager here uh we want to heal int and we will he 20 And then what else do we want to do here? Probably. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like get rid, you know. So you can't just keep healing yourself here. And so this will be first aid. All right. This is good. I get the feeling you guys are understanding like like I made this big thing that has a lot of possibilities. The good news is there's a lot of possibilities. The bad news is, right, you guys getting the getting the the trope of my of my education here, right? Um, the Yeah. And so we need to clean this up. We need to clean up first aid and say game object set active off. Okay. And we need to look here. All right. And so our current health is 20. If we pick this one up, actually we need to make sure that our we're starting off with 20. We need to make is higher than that so that we see a change in the number and then go from there. And so now there we go. And if we pick this up, there we go. We picked it up. And we are healthier. Cool. Uh, great. Okay. And so, uh, your game will probably have a few of these I might start to that you'll need to, you know, be interfacing with on a regular basis. And so, I might make a managers um, box and then start to accumulate my managers in there like so. And again, all the things can happen there, right? Sound effect, yay. Or, you know, whatever it is you want to trigger when that happens. Then at that point, um, Uh, no. In the other enemy manager thing, there's a separate thing for that. Also, you could um I thought I built that into enemy script, but remind me on Wednesday. We'll do it on Wednesday. Um, if you want the enemy itself to have more than one, right? Because when we shot it, it just, you know, one shot and it was done. But if you wanted it to have to take more damage, but uh, we're good there. But, but we need but we can tell that because we're looking at the number. We need the player to be able to know something about this information. And so back to our uh"

I'm going to make a new canvas. and then make a new game UI manager and reset that. Move it under managers and then put the UI manager on it and Actually, I think it might be easier to do this. Let's try this. Okay. So, in up here, in addition to the documentation generator, there's an examples and there's a few scripts that run like setup things here where they generate a bunch of objects in edit mode. Okay. And so one of those here is um generate game managers example. And here you see this does a bunch of stuff for us. Uh right away it makes a canvas. It has a bunch of things here. I'm gonna disable for now some of the other stuff that we're not talking about and just worry about the game UI. Uh this sets up a bunch of things to start with. So the game UI manager is the thing that is important here and you'll see this is a pretty big lots of parameters thing but it's the important thing to understand here is that we have a bunch of managers. So um health score collection right? So if part of your game is grabbing coins or whatever uh or uh whatever and the design pattern I tried to adhere to is that these just manage the data, right? And so they're incrementing the health or decrementing the health depending on what happens. They're giving you more coins or taking away coins depending on what happens, but they're not displaying the information that that was separated out into the uh UI here so that there wasn't this confusing what I thought was a confusing situation of like, oh, this this one has UI and this one doesn't and it just seemed inconsistent. And so this is this is the overall design plan is that you have these managers. You can opt into them whether you want the characters scoring in the game or not. Some of you it may be irrelevant to score more points, right? Um or some of you is doing more of a puzzle thing. The player doesn't get hurt. They're just solving the puzzles. So um but they do need to have some kind of like UI, right? So all these things. So this is separated out but the UI manager has a lot of configuring here. And so in order to see what it does running the example configuration here and yeah this error that it gives you is just about some of the things being populated here. But if we were to look at this let's look at a few things here. So, for instance, uh the UI here, you get to opt in or opt out of each of these things, right? Do I want to see the score? Do I want to see the health bar? Do I want to see the health score up here? And so, for right now, we don't want to show the timer. We don't need to show the inventory. We don't need to show the score. Let's see. And I'm just going to turn this off over here. Okay, now this is talking to our health manager, but let's just make sure that they can see each other if I remember correctly here. Um, this should be finding the other thing by default. If we hit play here and we just start. No, we're not. This didn't get our new information. It's linked to this. It's linked to this. It's linked to this. That's all there. That's there. Okay, that's forwarding our information, but it's not updating our bar. Why isn't updating the bar? It should be updating the bar. So the thing that links these two together right here, health display, right? So this is looking for uh text mesh pro object, which is part of the things that's sort of created in our general HUD here. I should make this into a prefab. Um um I don't think so. I'll go back and look at the code. I thought these were in general the rule is uh we shouldn't have a bunch. Certainly there's only going to be one UI manager. Uh and so we don't want that happening for a bunch of them. And so they were designed to like sort of like find each other, but the we're linking the text with this one. So this knows that this is the text for it over here that's being managed over here, right? And so this is the text before it. Um, and now if we hit play, upon play, this one will update. There we go. So that's our current amount of health. If we were to grab this. There we go. We get more and then we get less. And we're dead. Okay. And then but the bar is not updating. Let me add that to my list of stuff with the projectile and the bar and try and get those updated. But two separate situations, right? So like this thing is managing all of the UI and this is actually managing the health. The collection and the score manage or managers are very similar structures, right? We have this thing that sits there. When you pick up coins or you do something, you add to the score, the score gets updated up here. If you have it showing uh the score for all of this and making sure you're turning the score on up here. Uh and then you could increment the score in the same way. So, same idea. We got this manager. You're talking to the manager and then the manager is talking to the actual display of the thing up here. These are configurable and I'll try and see why they're not updating. They should be updating automatically as that changes because yeah, I I didn't want you to have to like set it up on that kind of granular level for this thing. just sort of like yeah we have this and then that works and they can go from there.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 10, 2025 Puzzle Switch System good. Okay, that's pretty good. Um, let's look at this for a second. Uh, what do we have left here? The Okay, so we're able to have health, have score, turn things on and off, have dialogue. Let's look at the puzzle. One possible puzzle implementation here. Um, I'm going to leave those alone for the sec time being. Let's turn this off. And so under puzzle, there's puzzle switch and puzzle switch checker. And so this is primarily like our logic of what's happening here in a puzzle. And that there's going to be a bunch of things that need to be in a specific state in order for the puzzle to be unlocked, right? And then what happens when it's unlocked is up to you, right? probably opening a door or like uh a bridge falls down uh you know like a draw bridge or something like that. Um and so if we were to look at this here, let's go ahead and create an empty and then go from here. And so we'll call this puzzle checker. And again, this is just kind of like an abstract thing. And let's put the checker on there. And so up here we have our switch targets. And so if we unfold, notice the structure I tried to keep the same, right? Like for the spawner, here's a list of things at the beginning. And you can expand that to as many as you want. And then at the end, you know, something happens based on all of this stuff. Um, and so this is particular in that it requires a an object that has, you know, like these two are designed to work together, the puzzle switch checker and the puzzle switch. And so let's get a puzzle switch happening that we can populate in here. So Here's a thing. We'll call this switch. We will put the puzzle switch on it. And it gets a name, the number of states, right? And so we'll keep it simple for right now, just on and off. Um, its current state and cycling. And here we can do some different things to it. So, let's give it two different colors um with materials. And under our materials here and when we turn it on, is it going to go automatically to zero? Yeah. Okay. So, it goes to this one by default. And so, you know, when it's in state one, it has this one. When it's in state two, it has this one. Right? Keep it simple with just two states for now. Um, then we have something like on state changed on activated other um events over here. So, let's be able to change this. And so, again, we'll add a trigger zone here. And I'm going to make this bigger. And make sure it says trigger. And we're looking at the player. And so now when let's save. When we enter this, we want to talk to this switch and the puzzle switch here. Uh we can go to next state. So again, state being like is the light switch down or up, right? Uh and so if we say next state there, again, we're talking to oursel. Let's just test that. I have this set to trigger. I have this talking to the right one. Yeah, we have it saying next state We are saying current state. We are saying to cycle the state. There we go. There we go. There we go. and see if it's just an issue with the function or with the whole thing because that's at zero. There's one. Okay, that was fine. Let's just try one other thing here. So there's up this there's the state rotations. Let's say that we do this. Okay. Something weird there. That should be doing it because we are doing the render. It does switch when I just set the state. Here we do this. Actually, let's try that. No, I didn't do it either. For right now, we'll do this just to get to the next part. So, we'll just set it to one. So, this will essentially flip our switch from red to green. There we go. So, this is one switch and we want to be able to send it the next state. So, that just toggles again. But for right now, we're just turning it on. Uh, and so this is one switch and you need to have a switch talk to multiple uh multiple switches talk to one switch checker. And so our puzzle checker here, that's what goes up here. How many of these need to be in their proper position? Whatever the position is, right? We're just doing this obvious super simple version where like they turn green, it's good. But it could be something that's much more cryptic depending on the environment, right? How you expose them to the player, how they are available to be manipulated. Anyways, um we're going to say this needs to be in one. And over here, put that in there. And let's make this at least three different things. And so we'll uh add two of these here. And so there's three switches that need to happen over here. We'll duplicate this. So control D. Move this over. Crl D. Move this over. Okay. And so now we have this switch and this switch. And then we have the switch checker. And so over here, let's put this one in. And let's put this one in. And uh automatic checking is on by default. So that like every time it gets a new state message, it automatically like Wait, was that right? Uh yeah, I think we want that on all the time. and how many are correct and then whether or not we solved and so if all of them get to one then we have this and so the nice part here or what I'm trying to have be the nice part is that this is a expandable number of switches right uh of varying complexity and this will look for all of them together and so let's get some sort of uh object here that would be obvious So, like for instance, this thing, like let's say that this is like a bridge that goes to the next part of the game, and we can't get there until uh we solve this puzzle. And so, we'll move this down like so. There we go. And then we'll just simply turn this off. And this we'll call this bridge. And then, uh we want to turn the bridge on if we solve the puzzle, right? And so, we go to the puzzle checker. We come over here to on puzzle solved. And who do we want to talk to? We want to talk to the bridge which is here to here. And we just simply want to turn this on for now. It could be a more elegant thing if it like animates up into place something like that. Um and set active. Yes. Okay. So, we have some sort of feedback um that the puzzle checker should provide. And yeah, I'm mostly going to fix this this issue of like are we going to start is state is the first state going to be state one or state zero? We'll try and I'll try and make that standard because it's a little bit unclear from the way it's worked out right now. Um and if we look here, switch ID, number of states, current states, Okay. And we've populated that. These are all red. And so we should be able to turn them on. So over here, on on, and on. And our bridge is there. And now we can proceed on with the game. Obviously making it um the making green the on again these are arbitrary decisions I'm just trying to make it obvious as to how it functions right you could have a series of symbols or something where you're like there's you know there's some sort of thing in the game that shows you like oh the symbols mean need to be in this order or in that order and then you know once you hit that correct version right the correct version is going to be defined in the puzzle checker which is like what are the correct states right if I make the which one's two is that the one over here yes okay so we'll make this correct one uh off that right and so now we shouldn't see the bridge unless we get green green red right and so Now, if we were to do that here, green, green. There we go. And so now that's when the bridge shows up because we got the correct version of green, green, red rather than green, green, green. And so now I can proceed on to the next zone. Right? So, especially if you're doing this puzzle thing where it's it's a good design idea to sort of section off the puzzles so that you're not trying to think about what if someone halfsolves this puzzle and then you like like that makes it difficult to, you know, like have doors are usually a great way to do this, right? like when you enter the new area, the door closes behind you and then you've got to solve the puzzle to get the next door open so you can manage the player limit the number of possibilities that are going to be happening here within that specific area. And so, uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not sure why that one function is not flipping the switch yet, but I'll look at that. But the rest of it makes sense here, right? Once that's in place, um now again they could be um in the switch itself are number of states is going to be the thing that could add a lot more complexity to it. Right? Even if you have like this is where you get into that exponential complexity of puzzles, right? If each there's three triggers and they each have three states, then you're at you know nine possible uh configurations, right? and setting that at some level where it's important for the player to sort of like figure it out versus just sort of like brute force try all of them, right? Um like how can you motivate that kind of behavior, right? And in addition to just changing the materials, right? There's a it's sending you know this is happening each time you get separate events for each state. So there could be a different animation that happens for each one all that business. Yes. Um, yeah. I mean, I think it would make a good idea to start. I mean, I would start at zero. Uh, but yeah, I I think starting off like numbering them would probably be the way to go depending on how complex it's going to get, you know, but something something along those lines, right? Uh, so the player knows so you know which is which here at the beginning. But then yeah, I would put all of these under one game object so that then I could, you know, easily know where everything is and manage it then at that point. Does that make sense for everybody? What's going on there with that? So that the simple again I tried to think of a simple mechanism that could be uh expanded a whole bunch here. And so, um, this I thought was a good version of that. And there's just some reason why that one function there is not sending the next thing. But we have a reasonable faximile there. So there could be, you know, there's two different ways to do this. You could have it be next state, right? Where every time you enter, it's stepping to whatever the next one is, right? Or you could have, you know, things that you need to move into different states. So for instance here, uh, let's say we have to turn, hold on, let's go ahead and make this back to one. But here with this one, this is not something we touch. Let's say that our puzzle solving um another frequently used thing is that instead of like directly manipulating the switch, you need to um use uh an environmental object and you know put it in the right place, right? the um you know like a Indiana Jones style thing. You need to put each you have these set of things. You need to put them in in a specific place. So for instance, we need you know something that we're going to put in the right place here. So let's just grab a cube for now. And we'll make this a little bit bigger. We will tag it as um key one. Remember this is just making the tag and then you need to assign the tag here. Okay. And we'll give it some sort of color.",

How you expose them to the player, how they are available to be manipulated. Anyways, um we're going to say this needs to be in one. And over here, put that in there. And let's make this at least three different things. And so we'll uh add two of these here. And so there's three switches that need to happen over here. We'll duplicate this. So control D. Move this over. Crl D. Move this over. Okay. And so now we have this switch and this switch. And then we have the switch checker. And so over here, let's put this one in. And let's put this one in. And uh automatic checking is on by default. So that like every time it gets a new state message, it automatically like Wait, was that right? Uh yeah, I think we want that on all the time. and how many are correct and then whether or not we solved and so if all of them get to one then we have this and so the nice part here or what I'm trying to have be the nice part is that this is a expandable number of switches right uh of varying complexity and this will look for all of them together and so let's get some sort of uh object here that would be obvious So, like for instance, this thing, like let's say that this is like a bridge that goes to the next part of the game, and we can't get there until uh we solve this puzzle. And so, we'll move this down like so. There we go. And then we'll just simply turn this off. And this we'll call this bridge. And then, uh we want to turn the bridge on if we solve the puzzle, right? And so, we go to the puzzle checker. We come over here to on puzzle solved. And who do we want to talk to? We want to talk to the bridge which is here to here. And we just simply want to turn this on for now. It could be a more elegant thing if it like animates up into place something like that. Um and set active. Yes. Okay. So, we have some sort of feedback um that the puzzle checker should provide. And yeah, I'm mostly going to fix this this issue of like are we going to start is state is the first state going to be state one or state zero? We'll try and I'll try and make that standard because it's a little bit unclear from the way it's worked out right now. Um and if we look here, switch ID, number of states, current states, Okay. And we've populated that. These are all red. And so we should be able to turn them on. So over here, on on, and on. And our bridge is there. And now we can proceed on with the game. Obviously making it um the making green the on again these are arbitrary decisions I'm just trying to make it obvious as to how it functions right you could have a series of symbols or something where you're like there's you know there's some sort of thing in the game that shows you like oh the symbols mean need to be in this order or in that order and then you know once you hit that correct version right the correct version is going to be defined in the puzzle checker which is like what are the correct states right if I make the which one's two is that the one over here yes okay so we'll make this correct one uh off that right and so now we shouldn't see the bridge unless we get green green red right and so Now, if we were to do that here, green, green. There we go. And so now that's when the bridge shows up because we got the correct version of green, green, red rather than green, green, green. And so now I can proceed on to the next zone. Right? So, especially if you're doing this puzzle thing where it's it's a good design idea to sort of section off the puzzles so that you're not trying to think about what if someone halfsolves this puzzle and then you like like that makes it difficult to, you know, like have doors are usually a great way to do this, right? like when you enter the new area, the door closes behind you and then you've got to solve the puzzle to get the next door open so you can manage the player limit the number of possibilities that are going to be happening here within that specific area. And so, uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not sure why that one function is not flipping the switch yet, but I'll look at that. But the rest of it makes sense here, right? Once that's in place, um now again they could be um in the switch itself are number of states is going to be the thing that could add a lot more complexity to it. Right? Even if you have like this is where you get into that exponential complexity of puzzles, right? If each there's three triggers and they each have three states, then you're at you know nine possible uh configurations, right? and setting that at some level where it's important for the player to sort of like figure it out versus just sort of like brute force try all of them, right? Um like how can you motivate that kind of behavior, right? And in addition to just changing the materials, right? There's a it's sending you know this is happening each time you get separate events for each state. So there could be a different animation that happens for each one all that business. Yes. Um, yeah. I mean, I think it would make a good idea to start. I mean, I would start at zero. Uh, but yeah, I I think starting off like numbering them would probably be the way to go depending on how complex it's going to get, you know, but something something along those lines, right? Uh, so the player knows so you know which is which here at the beginning. But then yeah, I would put all of these under one game object so that then I could, you know, easily know where everything is and manage it then at that point. Does that make sense for everybody? What's going on there with that? So that the simple again I tried to think of a simple mechanism that could be uh expanded a whole bunch here. And so, um, this I thought was a good version of that. And there's just some reason why that one function there is not sending the next thing. But we have a reasonable faximile there. So there could be, you know, there's two different ways to do this. You could have it be next state, right? Where every time you enter, it's stepping to whatever the next one is, right? Or you could have, you know, things that you need to move into different states. So for instance here, uh, let's say we have to turn, hold on, let's go ahead and make this back to one. But here with this one, this is not something we touch. Let's say that our puzzle solving um another frequently used thing is that instead of like directly manipulating the switch, you need to um use uh an environmental object and you know put it in the right place, right? the um you know like a Indiana Jones style thing. You need to put each you have these set of things. You need to put them in in a specific place. So for instance, we need you know something that we're going to put in the right place here. So let's just grab a cube for now. And we'll make this a little bit bigger. We will tag it as um key one. Remember this is just making the tag and then you need to assign the tag here. Okay. And we'll give it some sort of color."

Having watched all of the seasons of Lego Masters now I know not to say Legos. Lego is the plural of Legos. Lego. Um the And so I've tried to design like medium sized modular things as you're working. Uh, I mean, I've designed things that I think you now that I've explained how they work, you're capable of putting them together in all sorts of new and different ways. You know, again, different patterns. But it makes sense for you to then uh create what we'll call higher level modules where you if you're going to use this pattern over and over and over again, it makes sense for you to group all of that together into a prefab that you can then reuse over and over, right? based on those parts. And so, for instance, that's exactly what I did here with the trigger zone prefab, right? I just reused it quickly here so that I had, you know, like a reasonable size zone that I could just throw in there and then immediately hook up to something else in the game to be able to set stuff. So yeah, that um allows for all of those kind of things to to happen there, right? Um once you have an enemy correctly configured with all the things hooked up, then you're able to talk to that, right? The spawn once you have the spawner hooked up, you know, like there's probably different spawner prefabs here like like I made, right? I had the one that's sort of just spawning random junk. the one that's used to make stairs that you could, you know, sort of the Minecraft style one and then the like the shooty one for like shooting projectiles into the scene, right? Different configuration. Like I made one lower level thing, the spawner, and then by reconfiguring it and hooking it up to other things, you made the next level up of useful tool to make the entire system. It's that the whole way down, right? Like my things are built on next level down is C. That's not the end. C gets gets evaluated or compiled into machine code. Um and then there's another step down where the machine code goes into pure binary, the zeros and ones that are just being shifted around all the registers in the computer, right? And so it's just a chain of functionality there built on top of each other. You know, the level of specificity, the number of possibilities grows as you get closer and closer to the thing, but then also the level of complexity grows enormously, right? Like if you're just manipulating binary, you could do anything with a computer, but you would the complexity of doing that is uh crazy, right? Like no one besides the people who like made the original computers, right? Like no one is working at that level. Very few people are, right? because the the technical implementation of that is conceptually very different than how you actually think about the game functioning, right? In terms of like opening doors and like using keys and stuff like that, right? Translating that into machine code is very abstract. And when you're working on the, you know, designing the actual game experience, it's much better to be working at a level that doesn't require a ton of complexity of it and abstraction. Like how much complexity and abstraction do you want? Just enough to be able to get to whatever it is that you're doing there. Okay. So, all right. We got through a lot more than I thought we would there, right? A lot of different ways to spawn. I mean, this covers, I think, like 90% of a lot of different plans everybody has for the game. I'll look at the projectile space thing, why the health bar was not updating in quite the right way, and then that toggle state didn't seem to send the correct thing. But let me look at those. Okay.

We've moved the camera before, but I just kind of glossed over it and I said, \"Don't do this.\" So let's talk some more about exactly what to do or what there is to do. Um in general I would say three things. One do not always move the camera again. Super easy for us. much much harder in real life. This is where that limitation helps. Um, use linear key frames when you are using the camera mostly. There's some exceptions but keep those in mind. Uh and then what we'll try to talk about today is um I think it's better especially at first year to mimic uh IRL camera rigs or you know the physical nature of the real camera as opposed to not being connected to that in any way. So, three guiding principles here, especially with the music video. I mean the camera movement is going to provide a lot of energy but that doesn't mean that every shot needs to be moving especially I would say there's a balance here between um we can there's only so much the eye and the brain can parse per shot and so you need to balance balance the edit speed or edit pace with the actual, you know, camera movement. If you're moving the camera super quickly and you are um also cutting between things very very very quickly, all of this creates, you know, a lot of visual discontinuity and it's hard for the brain to lock into what's happening here. Um the other thing is that if you are moving the camera for instance here, um motion blur in most cases with the camera movement is something that you want to have on. Now in the Blender editor while you're working, it gives you that weird halo, or at least it sometimes does. Um because this is another situation where in real life you don't get to opt out of this, right? If you turn the camera really if you bump the camera at all, you're essentially, you know, part of what makes it hard to visually parse is that everything gets really blurred because you know to the to the frame or to the sensor to the film it's moving and then things get you know motion blur not on account of them moving on account of the camera moving. So yeah, um I would encourage you to be conservative here. Most student projects once they start exploring this definitely push this past the point of intelligibility where you know we have all the strobe stuff going on and things are happening really really fast and it makes it very very tough to parse what's actually happening. So um yeah okay",

Now in the Blender editor while you're working, it gives you that weird halo, or at least it sometimes does. Um because this is another situation where in real life you don't get to opt out of this, right? If you turn the camera really if you bump the camera at all, you're essentially, you know, part of what makes it hard to visually parse is that everything gets really blurred because you know to the to the frame or to the sensor to the film it's moving and then things get you know motion blur not on account of them moving on account of the camera moving. So yeah, um I would encourage you to be conservative here. Most student projects once they start exploring this definitely push this past the point of intelligibility where you know we have all the strobe stuff going on and things are happening really really fast and it makes it very very tough to parse what's actually happening. So um yeah okay"

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 10, 2025 Pan and Tilt Fundamentals three good um guidelines there. Let's just look at just general pan and tilt first. So again, this goes to principle or guideline number three there. Mimic the real world camera, right? Um what if we put it on a tripod and we weren't moving said tripod, but we're just able to tilt or pan said tripod. So, let's just do something like this here. And then I'll just grab this camera. Look through it. And I'm going to go ahead and lock this here. There we go. And let's move in a little bit. And let me go ahead and label this camera pan. And we'll go ahead and do one of these so we can see what's happening from the top up here. And the big thing to know, anytime we're rotating in this direction on this plane, that's going to be panning. And lot most of the time when you see this, it's slow as we're using this way to sort of like reveal some sort of larger scene uh progressively. And let's set something like that up. And in this case, we're just going to be animating the the camera set here, the Z rotation of the camera. And just in general with key framing and then in this case in particular, you know, you can always press the record button. uh that can lead to setting of all the transform key frames which just makes wrangling the editor a little bit more laborious and then also um can make it hard to reposition the camera but keep the motion that you have in this case like what if I want to move it but also keep the panning motion. So here, move this back to there. And then say we'll come over here. And then we'll just pan over to this sphere like so. Like so. There we go. And come down here and press grab the camera and press I. and only selected channels. And so that will just give us those two. So here, linear key frames. How would I choose whether or not this is going to be linear? Most of the time, I would switch this to linear because we're going to cut from here to here. And so if there were, you know, knowing that this is going to get combined and there's going to be an edit here and there's an edit there, you don't want to make it seem like we're slowing down into the edit. Um, right? This is that situation we talked about where it can be convenient to like set up the cameras and the camera's movements and edit between the cameras all in Blender at the same time to a point, right? uh versus if you're doing it the quoteunquote inconvenient way, which is only just like a few more clicks and rendering out each shot independently, you're kind of less likely to do that. Um, so I would say in a situation like this, we'll call this pan tight edit. And so in this case, um, yeah, I would right click these and set these to linear. And so now, as we got here to here, this would cut to some other edit. Something else coming in here. Another I'm going to go ahead and save these file, save as. and boop. Okay. And then duplicate this. Let's look through this one. And this one I'll say pan with padding. And so in this case, um, this is a shot where we want to hold here for a while, then pan, then hold here. And so it's going to look something more like this. Move these key frames over. So we've got this time and this time. So in this case here, we would want to ease in and ease out because without the easing in and ease out, we have this It just looks like a really crappy camera operator, right? Um, so if we're going to see the camera stop, we definitely want to ease into it. You know, there's a whole lot of physical engineering that goes into realw world easing, right? Um, just in terms of panning, not even like moving the camera, just rotating the playhead, right? even, you know, like mediumriced tripods have all of these uh really sort of well-gineered um mechanisms that allow you to dial in just the right amount of tension for moving the camera around so that you can do this super smoothly in real life. um you know much less you know setting up track and moving it around just just panning or or tilting. Um and so in this case we would want to ease in and ease out of this. So let's go bezier. Let's look at the uh graph editor real quick and say select this and turn that on. Oops. Stop that. Uh grab this. Normalize. There we go. And now we have this. So we're looking at this. Then we turn around and look at that. In my experience, students really underestimate this amount of time. Okay. In order for this to for this easing not to seem like an erroneous mislication of this where you're you just didn't think about it and everything is still set to ease. You need to let the you know the the the movie the film come to rest in both of these. We're looking and we're looking right. um editing too close to this uh is going to make it seem like a mistake versus something that was intentional. In all of the cases with the music video here, um we're going to be rendering out these separate shots and then putting it together in the timeline. Like maybe you do a little bit, like I said, of part of a sequence in the Blender edit workflow that we talked about before, but I don't recommend doing the entire thing that way. It's going to be just you're going to spend most of your time fighting the workflow because it's not quite as smoothed out as one would hope yet. And um the padding here I would say as a rule of thumb more padding not less. You can always cut this down. Right? We're, like I said before, animation tends to be more additive because especially in small teams, you don't really have a lot of time to make a whole bunch of stuff you're never going to use as opposed to filming a real world thing where you you it's not at all unusual to film stuff that just gets totally cut from the film or the movie or the TV show or the music video. Um, but here when we're talking about rendering, you know, I don't know, 20, 30, 40 more frames, maybe 20 on each side, right? 24 on each side. That gives you an extra second to work with in either direction. Um, that's going to be not a huge amount of extra render time, and it also gives you a lot more flexibility when it comes to edit all the stuff together and keeping it in time with the music. So, um, yeah, when you're setting up each of these shots, making sure things are, uh, have some extra room on each side. So, if we were to look at these here, the tight edit where we're going to cut from here to here, right? And so in this instance, you're editing before the end of the shot, right? And and then in this instance here, we are wanting to see the camera start and stop. And so in this case, easing would be okay. Knowing that you can come in and dial the handles, which one is it in Blender? Is it control is going to keep it from uh deviating from the is locking the bezier handle otherwise you can get into this kind of situation right which is important to remember if there's another key frame down here where you're overshooting not in a good way what is going to happen there again that just looks like crappy camera animation uh cap camera operation in that it went one one way and then the other. Okay, that's good. Uh, let's come back to the tight edit one and copy and paste that one and",

Again, the motion blur, even on these slower pans, as it moves from one place to the other, is essential. Even if you're using a stylized, you know, not photographic technique, most of the time you're want to it makes sense stylistically to do this. Um, right. So there, not like a super fast pan, but still you can see like the trails and the lights and everything as we turn from one to the other. See one part of the royal tenon bombs here. Let's get that happening over here. So even in these cases, let's come to our padding one in here and There is. Didn't we turn this off at some point and then turn it back on? The motion blur in the editor view. I mean, I would just leave it off. I think it makes more sense to see. I mean, because it was the way the only way you could see it before, I'm kind of used to just looking at it this way. You know, having to render something to get an idea of what's going on with the motion blur. And so, you know, like the length of the trails, the amount of blur that's happening here is going to be a function of, you know, how fast we're moving the camera and, you know, the motion blur settings. But mostly, it's going to be, you know, our camera settings here. Let's go ahead and create some more stuff. And I'm going to put this over in this case faster. So the play blast thing that we had gone down that road before up here. Um I don't think this Let's try it. Yeah, it's just in the viewport. Okay. Yeah, because it was even hard to tell there whether it was just the choppy playback or so this the play blast up here is just going to give you like an even rougher interpolation or interpretation of what the motion blur would be versus the actual proper you know output thing. So in this case to get quicker quicker idea of what using this box you know make it that much smaller and then outputting something faster. The other issue here and you may noticed this watching, you know, television at home is that this kind of camera movement. Um, there's what we're trying there's the image you're trying to make digitally here and then there's also this other level of representation we're not even addressing here, which is like when the movie is compressed and then played back. Uh, there's the compression that's happening and doing something like this is um the hardest thing for the compressor to handle, right? The compressor just tries to cheat and just like looks at the frame and then it looks at the frames before it and it says like which of these pixels have changed. I only want to try and store the information about the new things changing, right? But when you move the camera like this, all the pixels change, right? And so there's um it's fighting the compressor. You may have seen this right during these panning shots. It looks like it's like kind of like chunking. Even in the theater, like I've seen this when they the like really quoteunquote high quality compression that they use for digital playback in some theaters, you would get the same kind of thing where it looks like it doesn't handle the tracking very well. So here we are. Yeah. So, even here that was like 20%. Or maybe 40, whatever I set it to. But definitely enough to get a flavor for what the motion puller is going to feel like here going from one to the other. So, super necessary for those kind of panning shots. Angie's there. Uh, good.

If we look at the next one here, uh, whip pan as if the, you know, we're looking through the eyes of the camera and then we are, um, you're looking through someone's eyes and they're turning their head very, very quickly. Um, so this, you know, we're really emphasizing the motion blur as things go back and forth. A lot of these, you know, here in this La La Land scene, they're doing it quoteunquote for real, moving the camera like this. But in a lot of other, you know, shows, in a lot of other instances, this can be faked where we just sort of filmed one scene, then we filmed the other scene, and, you know, we just make it seem like we're whipping from one to the other. A big part of making this kind of shot work, and you saw it in both the La La Land one and here, is you got to have some sort of like specular content in between the two things. It sort of gave you some way to sort of track which direction you're going and what's happening. And so here, whatever is going on with the um lights here in between on both of these. You see they set that up and we're seeing that blur by in both in all the instances. So let's set something like that up with the velocity. So some easing here again is going to make it, you know, just a tiny bit to get it to ease in and ease out of each position. And so here, let's get this one happening. Uh, I'm going to grab the key frames that are here and move them over and then move them in. Make sure we're looking through this camera. Even less. Let's try about 10 frames at first. Pretty good. Let's ease these And then let's look out of the camera and set up some of the things we're talking about. There we go. And if we look at this now from here to there, but then use the same principle. Let's make some bright things. So, we'll just do this for now. and put something on those. Right. And even in the approximation there, we can see if I can even get the let's just look at the camera right there. So, as we're scrubbing, we can kind of get the idea. And then we could just send this one out to just check in and see what's going on there. I mean, because it's so perfect here, I might, you know, we're getting these like perfectly straight lines here with this. Um, doing something to make it per perhaps a little bit less precise here. So, let's go ahead and look at this. Setting some maybe just a little bit of offset here and perhaps just ever so slightly there. And so that gives us two values. Come over to here. And again some sort of let's make sure that we can set this and something there. All right. All right. And so now we just don't get those perfectly parallel to the frame. And let's see if there's anything we can do with our motion blur settings to make it a little bit more organic. So the length of our shutter is going to obviously spread it out or slow it down. We get a little bit more differentiation in the beginning and end here. You know, making this something that's not if it's uh light reflecting off of something that's going to be more inconsistent. Um all those kind of things there. So, but it does gives us something to at least sort of track our place in space. Um, if we were to look at this, let's render less time there to here and control F12. And so if we look at that one We get our whip pan. I mean, that's pretty short. I would say that's on the, you know, shorter end. I'm not sure I'd go much faster than that. Remember, you're kind of referencing something where like someone has to actually physically move the camera. So, um, let's look at one other way to do this in comp. And so I'll give it a little bit more time here. Did that get all the key frames? Yeah. Uh so to do it on comp here, we would say uh no motion blur and render that out. So, in After Effects, uh, we'll bring it in here. And so, I have no motion blur. And I'm going to use a directional blur in After Effects to try and simulate this. And so, this would be similar to the technique you would use with a little bit of, you know, transform to totally fake it, right? if it wasn't actually turning, if it's just cutting between one thing and the next thing. But with this fake um whip pan, let's look at that. So in here, Okay. So here um our directional blur would be one for this. And so with this selected, double click adds that. And so if we start blurring, you can see what's happening here. But we only want it for the period of time that we're whip panning. And so right about here, I'd set a key frame. Or actually, let's do it in the middle because that's where we're at. I mean, right about here. Set a key frame. Now back it up and zero. Yeah, I don't want to do the direction. I just want to do the amount. And then back down to zero. and then checking out these key frames. So, let's come in here to the f-curve editor, select this, select this, and we get our After Effects default linear. Uh probably put some curves on this to make sure we have a little bit more time at the maximum blur. And here we could adjust this by bumping this up. So another option right um if wrangling the motion blur is being you know like if you have it one set one setting here and then you have to change the motion blur to kind of get the kind that you want in the middle and you have to have different motion blur setting. Then at that point makes a lot of sense to do something like this where you can just control this later in comp. You could even um put a levels in here uh to be able to adjust what's going on. So if you set a key frame there, let's do this. And then back to the same key frames here, right? Allows you to get the you know, whites to pop more as it's going from one one to the other there. So, whipping. Let's look at",
    "transcript_segment": "this. If we look at the next one here, uh, whip pan as if the, you know, we're looking through the eyes of the camera and then we are, um, you're looking through someone's eyes and they're turning their head very, very quickly. Um, so this, you know, we're really emphasizing the motion blur as things go back and forth. A lot of these, you know, here in this La La Land scene, they're doing it quoteunquote for real, moving the camera like this. But in a lot of other, you know, shows, in a lot of other instances, this can be faked where we just sort of filmed one scene, then we filmed the other scene, and, you know, we just make it seem like we're whipping from one to the other. A big part of making this kind of shot work, and you saw it in both the La La Land one and here, is you got to have some sort of like specular content in between the two things.

Let's make some bright things. So, we'll just do this for now. and put something on those. Right. And even in the approximation there, we can see if I can even get the let's just look at the camera right there. So, as we're scrubbing, we can kind of get the idea. And then we could just send this one out to just check in and see what's going on there. I mean, because it's so perfect here, I might, you know, we're getting these like perfectly straight lines here with this. Um, doing something to make it per perhaps a little bit less precise here. So, let's go ahead and look at this. Setting some maybe just a little bit of offset here and perhaps just ever so slightly there. And so that gives us two values. Come over to here. And again some sort of let's make sure that we can set this and something there. All right. All right. And so now we just don't get those perfectly parallel to the frame. And let's see if there's anything we can do with our motion blur settings to make it a little bit more organic. So the length of our shutter is going to obviously spread it out or slow it down. We get a little bit more differentiation in the beginning and end here. You know, making this something that's not if it's uh light reflecting off of something that's going to be more inconsistent. Um all those kind of things there. So, but it does gives us something to at least sort of track our place in space. Um, if we were to look at this, let's render less time there to here and control F12. And so if we look at that one We get our whip pan. I mean, that's pretty short. I would say that's on the, you know, shorter end. I'm not sure I'd go much faster than that. Remember, you're kind of referencing something where like someone has to actually physically move the camera. So, um, let's look at one other way to do this in comp. And so I'll give it a little bit more time here. Did that get all the key frames? Yeah. Uh so to do it on comp here, we would say uh no motion blur and render that out. So, in After Effects, uh, we'll bring it in here. And so, I have no motion blur. And I'm going to use a directional blur in After Effects to try and simulate this. And so, this would be similar to the technique you would use with a little bit of, you know, transform to totally fake it, right? if it wasn't actually turning, if it's just cutting between one thing and the next thing. But with this fake um whip pan, let's look at that. So in here, Okay. So here um our directional blur would be one for this. And so with this selected, double click adds that. And so if we start blurring, you can see what's happening here. But we only want it for the period of time that we're whip panning. And so right about here, I'd set a key frame. Or actually, let's do it in the middle because that's where we're at. I mean, right about here. Set a key frame. Now back it up and zero. Yeah, I don't want to do the direction. I just want to do the amount. And then back down to zero. and then checking out these key frames. So, let's come in here to the f-curve editor, select this, select this, and we get our After Effects default linear. Uh probably put some curves on this to make sure we have a little bit more time at the maximum blur. And here we could adjust this by bumping this up. So another option right um if wrangling the motion blur is being you know like if you have it one set one setting here and then you have to change the motion blur to kind of get the kind that you want in the middle and you have to have different motion blur setting. Then at that point makes a lot of sense to do something like this where you can just control this later in comp. You could even um put a levels in here uh to be able to adjust what's going on. So if you set a key frame there, let's do this. And then back to the same key frames here, right? Allows you to get the you know, whites to pop more as it's going from one one to the other there. So, whipping. Let's look at"

When we're which axis am I rotating on? Think of like a pin going through the object then rotating around the pin. So, in Blender, that's Z for any sort of panning. And then here, tilting. Anytime we're going to go up or down with the camera. And so, in Blender, this is going to be like the Y axis of what's happening there. Um, a lot of times this that shot is a lot of what we're doing with tilting. We're making something look much bigger and intimidating by kind of looking up at it. Or we're making you we're looking at something that's really tall and we're coming down to look at it. And these other kind of tilts, you know, like we're just sort of like moving the camera slightly, rotating it slightly for these massive shots. But a lot of times this has to do with the the scale of everything, right? Right. The giant title wave and interstellar so big it can't even fit in the frame. Right? So we have to like look up to to we have to tilt up to look at it. And then once this starts happening in um inception again, we're communicating the scale of whatever this is. It's been a long time since I watched that. Um let's do one of those over here. And so I'll make uh another new camera. And this is going to be camera tilt. And let's uh look through said camera. There we go. and camera to view. And here I'm going to open this up a little bit. Maybe five and try and communicate the scale of this, you know, like giant character. And so in here in here we want to be doing this on the X. Right? So the combination of things here. The focal length contributes in that we're going to get this um expansion of space with this lower number here, right? To make um that'll make it seem bigger as well, right? the thing is big that we need this um wider angle in order to do that. And that's going to be distorting the perspective even more. And so over here, over here, and let's go ahead and this over here. And again, same kind of thing. If this is going to be if we're going to be cutting in, editing in, editing out, then I think it's important to make this linear so that we could see that. That's pretty quick. I would say that's on the low end of what would be actually visible. This is the other thing. As you're working on this, I would encourage you to error on the side of the shots being too long rather than too short. Your, you know, how many times are you going to watch this music video while you're putting it together? Somewhere between a million and a billion, right? And so your understanding of the temporal part of it gets really skewed after a while unless you're taking proper breaks and you know stepping away resetting your brain and then coming back and able to actually digest it um naturally. Uh but if you're working for 36 hours straight right before the deadline that goes out the window and you're just sort of you know like it gets very compressed. And so, uh, thinking about the even if it the pace the edit seems sluggish to you, like you really got to get some other feedback about that. So, both those things, the focal length and the tilt there. So, this is tilt big thing. Okay. And then like another um take on this. What if we got rid of these? And let's make an actual even larger thing. More like the other tenant bomb shot. So we had some even larger thing with like some sort of There we go. Some kind of obelisk looking thing here. And look through. Oops. Again, the low angle here could help. And and yeah, communicating the largest of this thing. Let's try it in the other direction. So, here we've got uh this one. There we go. And key frame here. And then let's bring it down here. Again, if we want to see the beginning and end of this, same rules as before. Now, if we're going to have this and this in the shot, some sort of padding, then we want to um ease in and ease out of those And there's enough time on both ends of the shot to sort of digest what it is that we're looking at. Cool. So, anytime we're going left or right, that's panning. Anytime we're going up and down, that's tilting. Um, but we've got this um you know cinematic language of this you know tilting up revealing the large thing. We got the cinn cinematic language of the you know whip pan or very quickly turning our head from one to the other. There's a lot of room for experimentation with the whip pan because this is not how how we function right like your eyes you are getting motion blur but like your the thing you see is such a composite uh in your brain of what's happening like you turn your head but your eyes move instantaneously and so like it's more of the this is I think part of what makes first-person video games like really tough for some is like the camera is locked here as opposed to turn your head and looking with your eyes which is a different kind of experience.

    "video_id": "lehX0JK6g48",
    "search_text": "AVC240 November 10, 2025 Push In Camera Movement let's go to some more fun stuff. So over here uh yeah pushing in. So this is definitely what you know we just sort of like ad hoc uh added to some of our shots earlier because this is pretty low technical um barrier strate. you know, a really good strategy for making the footage more dramatic in that this sort of slow push in is a really just solid way to increase interest, build tension, direct the focus of the viewer on something. Um, and so a lot most of the time here I, you know, I would say if I had to ballpark it, a lot of these shots are going to be of the variety where we are editing in and editing out of it. We're not doing a lot of pushins where we see the camera start and stop. you know, like for a pan because of the way it goes across a specific view, um, you see more of that. Okay, this one we're seeing the camera start there in this, you know, communicating the moment of realization, right? Um, for what's happening with the character, that was a much longer shot than a lot of the other ones. Let's make another camera. and let's come over here. And are we looking through that one? We are. And here we're animating the position, right? Um especially in the digital environment here there's some room um in terms of how we want to implement this because again making these sort of fine adjustments is not is not too difficult. So, for instance, if we just wanted to do it quoteunquote strict, just like uh real world style, right? We're going to be doing the location on the y here. And so that moves forward. Um actually here, this is going to be world space conditions. In order to do this correctly, we would do it over here. And in this case, right, we're moving the camera, you know, exactly in this direction. And so selecting the camera, making sure we see the gizmos here, and making sure this is set to local so that we can move directly on the Z-axis, right? Because so this would be call this camera push in IRL strict where we just go directly in that direction. But even though we're going in this direction, we're still moving, you know, our coordinates are being recorded in world space. And so we've got to set all three here and then uh at the end just move it forward. But because we're moving at some, you know, angle there, we're not move, you know, like not everything is not lined up to the Z-axis, I can't just set one um key frame there. And so now I can set these and we have this to this and we get this very slow push in. In this case, like I said, most of the time this is not you're not seeing the beginning and end of it. And so the linear key frames are absolutely necessary here. So again, we haven't done anything to the animation of this just walking bot, but just by changing the camera movement here, we kind of get different vibes off of this one walking animation here versus, you know, sort of tilting up the whip pan a little bit funnier. uh over here. Dramatic push in on what's happening. And the other possibility here is that um yeah, for doing this in real life, again, you're not zooming. So, it's not a dial on the camera like the zoom is going to be for the lens. So all sorts of different um you know physical ways of pulling this off for smaller camera rigs. Now a lot of people use this kind of thing where the camera is small enough to fit on this and you have like these mini tracks that you can set up. It's really cool. Easy to much easier to set up and tear down. Um, occasionally, you know, there's things where you put the tripod on wheels in general, unless you're like in the world's in the room with the world's most smooth floor. This is not going to work uh to the point where it's not going to make the footage all uh jittery. uh a lot of the stuff where we're putting it on the tracks. Even in this one, notice that the the rollers, you know, it's like two four sets of wheels per each, you know, arm of it. There's a lot going on there. Um we have bigger versions where we get more and more um space. You know, here we're sitting on it. The whole thing is there. This is on track. That's going like this. This is all getting wildly more expensive. Um, as we go on here, uh, you know, if you wanted to, you know, again, for us, set a key frame, set a key frame, set a key frame, and you're doing this, you know, in real life, you're doing something like this, right? Where you got to have this curved track and everything moving around. Um, yeah, you know, like, do you have 25 $100 25 uh, yeah, $2,500 to spend on curved track? We have a lot of the stuff next door. Not a ton, but some. Um, so it requires a lot of intentional setup, which is why a lot of this was reserved for these really like dramatic moments in the film. Like we're going to, you know, really, we can't have this happening all the time. And so we need to reserve it for the moments that really um matter, right? This would be one of the roles of an onset producer. Someone is being like, \"No, we don't have enough money to spend to move the camera on this shot. We can move it on this shot, this shot, and this shot.\" Right? So, uh, yeah. And then there's, um, making sure the whole thing is level so that it doesn't accidentally speed up or slow down over the course of the shot. Takes a lot of time to get all this set up. the other, you know, versions of this. Um, you know, there's a been just in in my life, there's been like a huge, uh, um, advance in all sorts of stabilizer stuff. Uh, where you can do some of this by not having to set up all the track and just sort of walk around. Um, and so depending on how big the camera system is, you know, there's all of these, you know, essentially stabilization and, uh, movement control kind of things, big vest systems that have these quasi mechanical arms that you're just kind of, you know, controlling and moving around. Um, let's look here. What else? Where's our all sorts of more miniature versions of these? Have you guys seen these kind of things? Like now we have versions where it's just like tiny thing on a stick. I have one of these for my um phone, right? Um that you know to some extent you know depending on how you know good your balance is and how in shape you are you can pull some of these moves off just by being able to walk fairly fairly softly and you carry this stuff around because it's really able to uh absorb a lot of the movement. I mean, it's never as easy as it sounds, though. Like, every every time, you know, myself or someone else tries to, you like, \"Oh, we can just use the Osmo to do this thing.\" And then you do it and you're like, \"H, not quite.\" Um, you know, it still requires quite a bit of practice to get it happening. But, um, yeah, all of this stuff is crazy. I mean, a lot of it uses the same kind of like accelerometer data that's being used in the phone. um or in cameras that have that sort of motion control on them. And yeah, if you're using like a DSLR or anything like this, then you know, doing this kind of control controlled shot is pretty um it's way more accessible than it used to be, right? It used to be definitely talking about track and all this other stuff and now there's all these other cool options. So, uh so you see a lot more of this now, right? And there isn't like the IRL stuff is a lot more uh close to what's happening here. And so here for instance like we've we this was you know just completely strict. And let's give it a little bit more action here. And so I'll shift D or control CRV this. And let's look through this one. And we'll call this one push ination. And here uh yeah, let's see. I'm going to in addition to the Let's go ahead and get rid of these key frames. And it's still going to be primarily a push in, but we'll give it a little bit of turn to it as well. And so now I'm not going to be so concerned with moving directly in line with whatever the camera is. And so I can switch this back to global here. And if I move this around over here, let's say it's going to be kind of there. And so I'll set key frames all throughout there. Um, and then when we come forward here, let's u move forward. and then also rotate a little bit in this direction. And so again, making sure since we're not coming to rest here, uh, that we are linear. And so now we're still primarily pushing in, but we're getting a little bit of this slight movement at the same time. Right? So, uh, yeah, in real life, this is, you know, requires managing both things at the same time, which, you know, could be a little bit easier, but, you know, still primarily pushing in, but allowing us to really just sort of tweak the framing of what's happening in perhaps a little bit more of an interesting way, right? A lot of the older movie pushins that were showing there were like the camera moving directly forward because it was being uh you know this means to do this you have to have the track going in one way and you're moving that way and then you're also rotating with the um tripod while it's moving on the dolly. You know, all of it not, you know, not probably not the first take. Cool. Let's save that. Let's look over here. Okay. Uh back to here. Just like with the tilt, you know, we can go in the other direction here. Most of the time narratively, we're, you know, like revealing the scope of something. Um, we're starting with something and then revealing, you know, how much other stuff there is or what what what uh narrative device is actually being uh revealed throughout the entire thing. Uh, So you can definitely see there with that shot, right? Like it's not directly in that direction. We're moving a little bit at the same time. Hard to say. You a lot of these may be people with steady cams moving the camera. And a lot of times a book end, you know, like, oh, we're seeing the whole the whole thing. So the dolly zoom. Um,",

Um that you know to some extent you know depending on how you know good your balance is and how in shape you are you can pull some of these moves off just by being able to walk fairly fairly softly and you carry this stuff around because it's really able to uh absorb a lot of the movement. I mean, it's never as easy as it sounds, though. Like, every every time, you know, myself or someone else tries to, you like, \"Oh, we can just use the Osmo to do this thing.\" And then you do it and you're like, \"H, not quite.\" Um, you know, it still requires quite a bit of practice to get it happening. But, um, yeah, all of this stuff is crazy. I mean, a lot of it uses the same kind of like accelerometer data that's being used in the phone. um or in cameras that have that sort of motion control on them. And yeah, if you're using like a DSLR or anything like this, then you know, doing this kind of control controlled shot is pretty um it's way more accessible than it used to be, right? It used to be definitely talking about track and all this other stuff and now there's all these other cool options. So, uh so you see a lot more of this now, right? And there isn't like the IRL stuff is a lot more uh close to what's happening here. And so here for instance like we've we this was you know just completely strict. And let's give it a little bit more action here. And so I'll shift D or control CRV this. And let's look through this one. And we'll call this one push ination. And here uh yeah, let's see. I'm going to in addition to the Let's go ahead and get rid of these key frames. And it's still going to be primarily a push in, but we'll give it a little bit of turn to it as well. And so now I'm not going to be so concerned with moving directly in line with whatever the camera is. And so I can switch this back to global here. And if I move this around over here, let's say it's going to be kind of there. And so I'll set key frames all throughout there. Um, and then when we come forward here, let's u move forward. and then also rotate a little bit in this direction. And so again, making sure since we're not coming to rest here, uh, that we are linear. And so now we're still primarily pushing in, but we're getting a little bit of this slight movement at the same time. Right? So, uh, yeah, in real life, this is, you know, requires managing both things at the same time, which, you know, could be a little bit easier, but, you know, still primarily pushing in, but allowing us to really just sort of tweak the framing of what's happening in perhaps a little bit more of an interesting way, right? A lot of the older movie pushins that were showing there were like the camera moving directly forward because it was being uh you know this means to do this you have to have the track going in one way and you're moving that way and then you're also rotating with the um tripod while it's moving on the dolly. You know, all of it not, you know, not probably not the first take. Cool. Let's save that. Let's look over here. Okay. Uh back to here. Just like with the tilt, you know, we can go in the other direction here. Most of the time narratively, we're, you know, like revealing the scope of something. Um, we're starting with something and then revealing, you know, how much other stuff there is or what what what uh narrative device is actually being uh revealed throughout the entire thing. Uh, So you can definitely see there with that shot, right? Like it's not directly in that direction. We're moving a little bit at the same time. Hard to say. You a lot of these may be people with steady cams moving the camera. And a lot of times a book end, you know, like, oh, we're seeing the whole the whole thing. So the dolly zoom. Um,"

Uh and everybody understands now that you know the zoom how the zoom is qualitatively different than pushing in or pulling out with the camera. Right? Pushing in or pulling out is not going to communicate this difference in how space is portrayed. Whereas if we using the zoom that is absolutely going to happen, right? Because it's part of the way the uh camera functions there. So the zoom here is definitely you know I feel like this is culturally informed a little bit by not just narrative film making but you know documentary slashjournalism where you know something's happening live and you know the camera the you you can't get closer or can't get closer in time and so they're just zooming in on something and so definitely a lot of times we're enga you know like unless it's some sort of super slow uh zoom in on Jack Nicholson like we have here like um we're doing this sort of like out of necessity in order to you know get a closer look at something especially yeah our crash zoom here where a lot of the same kind of thing as what was going on with the whip pan right knowing that you're going to get this compression and expansion of space there. So, let's look at the crash zoom. I'm going to go ahead and make another new camera. And let's look through this camera. There we go. and here. Okay, right about there. Uh, a lot of times here we may need to like most of the action is going to be in animating what what parameter is going to get animated here for a crash zoom focal length, right? But um in order to frame this shot well and frame the closeup well, chances are you may need some rotational key frames here as well. And so let's start off with that. Uh let's get some rotation key frames. Not those, just those. And then let's come in here and uh get a key frame here on this. And then very quickly, let's zoom in a bunch and set a key frame there. And come back and make some adjustments here. Shift key is your friend to be able to Oops. There we go. And your easing in and easing out here, I would say are going to be usable. We want to have those there. And let's see what our motion blur is doing for us here. So, I might move some of this stuff over here. Again, having something like this, it's gonna allow us to see that arc of what's happening. And let's see what happens over here with uh this and yeah, so similar to what's going on with the um whip pan, we're able to see that happen. Let's just get a short one here and dial this one in. And I'll control F12 that And let's see what that looks like. Yeah. So, super in your face literally in this case, right? Um, and yeah, like the zoom here works. Again, you could spend some time wrangling, you know, our motion blur settings or do this in comp. And so over here, uh, if we were to do this in comp, again, I'm doing the super low res versions of these. It just rendered really quickly. Okay. And so here, um, the what's it called again? Yeah, the radial blur has a separate mode for zoom. There we go. And so here uh yeah so in After Effects radial blur um has either this spin for you know like I mean this would be a thing too right if you tilted the camera real quick like it would also create this spinning but like that's not that doesn't happen very often um versus uh zoom and then the amount don't you can really amp this up here. And so even, you know, like I didn't render one without it, but if we were to just start right about here. And so the amount uh actually like in the middle of it right there. I'm going to go ahead and key frame then move back to the beginning and and then right about here. Put that back at. And if we were to look at that curve again, we get one of these again. Might do one of these just to even that out. Maybe make it a little bit greater. Right? As soon as you ease the handles there. Now, right, you get and if you want to dial this up even more, right, because even there like, oh, that looks like a lot, but you remember this is happening. It's going to be that amount for like one frame, right? And so, yeah, that's a bit much. I don't know, maybe a slightly less. The other issue here is right, it doesn't line up exactly with the motion blur. And so the center, anytime you have uh a two-dimensional parameter in After Effects, you get one of these target things. And so if you click on that, you can reenter where you know like the zoom is coming out of, right? And so that makes it seem to fight a little bit less with what was happening with the motion blur. Again, it's not as it's not doing the same kind of calculation, but it's happening really quickly. So, you know, like the you can make that work. If you wanted to make sure it wasn't conf conflicting, then render it without motion blur and just do it here. Um, which would work especially for situations where it's sped up. So, zoom uh yeah, our uh crash zoom in comp. We talked about the dolly zoom a lot before I mean, yeah, not everybody needs to use the dolly zoom in their music video, right? So, like is is it warranted? Um definitely a little cliche. Um",

So a lot of times uh unless you do something very specific, this is going to be something uh a lot we see it a lot from this angle, especially now uh because we've got so many drone shots in all these things where making the drone spin around like this is uh pretty easy, you know, like a lot of times it's actually unavoidable, you know, depending on what it is. Um, and so, oh yeah, this is recognize this one. This is this might be four or six. I can't remember. >> What's that? This is when six through the rest of them just kind of runs together into like this you know like fever dream of cars and sweat and muscles. Um where you know whereas up to five they have like a little bit more of a you know discernible narrative to them. You know, after that it just becomes like this, you know, at one point someone jumps a car between two um skyscrapers like from one like the 47th floor of one to like the 24th floor of another. Stuff like that happens like and you don't even think about it. You're like, \"Oh yeah, yeah, sure. I guess you could do that.\" And that thing. Yeah. So, you've seen this before in a bunch of commercials where the camera like spins with uh the thing that's moving in order to make it seem like uh like the camera's attached there. So when So when uh Dwayne Johnson smashes Jason Staithm through that glass table, it's as if the camera is attached to Jason Staithm as he gets smashed through or Jason Staithm's stunt double as he gets smashed through the uh glass plate there. And yeah, unless it's this aerial shot where things are sort of rotating very very very quickly, um or very very slowly rather, um this is almost always communicating some like real disorientation for what's going on. The famous Black Panther shot there when uh Kilmonger takes the throne, you know, shows that everything is upside down. The shot at the end of the Dark Knight where he's just kind of hanging around. But yeah, this one uh that the you know the power structure has been inverted and so yeah, not a whole lot of this kind of thing in quoteunquote, you know, like regular cinema. We do see a lot of this kind of stuff, you know, because music videos are more of a home for experimental techniques the whole time, right? A lot of music videos originally just, you know, here's some people, some stuff, some camera. I don't know. Let's try some things. See what happens. because you just you can make it work later on. Um but over here similar kind of camera roll situation camera. And because you know like as if we're doing you know like the drone shot thing. I'm going to get this out of the way here. It's a little tall now. Like so. Uh I'm going to grab the focal length for this. and uh dial this down a little bit. And same kind of thing. So, primarily we're going to be doing this. And so, how we're rotating and what's at the middle matters. This may be in order to not have it seem, you know, quoteunquote, you know, like off-kilter, this may be one that would warrant having the point at constraint. And so if we pointed at the armature with the correct pointing axis, there we go. Now, when we do the rotation, it'll seem a little more centered on there. So that makes that a little bit easier. And you don't need to sort of like key frame all these other things to compensate for it. Um, and turn that on and come over here and do something like this. And key frame that. And again, we'll be cutting in and out of this almost 100%. This isn't the kind of thing where like you're going to be able to like slow it down in a lot of these instances. That's a lot of rot that that seems fast to me in this instance. So again, I would try to, you know, first time through here rely on the energy of what we're seeing, not the camera movement to sort of build the energy of the project. Um, and so slowing these down a little bit might be the way to go here. Let's just say just about that much. So now again coming in here and saying there we go that feels more digestible. Yeah. So this is definitely an instance where, you know, when I started teaching these classes 12 years ago here at GCC, you know, I could tell students like you can't have the camera flying around like crazy because it's like not something you can do in reality. And now like that, you know, computer technology is leeched back into the camera drone technology and now like yeah, you can totally do that, right? Uh in terms of like flying something through a space like this. Um I'm sure well I don't know like you see those things on Instagram or Tik Tok of like these like ridiculous drone shots of people navigating in and out of things. Um, there's that one that went around for a while, that bowling alley. Do you guys see the bowling alley one where it like goes through the entire bowling alley and then goes in uh under the where the pins are and then flies through the back area uh behind the pins and then comes back out the other direction. It was great. It was amazing. Yeah. I mean, the drone camera stuff is just, you know, mind baffling. mindboggling. And then there's the, you know, uh I see it on those HGTV shows all the time or like influencer videos where they're like, \"Look at me. I'm on vacation.\" And like it starts off close and then like zooms like it pulls way out because it was like a drone that was hovering here and then they speed it up as it goes off in the other direction, right?

We won't need to make that much of a change, but um you'll see how this works. So this is a good uh skill in general to sort of understand the sort of time ramping um sort of goes beyond camera movement but allows you to make some like quotequote impossible camera movements in terms of uh remapping things. So for instance, uh a couple things here."

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 10, 2025 Time Remapping in After Effects Uh if you want time remapping in After Effects and we have to uh rightclick and enable on this per track and then you'll get a um parameter which is allows you to uh key frame name the essentially playhead position on that clip. So that's there. Let's look at the clip as it is now, which is here. Yeah, it's already pretty fast, but you know, we'll we'll change it here. Now, going faster is going to be fine because uh you're interpolating between information, you're compressing the information. Going the other way, super slow-mo. If you want to have some super slow-mo stuff, the probably simplest way is to just take all your key frames in Blender, stretch them out, and render something that's super slow, right? We'll do that next. Um, but here with this one, if I come back to After Effects and bring in this shot here, uh, with this There we go. And we'll make a new comp from the selection. There we go. And we're zooming out. And we want that to happen even faster. Um, we need to rightclick and we go to time, enable time remapping. That gives us this. Okay. And so this uh represents the progression of time. And so if you come over here, you have you have to do this in graph editor mode. And so this is just uh regular speed. Okay. In order to uh speed up the whole clip, you would take this key frame and move it this way. And so you're covering the same, you know, zero seconds to however long this clip is, 3 point something seconds in less than three real world seconds. Okay? But um it's a laborious a confusing way if all you want to do is speed it up or slow it down. You do timer mapping if you need to animate or change the speed at which it's happening. And so here you come in and set some control-click to get some more key frames. And now we can do something where we take part of it. And if I create a sharper slope there or steeper slope, it's just this part of it is running faster. And then it gets back to about regular speed there. And so if we look at that and see where does it start moving? Right there. And so I'm going to take that and put it there. And then take both of these and move this in even more. And so we're here up to there. Um it depends here with the easing, you know, how quickly. Like if this is actually the length of the shot, that's probably pretty fine. You notice that we do get some of the motion blur. You may want to do some of the tricks that we just did before, right? Where maybe like some zoom blur here while this is happening depending on how long it is, that kind of thing. I mean, this kind of shot is always manipulated, so there's some room for experimentation here. Um, sometimes it works to uh ease these transitions. Uh, but here what not always. Look at it. That's really fast. Um, so it's barely able to see, but you see it really kind of eases into that last position there. But in this case, pretty it seems to like clunk a little bit less there at the end. But this is a really fast shot. So this is one way to do this. Uh and yeah, we see, you know, the character actually speed up walking, right? So we're seeing the time manipulation happening there. So if you want to do this kind of stuff, like this is definitely in post, right? Trying to like speed up and slow down the entire scene key frames in Blender would in most instances be like a pretty big hassle. Whereas here, you just have this one parameter to take care of. So, there's that. If you just need to speed something up or slow it down. Okay. So, here, like just this shot, uh, right click and time time stretch. And so, this is just the bulk speed up or slow down parameter. And so again, um 50 is shorter and 200 is. And so going to 50 here. If we were to look at this actually uh right click and let me control- Z once. Okay. So now, right click, time, uh, time stretch. Watch the timeline. Boom. It's half as long. And so now the whole thing is faster. Compressing. There's not going to be any frame rate issues. the frame rate like you sped up the frame rate of this clip, but at the end of the day when the film when it gets exported from After Effects, you're still exporting 24 frames per second or I still have my timeline set to 30. Whatever the comp timeline is is what you're exporting. Okay, the issue, like I said, slow-mo stretch out your blender key frames so that you're rendering slow motion. Doing the opposite results in not a good um visual, right? Right. If I go to time time stretch and make it if I like want to make it 400. And so now if I watched it, I'm just seeing the individual frames. By default, it doesn't do anything to create any stuff in between. The best way to do it is in Blender and render more frames. There are two things you can do here that are not as good um by clicking this parameter here. And so in After Effects, this is called frame blending. And when you stretch something, it's like what is After Effects going to do? And by default, it does nothing. It just it's pure animation. I'm going to show this frame longer. Then I'm going to show this frame longer. End of story. But uh this parameter right there is frame blending. And the first one is just simply that icon. And now it's simply just going to fade as if they were like PowerPoint slides and just fading between each one. And in some cases that's fine. you know, it always gives you like this ghosty kind of look because you're just fading between the frames. And yeah, I mean, in a pinch, it's fine. The second one is where you can get into trouble. And this is what do they call this again? This is they have a name for this pixel something. Oh, this is pixel motion blur. This one right here. This I don't know. I guess that icon's okay. I don't know. the three arrows, three dots, and then an arrow, and then three more dots. Uh, and so now it's going to try to create more frames in between the other frames. Um, and so a lot of times this is, uh, sometimes you can get lucky and it can make some super slow-mo stuff. when it it's more complicated stuff and it's, you know, you can see with the hand there as always like anytime you're animating hands, you're putting hands on screen, hands are not easy, right? A lot of complicated stuff going on in the hand. And so like the automatic algorithm here is like doesn't really handle it well. But you see like for the general character and like the arms moving and stuff like that smooths it out pretty good. Um, so yeah, for quick solutions it works, but um, you know, far and away the best way to get high quality slow-mo will just be to stretch all all the key frames in Blender and render more frames than you think you need. Then you can smush it or time ramp it over here and it'll continue to look good. Um, and so those are those those are the options there. So, by default on a layer, it'll be nothing, meaning that it's just going to play the frames chunky style and then or fade between the frames like that or do the um pixel motion blur, which is seems like it's fast here in this one instance, but if you got a lot of effects and a bunch of other stuff going on, like it can uh it can be very slow for it to you know render out the pixel motion blur. So there's that. Okay. The",

And so being able to do something where there's some more uh give and take between the camera and the subject like it would be, you know, in every real life situation where, you know, it's actually a camera operator probably with a steady cam rig following uh the character through space. And so if we were to look at something like that, Okay, so this character is now walking and so let's save incremental and we'll do the timehonored animation uh timesaving technique of cropping out the character's feet so that we don't uh have to animate them and we can see the character just sort of bouncing through here. So for instance, let's animate this character and doing something like this here. Uh in this case, And the character's feet are not speeding up and slowing down. And so, uh, there we go. Especially for not having the feet not in the frame, that works. And so now uh yeah what we want to do is we want to track along with the character here. And so let's come in here. And this is one of those deals where I think being able to point at the character will be good, but um I want to have some more control over that versus having it locked to where it is. So constraints for this we're going to shift a and make a um empty plane axis and this will be the character position and this come out of the car camera for now. Uh, let's move this to about where the character is. And let's um because it's a character armature block going on there, instead of trying to make it like an actual child object, I'll use the constraint and say child of armature. And so now it should move along with it. So that's good. Now um we want something with some independence here. And so let's go ahead and shift a and make one. Or actually I'll control ctrl +v this or not the whole thing just here just the uh axis. No it's doing everything because it's constrained. Okay. So, I'll just make another empty and move this over and up. And this one is going to be our camera target. And I'm going to go ahead and shift drag this underneath camera position. And so in our actual tracking camera, uh, I'm going to have it point at this. And so let's actually make sure that those things are There's that. There's that. Okay, they're close enough. And so now tracking cam will damped track to this. There we go. And there we go. Okay. And so now let's move. Now we can move along with it. And so uh on the actual camera we just need position key frames not rotation. Rotation is being handled by the constraints. So here and let's move along with the character. And so G right about there and get those updated. So I'm able to move around with it. And now if I wanted to have a little bit more independence, I can come down here and do something here. And so here I can um you know set some key frames for this and then do what we talked about previously with our noise here. If we were to look at these, if we grab all of them and switch to our graph editor again, look at these and add a modifier noise. Remember, holding down uh alt allows us to adjust all of them at the same time, all three axes. And alt shift gives us tinier amounts. Actually, as soon as you press shift, does it undo it? There we go. There we go. And so depending on how much of this you would want, right? You can now grab each one and the phase kind of gives you different values so that they aren't all lined up. Right? So looks very handheld now, right? The amount of uh influence here, how smooth this would be a lot to do with the scale. And so spreading that out and then the strength, bringing that in. No, you can do alt and shift at the same time to get tiny little values changes. There we go. So that's much looser, right? It doesn't have the totally unrealistic thing of like there's only one instance in which like it looks like the camera is actually physically attached to things and that's like in those GoPro helmet cams, right? right where the camera actually is at, you know, like the head or whatever part of the thing rig is visible is like like locked in the frame. Um, and so here, yeah, we're able to track along with the character, but this is uh a setup that's going to be very very loose. And so we animate the camera completely separately. We use the uh damped track on the camera to point at the uh camera target, you know, which is being moved around by this um Yeah. And so this has the child of constraint. So if I changed the character speed at which they're moving, it would update through the system. And so that's a fairly flexible way to go about doing it. and ends up feeling really natural there. So again, those two constraints can you can get so much done with just those two, right?

Is there enough happening in frame to carry carry the action? Right? Um doesn't always the camera doesn't always need to be moving all time, right? Especially if you got, you know, dancing and stuff like that going on, right? That's a pretty visually active thing. And so, uh, is that going to be be enough to sort of make it work? And you know, is the pace of the camera movement going to work with the pace of the editing in what's happening here? Uh, and going back and forth. Sound good? Okay, good. Let's knock off a little bit early here. Um, so everyone can continue to work on your storyboards and style frames, right? And then yeah, the video from last Wednesday is up. That one actually got flagged uh and held by YouTube for the Spielberg clip where he was just talking about Ready Player One. like that was all that behind the-scenes making of documentary about Ready Player One was all copyrighted and protected to the point where that was the thing like not the, you know, because some of the bits of the music did slip out as I was like trying to wrangle all the volume sliders. Um, no problems with any of that. It was just that one Spielberg clip that his you know, entire movie making apparatus had in mind, but they make it pretty easy in that instance. I've had this happen once before, like I just had one button on YouTube where I could say, \"Yeah, just clip out that thing and then post it and it takes a little bit longer for it to get through the YouTube system then.\" But then that worked. So yeah, if you see that edit because I never edit any of the lectures that you'll know why there. But all the other stuff like where I played the like pretty longer clips from the imaginary forces things of like again not the thing just people talking about the thing. Um that was all fine. So that's all in the original thing and I also linked to all of those um different sources there if you want to watch the entire imaginary source uh imaginary forces. um thing and uh yeah, sound good. All right, look forward to seeing the style frames and the storyboards on Wednesday. See you then.",

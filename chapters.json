    "search_text": "AVC185 November 05, 2025 Student Feedback: Chair and Table Modeling >> Everybody, it's Bo here. Uh, this is my table and chair presentation in Blender and Subainer. So, we'll start with the chair. So, here's it in solid view. >> Pretty much just followed the tutorial that Casey gave us the in-class lesson. There's a wireframe. >> You can do like the split screen, so you can do both at the same time. It's nice. And then here's the UV editing for the chair. >> Um, the only differences I made was I split the center of I split the center of the center post. Um, but yeah, pretty much just kind of followed, you know, because it it unwrapped really nice. So, just, you know, kind of just did what Casey did for the chair. So, it packed up very good. Put in um the separation for that. And then on the table I made, so there's the table in solid view. Here's the table and wireframe. >> Mhm. Looks good. >> Very low poly. And then for the UV editing though, since the table does have bins at the bottom of the feet, the legs, so you're going to have that. Um, but and then I didn't rotate it when I scaled or did the UV unwrapping. And then for the table, how we UV unwrapped, I kind of did like what we did on the seat chair, but I also added in these corners so that the corners laid flat. There wasn't like any weird like wrapping. And then inside inside lines and feet and then inside of the uh extensions of the table and >> Yep. Exactly. Try to put the seams where you're not going to see them. >> And in painter, this is my nice chair as you saw in the screenshots. Um just made like a nice like cabin chair, you know, and I chose to make this grain go sideways just to kind of give it a little bit of a difference. Um, and then used the same grain of wood, you know, kind of like it was all like one piece, but maybe this was stained a little bit. And then I also made a a worn look or damaged. So once that loads up. Yeah, I just kind of destroyed it. Um, as Casey said, there's blood. I have a bloody handprint up here. Like, you know, somebody grabbed it. The wrong one. The wrong one. There we go. then put some scratches on. It's burnt. What I liked it really liked about that is uh here just labeled all the layers, you know, the put the gradient in there. You got a burn layer, scratches and cracks that put some cracks in the burnt kind of like how, you know, when it when wood is burnt, it does crack and like it turns to charcoal. And then for the table, we just made, you know, simple nice rustic table to go with the chair. Used a different um texture for the top. So the tabletop is just the texture and then I added the colors into the gradient so that way you know there wasn't a bunch of like different fill layers or anything like that and changed the roughness and then same thing for the frame. I chose this one for a trip planer cuz I think it looked a little bit better. The other one I didn't I just wanted to look kind of normal. And then running out of time. Here's the damage. Look. Yeah. Sorry, I had to do a little bit of editing cuz the self- sustainer crashed when I tried to open or make it look again. But here's the damage table. So, got some blood on this side of the table going down the leg. Some more burns. Uh, put some paint peel into the burn. So, I thought that came out pretty well. And then that person was here. Oh, yeah. It just kind of made it look a little bit worn. Uh, just around the edges, some scratches, stuff like that. Okay, great. Good job. Good job. For sure. You got the you're controlling what direction the wood grain goes and uh yeah, you definitely did some experimenting here um with our different techniques. The thing that's more successful with the burning here is it looks like the burn was combined with some uh height and I think that makes it work look the burns look more convincing here than they did on the chair. I'm not it didn't even if you were doing the same thing there just didn't seem to Yeah, they really don't seem to pop in the same way that the the burn part do the burn part does over here. Um, yeah. So, I'm not gonna look up a bunch of like blood splatter reference right now for obvious reasons, but yeah, that's not what blood splatter looks. I mean, like, you know, I've been fortunate enough not to be around like a lot of blood splattering. Um, you know, not that kind of doctor. So, um, yeah. I mean, it's just usually a lot darker and, you know, like the tone of the red is usually a lot darker than you kind of like envision it being. a lot of instances and a multiply blend mode is usually something that's going to give you more of like a realistic blood um you know on top of something whereas this looks more like you know like paint or something. Um and then yeah you're just being pretty heavy with the height detail here. Um, so wherever the grain height is, either using the levels or just using the general height strength in the height stack to dial this off a little bit because, you know, it's like past the point where it looks like wood. Um, you that could also be adjusted in the final render environment as well, right? So this is exported back to Blender. Then you can um you know this is going to be height going into a bump map and the bump map have a has a strength slider which you could back it off there. So uh yeah you can we'll export uh these over but yeah you got the right uh the right idea there for that. That's looking that's looking good. Um the yeah I think you sort of take it to the next level. This crack is a really good idea but again I think I would try to either maybe put that um anchor point that into some height information so the crack starts to you know like either it's being either it's going in or it's like lifted out a little bit. Something like that would help take it to the next level. The just general uh scale of the wood grain on the table strikes me as a little small, right? Especially with wood grain looking at some reference and considering how big the table is because we're just even if we, you know, I'm not a carpenter, but like we have like a we're round this stuff all the time. you kind of have a feel for like how big the grain pattern is compared to the scale of the object. It does a lot to communicate the scale. So the table ends up looking kind of like small because of the way the wood grain is like the like I feel like the tiling on the wood grain pattern needs to go up in order to make that work 100%. But you're hitting all you're hitting all the major things there. Making some good progress for sure.",

Now, first of all, for the spaceship, I didn't realize till today that I didn't submit it last week, so I didn't get any feedback on it. Um, and I tried to add like the little thruster beam, but for some reason it won't show up. Here is what the nodes look like. the volume doesn't work very well >> and that it wouldn't show up for you or that it was clunky >> weird and I didn't feel like fixing it because I did without it >> but It doesn't work very well with at least a small container. I think it's a scaling issue. >> Yeah. Uh she's not using noise. So like the noise isn't being there. Yeah. Without poking around in a lot of this. the from what I can tell you got things set up correctly. However, yeah, the actual density values to make it work. um if you just sort of worked along with me and plugged in all the nodes and then looked at it and it didn't work like you got to um with all this stuff disconnected. Does this show up as a volume? Uh that would be the first line of defense there. And then yeah, if I remember correctly, I did a bunch. Didn't I end up using a gradient? I think I used a gradient node in here to sort of map this into the right space at some point. Um, I think you might be missing that one. >> Like, um, I followed pretty much this exactly emission strength. Oh yeah, this is, you know, to get it to be emissive, I have this multiply on here and I think I ended up cranking that quite a ways in order to make it bright enough to see because depending if the light's not hitting it, then it's not going to look like much. >> I couldn't figure out >> and you you weren't cranking the emission so that's not going to cause it to emit its own light. get the multiply thing up because when I search it, >> it's math. You have to search for math like nothing shows up for that. >> Yeah, math. >> So, but other than that, like it just won't show anything for there. So, I'm not quite sure what's going on with that. And then here is my chair. Um, I think I did pretty good with the shape and everything. And then here are the UVs. Just select all of that. Those are the UV. >> Okay, that's that's pretty good. What the things you'd want to address here are you have this kind of stuff, right? So, this is all getting bunched up here because there's not enough seams on the top to lay this flat, right? So, you probably need a seam here, here, and here. Um, so that these don't get bunched up at the top and the bottom. Well, I'm not sure what piece this is. Same thing here. So, these parts where it comes together in a corner, think of it like a like a cardboard box that you would wrap stuff in and how where you would have to cut the box to have it lay flat. That's where you need a seam on the chair. If the chair were made of cardboard, where would I need to make the cardboard cuts in order to be able to lay it totally flat? Right? If I had a to if I had a a cardboard box that didn't have any seams in it, right? In order to lay it flat, where where would I have to cut, right? um because you're just not getting enough seams around the corners when the end of the the end of those square pieces because they're all pretty square should lay pretty flat on the UV mask. Here's what it looks like. Like that. And then here is my wood chair. I accidentally made the model sideways in Blender so it shows up sideways in Substance Painter. Here's a little up close look at the wood chair. Yep. You got some wood grain going on there. But then, you know, this because you you're using the default UV projection. You know, the wood grain is going straight across here. And so, you want to exert a little bit more control over this. Ideally, we want the wood grain going along the long parts. That's how something like this would be uh constructed usually. Um and here the wood grain is even like getting distorted because of these situations. Now the other fix here is just to change the layer projection wherever here change the layer projection to trip planer and then it'll sort of repro in object space and that'll fix the problem to an extent. uh it'll still be kind of pixelated at the ends because of the the way this is bunched up, right? So, trip planer kind of solves your problem, but not completely there. Uh the thing you'd want to do is go back and make a few more cuts in the UV to get these to lay flat like they did in the example and rotate the chair. And then you don't need to start over. You just need to go to project settings and import the improved FBX and all of the other stuff should u populate pretty well. >> And then >> and the high channel stuff here again um like like bows just just too strong. It just it may look like, you know, gritty here, but especially if this object is going to animate, like if the chair is going to fall over or if the camera's going to move, all of this like really sharp grit here in the height channel just ends up flickering a lot in the render. And so that just doesn't look all that great. that. And then here is the chipped paint chair. And then here is my table right there. >> Yeah, that's pretty good. You missed the uh detail here at the bottom with the tapered legs. >> And there's that all unwrapped. >> Okay. Uh okay. Well, this is better from the standpoint of things have unwrapped more flat, although you have a default cube laid on top of the UV map here. Uh, so that's confusing. I'm not sure where that's coming from, right? Because this is clearly the top and the bottom, and I don't know where that is. And here is an in wireframe view. >> Yep, that's my table. >> Did you make the legs as separate cubes maybe? And one of them didn't get unwrapped correctly. Yeah, I mean this just needs another pass for attention to detail. This kind of stuff at the bottom. And then yeah, something it looks like perhaps you did use the mirror modifier here, but then we either have too many edges. I can't quite tell. Or it wasn't you needed to turn up the merge distance to fuse those together. There >> my chairs. And then hopefully I can get some help with my rocket. Okay, thank you. >> Let me see. download it to see if I can get the thing to show up. That's Andre. Where's Crimson's table? Chair. Chair. Chair. He didn't send me the rocket.

Now, first of all, for the spaceship, I didn't realize till today that I didn't submit it last week, so I didn't get any feedback on it. Um, and I tried to add like the little thruster beam, but for some reason it won't show up. Here is what the nodes look like. the volume doesn't work very well >> and that it wouldn't show up for you or that it was clunky >> weird and I didn't feel like fixing it because I did without it >> but It doesn't work very well with at least a small container. I think it's a scaling issue. >> Yeah. Uh she's not using noise. So like the noise isn't being there. Yeah. Without poking around in a lot of this. the from what I can tell you got things set up correctly. However, yeah, the actual density values to make it work. um if you just sort of worked along with me and plugged in all the nodes and then looked at it and it didn't work like you got to um with all this stuff disconnected. Does this show up as a volume? Uh that would be the first line of defense there. And then yeah, if I remember correctly, I did a bunch. Didn't I end up using a gradient?

Okay, that's looking good. The It looks looks kind of puffy, right? And I think that's because you got shade smooth on there, but in the bevel modifier, you I mean, I'm not I can't quite see yet. You may not have checked that harden normals checkbox, which were something like this that we want to look fairly angular, you would want to check that box. And that's in the I think it's like the shading section of the bevel modifier. Okay. Yeah, you got the hardened normals here. Check and see if that's on that table. >> Good. So, Yeah. I mean, um, adding a seam here along the top, right? This may be this here. You may be on too many seams, right? Where you're just sort of spreading stuff apart that doesn't Yeah. Ideally, you want to have less seams rather than more. Yeah. >> Just reminded me. >> Oh, yeah. The one the one very very small black line. Yes. >> Yeah. I remembered how I fixed it in the past is you just for the for the object where you're lowing you just shade smooth everything. >> Okay. So it's a shading break that translates into that black line. >> Yeah. So those edges were marked as sharp. Ah, >> because that was one of the more sharp edges. >> But then so just shade everything smooth and then when you should fix that. >> Okay, make a note of that. So yeah, but here Isabelle, you're on like probably just have this seam, not this top one. And then maybe just there. Right? You don't need to break off each one of these parts there. You just need for this amount of curvature. Snipping it once so that then it could lay flat would do do the job. I mean, would everything lay flat if you just, you know, if you just selected all of the edges and made them all seam so that they're essentially then you just have like tiny squares you're just throwing onto the floor, right? and they would all lay flat on the floor, but you would have like this maximum number of seams. And so that um it's most that's mostly bad because like it makes texturing in UV space impossible at that point. And then additionally there is as far as I understand like a performance hit there in that jumping around the texture to read this really really shattered UV map does uh in video game contexts it it's something that might matter if there are a lot of the things I mean the you can find people I I just try to point you guys I mean I tried had to at least give you some guidance here about what is more work for the computer, what is less work for the computer, but how much more and how much less. The stuff that I'm pointing out is generally stuff that would be like a lot more work, right? Because in terms of like the the marginal improvements in performance is just a an area of constant debate on the internet. Um, and something may be more performant, but I mean I've I've read teen Unity threads where it's like, well, if you use this function instead of this function, if you run it three million times a frame, this one is 75% faster, right? And and like sure that's faster, but like I can't imagine the situation in which I would ever author anything where that function is being run three million times a frame. And so when we're talking about running it like less than one, a couple of times per frame, like you might be saving, we're talking about times well less than a millisecond, right? So, uh, you know, just fractional a lot of quoteunquote performance gains as the computers have gotten faster have sort of faded into the distance of computational um abundance in that there's the computers are so fast that things that used to matter just like in most instances don't matter as much. Right? Right? The reason all these people are getting hired to do all these big AI jobs uh for computer engineering is because that to train the models takes a tremendous amount of compute. So you are in a situation where you're running these algorithms uh literally a gabillion times. And so any sort of fractional improvement is worth zillions of dollars or something, you know, like all way beyond my ability to comprehend either computation or money. And so, um, it makes a big deal. But for us rendering a chair, you know, like it's really pretty marginal, right? The computer can render chairs. We're definitely into the, you know, chair future where we can reimagine the chair as much as we want, right? Cool.",
    "transcript_segment": "Pretty quiet. Let me see if I can get some more juice here. anything like your chair. Okay, that's looking good. The It looks looks kind of puffy, right? And I think that's because you got shade smooth on there, but in the bevel modifier, you I mean, I'm not I can't quite see yet. You may not have checked that harden normals checkbox, which were something like this that we want to look fairly angular, you would want to check that box. And that's in the I think it's like the shading section of the bevel modifier. Okay. Yeah, you got the hardened normals here. Check and see if that's on that table. >> Good. So, Yeah. I mean, um, adding a seam here along the top, right? This may be this here. You may be on too many seams, right? Where you're just sort of spreading stuff apart that doesn't Yeah. Ideally, you want to have less seams rather than more. Yeah. >> Just reminded me. >> Oh, yeah. The one the one very very small black line. Yes. >> Yeah. I remembered how I fixed it in the past is you just for the for the object where you're lowing you just shade smooth everything. >> Okay. So it's a shading break that translates into that black line. >> Yeah. So those edges were marked as sharp. Ah, >> because that was one of the more sharp edges. >> But then so just shade everything smooth and then when you should fix that. >> Okay, make a note of that. So yeah, but here Isabelle, you're on like probably just have this seam, not this top one. And then maybe just there. Right? You don't need to break off each one of these parts there. You just need for this amount of curvature. Snipping it once so that then it could lay flat would do do the job. I mean, would everything lay flat if you just, you know, if you just selected all of the edges and made them all seam so that they're essentially then you just have like tiny squares you're just throwing onto the floor, right? and they would all lay flat on the floor, but you would have like this maximum number of seams. And so that um it's most that's mostly bad because like it makes texturing in UV space impossible at that point. And then additionally there is as far as I understand like a performance hit there in that jumping around the texture to read this really really shattered UV map does uh in video game contexts it it's something that might matter if there are a lot of the things I mean the you can find people I I just try to point you guys I mean I tried had to at least give you some guidance here about what is more work for the computer, what is less work for the computer, but how much more and how much less. The stuff that I'm pointing out is generally stuff that would be like a lot more work, right? Because in terms of like the the marginal improvements in performance is just a an area of constant debate on the internet. Um, and something may be more performant, but I mean I've I've read teen Unity threads where it's like, well, if you use this function instead of this function, if you run it three million times a frame, this one is 75% faster, right? And and like sure that's faster, but like I can't imagine the situation in which I would ever author anything where that function is being run three million times a frame. And so when we're talking about running it like less than one, a couple of times per frame, like you might be saving, we're talking about times well less than a millisecond, right? So, uh, you know, just fractional a lot of quoteunquote performance gains as the computers have gotten faster have sort of faded into the distance of computational um abundance in that there's the computers are so fast that things that used to matter just like in most instances don't matter as much.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 05, 2025 Student Feedback: Wood Grain Scaling Nice. >> I just did both my table and my chair. I did the wood plane material. >> Yep. The wood plane looks really good. Uh because you got your UVs very well organized. >> Yeah, that looks good. I mean, the the way we modeled it doesn't really look like puffy seat, but you know, uh it looks fine. >> Yeah. So here like your your scaling of the wood grain looks great to my eye in that like this looks like the scale of a typical chair because you carefully scaled this wood grain to make sense with the relative size of the leg. Uh where it breaks down uh and where this comes up often is fabric. And so the underlying weave pattern is like the wood grain here and you want to get that scale correctly. And so the weave pattern here looks way too big in order to communicate. Not not the flirtily other pattern. Um although it looks like they may be baked in together in the same thing. So I I don't know. I thought this was a separate layer, but I'm not totally sure. So um yeah. And then over here, especially with this is the downside of doing this, having those too many seams there, is that in your case in particular where it would matter that it looked like a continuous piece of fabric that was wrapped around the top, which is, you know, as far as I understand, how upholstery is done, right? We want the the seams of the upholstery to be like, you know, underneath the couch or inside or, you know, that kind of stuff. And so that's where this the UV unwrapping would matter a little bit. You could um correct this to some extent by throwing these into what projection method are >> link. You can also try. >> Yes. But you could also have like you can use like sphere projection in a seam. >> Yeah, >> a little bit finicky, but it'll give stretching. >> A sphere would wrap around. It may look a little weird on this particular shape, but like Yeah, for sure. Um, but yeah, using you you haven't done anything and you're using the UV projection, which looks fine for the top face, but then we get this seam here, so it doesn't look like a continuous piece of fabric. And then because all of this got shattered into different pieces, then it looks like, you know, we glued pieces of fabric onto the corner there. But uh so yeah, the again the trip planer can cover up some of the um issues with UV unwrapping, right? They they make it such a prominent part of the substance painter interface design. substance because you know Adobe is trying to use the substance stuff as a way to get quote unquote regular designers into 3D and so of course you know Arinka being the exception everyone hates UV unwrapping and so the um especially regular designers trying to learn 3D and so they try to totally obuscate it they're like hey just do the automatic UVA wrapping then just throw everything in trip planer it'll be fine >> I Just want to add like nerd up a little bit. Trip planer projection is really cool in game design because in engine I'm not not sure unit probably also does it but you can use trip planet planer projection to generate materials. >> So you make different materials to make a rock material and you make like a moss material for example and then using some node magic it will project the moss on the top edges and Right. Right. Right. >> You don't have to manually paint it in every single time. >> Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Unity has a separate similar thing. You can do a similar thing in Blender. Um if you were to um organize stuff according to world coordinates, right? So like here uh uh and one of these not this one of these >> wall that I showed in the beginning the spiral wall. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> I use it on the landscape. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It works great for those kind of things. So if we put a material on the sphere, right? because the whole key is that we're just doing something oriented to the space of the world regardless of the space of the thing. And so, uh, I'm going to give this some sort of obvious color like that. And let's be able to see it like that. And then, uh, control T. There we go. Get my mapping nodes. And I want this. I just need a um gradient or ramp. There we go. Okay. And so here Gosh, I thought I remember for sure we had a world space thing over there. There we go. Okay. So, it's not in the texture coordinates node. It's in the geometry node. And so this position here, this is world space position. So if we were just were to look at um let's run this into the base color there. There we go. So remember our XYZ equals um RGB stuff. So here, check out what's happening. I'm rotating the object, but the colors stay put because the colors are being generated via world space. So, what direction is up in Blender? >> Z, right? And so, we need just the last one. What is that? Split here. Separate. Separate XYZ. There we go. And so here I'm going to grab just the Z and run it into this thing and give this let's leave it like that and do it like this and get rid of that. So now it's always white on top and black on bottom. No matter what I do to the rotation, no matter what I do to the scale, it's white on top and black on bottom. And so this is the kind of stuff that Arlinka was talking about. As long as we use world space information, right? This could be snow, right? And if we just made this look a little sharper here, like so. No matter what we do to this as we start to model this into, you know, a rock or something like we came in here in sculpt mode and then started turning this into uh something. There we go. Modeling it. Model. Model. M model. All right. no matter what happens and no matter what I do to this object, it's always um white on top and black on bottom. And so with some more shader magic here, we could make the white stick out more, add a grain to the white, and it would be snow. And no matter what it would look like, it' be there if it were uh and if we wanted it to be moss there, it's moss. Um right. And then just the positioning here would depend how much of this we want. And of course having a straight line all the time is not desirable. And so how do you break up a straight line? >> Noise. Yeah, exactly. So if we grab some noise here and we um let's see here. We want to keep the white but add the black. And so let's get this. Let's run this into We need to mix this with this or actually probably before this. So we need our mix. Uh we're going to mix floats here just black and white colors. And here, okay, there's just noise. There it's just gradient. Here's a mixture of noise and gradient. And so that sort of breaks up the edge there. And so now, no matter what, no matter where this goes, um it's always going to be on top there. Yeah. So no matter Yeah. Like I mean Substance Painter I mean you're baking it in because you're painting it then into a thing. But you can use the that's one of the mesh maps that's generated is like what is what is world up for this object that has been imported. And same thing here. This is the position of it. So, um yeah, and then you know Unreal Engine and uh Unity have you know in Unity it's called um shader graph and it's just shader nodes shader blueprints. Is that what they call it in Unreal? >> Materials. >> What's that? Material. material blueprints, blue material nodes, some sort of combination of those words. Um, but the same kind of stuff. The only problem is like as you've seen me struggle with like the different slightly different names for some of the slightly different for the same function. For instance, I always get like splitting Now, swizzle is different. There's a swizzle uh vectors anyway. Yep. So, I mean, that could be moss or anything like that. Let's see. Did you show us our Okay. Okay. Well, that looks But I did add texture to the table. My nice table. I did about the same nails and then >> yeah, it feels like the I mean the the weave is still maybe a little big here, but closer. This feels better than the chair one. >> Just the fabric. >> Yeah, like a runner on the table. This is >> completely decorative, nonfunctional tablecloth. >> Make it look nice. >> I was going to add the same pattern, but I just wanted to keep a separate table. >> Okay, cool. That's coming along. Uhuh. >> Here's Alec.",

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 05, 2025 Student Feedback: IKEA Chair Discovery No, that's not your That's That's the That's your wave. Here it is. Hey, this is Jack with ABC185 and we're take a look at the table and chair we did this week. So, uh here is that my table and chair. Yeah, it was it was really neat to to actually try to >> um make something, you know, realistic and grounded in reality. Um so yeah, that's in solid view. This is it in um wireframe view. I think it's pretty nice. Uh one thing I did notice was that I didn't rotate these um edges to like run along with uh with the bend. I think it still works, but uh yeah, something I noticed. Uh I had issues with the table. Like the bevel was acting really weird because it was like right. I didn't insert this like enough to give it space. So, it like had some weird stuff in Substance Painter, but I I went back and changed it. This is the the change version, so it looks it looks good now. But, um yeah, there was like some weirdness going on where like it was the bevels like colliding with each other, but I'm glad I caught that. We got to look at the UVs. So, uh here's the table UVs. >> Yeah, it looks like a a bigger bevel than certainly I did in the the chair example there. So, like, you know, you just increase the chances of that running over itself. But I mean it should have stopped before it like really crunched up unless you uncheck the >> limit. It did like a different algorithm. It did like an offset >> bevel instead of like the edge. >> I liked like the thicker bevel, but then >> yeah, it did that. >> Yeah. And so the other So, you know, if we want to be really realistically pedantic about it, right? like the thicker a soft a bigger area of rounding would make sense on all the outward facing corners but not really you know like makes sense on the inside facing ones, right? Like where like what like like unless you added more junk to it, right? Unless you filled it with putty or something, there would be no rounding there, right? It would still be two things meeting. And so in Blender, we should be able to do this with a vertex group, right? So if I were to add a bevel and give it uh some more rounding there. And then yeah. Okay. So, uh by default here it's angle, right? So everything sharper than this gets beveled. And so in your case, you know, you want that uh rounder outside edge, but then yeah, that inside edge, you know, like not only is it not like 100% realistic, it also presents these like, you know, modeling problems. So like let's lose it. Um and so you can say here and not there by using a vertex group. Um and let's make a vertex group. And so if we come in here and we say this, this and this in here data. Yeah, vertex group. You need to add a vertex group. Then you need to name it. So bevel. Then you need to assign the stuff that's selected to the vertex group. It doesn't give you any feedback that something has happened there, but I believe that should be the case. Now, if I come back and I say select. Yeah, it does select the ones I had there. And so, um, now you should be able to access that over here in the modifier. There we go. And so now those get beveled and the other ones do not. Right? And so you could just select all those outside facing edges, get that nice round bevel on the outside and then you know not even like those could just meet like that in the middle. Um, and yeah, that the seam placements were um, pretty standard. >> Like if it were metal, like like them being like welded together there or something like that, that would make sense, but for wood, not really. >> I was just trying to hide them a little bit. Um, have things like, you know, under and, you know, inside and stuff. Slightly different. But, um, I decided to do this where I, yeah, have the top one have more, um, textile space. And, um, yeah, I I think it works really nicely and, uh, it's really simple. Um, and then here is the chair. Um, pretty similar to what what you came up with. Yeah, I think it did pretty much the same cuts as that. Um, and I think it I think it works really nicely. And um, the stretching is not bad. There is a weird thing going on here. Some weird stretching going. I think it's the conformal. Um, like the conformal type is like stretching it in order to make it flat. Um, so it's like a good stretch, I guess. But it's like Yeah. Everything else turned out really nice, though. And um yeah, that's my UV maps. And all right, and so here's my table and chair in Substance Painter. And I thought it' be fun to play with like the wood grain and stuff, like the direction that things go. I was looking for inspiration on like what type of like wood I should do. Uh and I happened to find the exact chair that the blueprints are based on. >> Oh, there it is. It's this like IKEA chair. That's Wait, wait, wait. How much is this? Is this in like >> No, that's that's American dollars. >> Is that for like a hundred of them? Wait, how much is it? >> I think it's $1,500 for one chair. >> That can't be right. >> That feels like a scam. >> What is it called? Pin pinptor. >> Okay, hold on. We need to get to the bottom of this. I I've never looked it up, you know. You know, we've been doing this project for like five years. >> I mean, especially it's IKEA. Like, you know, you can buy a whole house for $1,500, >> you know? >> I think that's in like like even 60 is like that's not exactly the same chair. Here it is. Yeah, that's got to be in It's like a package. >> Well, I mean like uh Sweden is what the croner or are they on the euro now? >> No, they're on the croner. Z one United States. Yeah. So yeah, maybe that's four chairs at their in their currency or something like that. >> Has a dollar sign. >> It really does. Yeah. >> It's a tiny dollar sign. I mean, it says includes IVA. Isn't that this European something tax I forget the name of? Yeah, you're not on the American site. Yeah, this is some other currency. Yeah, I was going to say this can't this can't be a $1,500 chair. I mean, it's it's IKEA. We should totally buy them to put them together as like a >> as a as an exercise >> worth $1,500 a pin torp. Um but yeah, it has these screws on the side and I was like, \"That's a good idea. I should do that.\" So, um I added those on mine. Probably $1,500 worth of screws there. Um but yeah, I tried to do a bit of this. I mean, they probably have that hex wrench uh in them, you know, not uh American Phillips head on the side type of wood style, like the lighter like the lighter lighter color wood. So, yeah. And then I just uh copied the same wood over to the to the table as well. So, this is what I kind of came up with over here. So, we've got like the base um like wood texture down here and I put anchor point on it and then had everything um reference that. >> B says they can go with our >> $2,500 silverware. I had a little trouble like getting this to look good because there was like a a balance between like there was like a realistic amount of wear that was like difficult to get or it like looked too worn or like not worn enough. So, I don't know. It's a little tricky to balance that. But, this is what I came up with. I added this extra uh stain on the wood to give it um like from on the base some paint the paint uh stuff on it. Um the gradient that changes the color around and stuff. um a nice dirt layer that I focused on the bottom here. And then we also had like a dust layer on the top and added height to it. That might actually be too much height now I'm looking at it, but I wanted to look like there was like bits of dust on it, but I think that that looks a little too aggressive. See, I believe that's it. Uh thank you for watching and bye. [Music] >> Oh, I thought that was in your edit there. I was like, \"Oh, that's pretty dramatic.\" Yeah, that looks really good. I mean, the thing there with the the the other thing that would help make it look more worn is just like the the paint was like really vibrant, right? Like it would just be way, you know, more >> inconsistent and sun bleached and Yeah, like less saturated for sure. Um, >> yeah, this has got to be I mean, what language is hedge? Hello? Is that Swedish? >> I mean, they're all over the world. >> Does it say that too? [Music] Does it say that in the top right? >> Oh yeah, I guess it does. Even in America. Well, IKEA is a privately held company. It may be the p largest privately held company in the world. Um like there's no you can't buy stock in IKEA. >> Yeah. And so and as a result, they do not need to answer to stockholders. Um, and so they can remain they can keep a strong European identity and pay no political price in the United States right now. Um, yeah. I mean, I've heard that from multiple people. It's not like I've read a lot about that, but like it's definitely a very large privately held company. Yeah, that had to be for a couple of them. And then they used to Yeah. In fact, um, [Music] They used to have the 3D models available on the site. That site I originally got the blueprints from had it there. I don't tell anyone this until after the assignment's over. I mean, it's clearly still on the site because you can load this up, but maybe it's not directly linked anymore. Might be able to scrape it off of this. Oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah, because you can uh view it in AR. You can if you load this up on your phone, then you can it projects it into space, so you can see how big the furniture would be in your house. >> Yeah. I mean, a lot of furniture sites do that now. Yeah, that's a smaller one. Okay. Is that everybody? Looked at Jacks, Crimson, Evans, Thomas, Isabella, Alec. Oh, we didn't look at Andre's yet. I could have swear I downloaded this.",
    "transcript_segment": "No, that's not your That's That's the That's your wave. Here it is. Hey, this is Jack with ABC185 and we're take a look at the table and chair we did this week. So, uh here is that my table and chair. Yeah, it was it was really neat to to actually try to >> um make something, you know, realistic and grounded in reality. Um so yeah, that's in solid view. This is it in um wireframe view. I think it's pretty nice. Uh one thing I did notice was that I didn't rotate these um edges to like run along with uh with the bend. I think it still works, but uh yeah, something I noticed. Uh I had issues with the table. Like the bevel was acting really weird because it was like right. I didn't insert this like enough to give it space. So, it like had some weird stuff in Substance Painter, but I I went back and changed it. This is the the change version, so it looks it looks good now. But, um yeah, there was like some weirdness going on where like it was the bevels like colliding with each other, but I'm glad I caught that. We got to look at the UVs. So, uh here's the table UVs. >> Yeah, it looks like a a bigger bevel than certainly I did in the the chair example there. So, like, you know, you just increase the chances of that running over itself. But I mean it should have stopped before it like really crunched up unless you uncheck the >> limit. It did like a different algorithm. It did like an offset >> bevel instead of like the edge. >> I liked like the thicker bevel, but then >> yeah, it did that. >> Yeah. And so the other So, you know, if we want to be really realistically pedantic about it, right? like the thicker a soft a bigger area of rounding would make sense on all the outward facing corners but not really you know like makes sense on the inside facing ones, right? Like where like what like like unless you added more junk to it, right? Unless you filled it with putty or something, there would be no rounding there, right? It would still be two things meeting. And so in Blender, we should be able to do this with a vertex group, right? So if I were to add a bevel and give it uh some more rounding there. And then yeah. Okay. So, uh by default here it's angle, right? So everything sharper than this gets beveled. And so in your case, you know, you want that uh rounder outside edge, but then yeah, that inside edge, you know, like not only is it not like 100% realistic, it also presents these like, you know, modeling problems. So like let's lose it. Um and so you can say here and not there by using a vertex group. Um and let's make a vertex group. And so if we come in here and we say this, this and this in here data. Yeah, vertex group. You need to add a vertex group. Then you need to name it. So bevel. Then you need to assign the stuff that's selected to the vertex group. It doesn't give you any feedback that something has happened there, but I believe that should be the case. Now, if I come back and I say select. Yeah, it does select the ones I had there. And so, um, now you should be able to access that over here in the modifier. There we go. And so now those get beveled and the other ones do not. Right? And so you could just select all those outside facing edges, get that nice round bevel on the outside and then you know not even like those could just meet like that in the middle. Um, and yeah, that the seam placements were um, pretty standard. >> Like if it were metal, like like them being like welded together there or something like that, that would make sense, but for wood, not really. >> I was just trying to hide them a little bit. Um, have things like, you know, under and, you know, inside and stuff. Slightly different. But, um, I decided to do this where I, yeah, have the top one have more, um, textile space. And, um, yeah, I I think it works really nicely and, uh, it's really simple. Um, and then here is the chair. Um, pretty similar to what what you came up with. Yeah, I think it did pretty much the same cuts as that. Um, and I think it I think it works really nicely. And um, the stretching is not bad. There is a weird thing going on here. Some weird stretching going. I think it's the conformal. Um, like the conformal type is like stretching it in order to make it flat. Um, so it's like a good stretch, I guess. But it's like Yeah. Everything else turned out really nice, though. And um yeah, that's my UV maps. And all right, and so here's my table and chair in Substance Painter. And I thought it' be fun to play with like the wood grain and stuff, like the direction that things go. I was looking for inspiration on like what type of like wood I should do. Uh and I happened to find the exact chair that the blueprints are based on. >> Oh, there it is. It's this like IKEA chair. That's Wait, wait, wait. How much is this? Is this in like >> No, that's that's American dollars. >> Is that for like a hundred of them? Wait, how much is it? >> I think it's $1,500 for one chair. >> That can't be right. >> That feels like a scam. >> What is it called? Pin pinptor. >> Okay, hold on. We need to get to the bottom of this. I I've never looked it up, you know. You know, we've been doing this project for like five years. >> I mean, especially it's IKEA.

But um I was fairly certain that I was unmuted, but I for whatever reason the audio didn't capture, >> but yeah, no problem. So here is uh my table. >> Um it was fairly simple to work on. I think the legs were up. I made the legs a bit more complicated, more than I wanted them to, but I did add that slight curve. Here is the wireframe for it. Fairly clean. Um, and the UV.

So, let's see. Is this Yeah. So, it's being caused by like some weird internal geometry there. Where is the thing? for the statistics statistics. Okay. So if I select this so this is four vertices but I think four of them are on top of each other. If I were to just run the command here on the vertices. I didn't remove any of them. Yeah, you've got some just weird Let's see. Without being beveled. Yeah, you can see the gap in it right there. Where are we? >> Yeah, something like that. Let's see if there's any obvious fix fix for this. Why does it keep doing that? There we go. Yeah. So this is definitely the issue here. Like these additions >> like here. >> Yeah.

No. Maybe there is something there. I mean, let's see if that does that get rid of just the problem in general. Yeah, that thing's gone now.

So, >> just shades sharp because it's doing anything. >> Uh, shade flat flat. Yeah, >> yeah, I don't think it's doing anything because of those tiny things that are on top of each other.

Like just delete the geometry, dial in an appropriate bevel, and then reimpport over here. I don't think you even need to like reuv unwrap. Like, it should all be pretty good. and you'll have the bevel on the edge. Yeah, this one looks way more appropriate. I mean, to my eye, mostly because the wood grain is not real cranked like it looked on the table there. Just a little too too grainy. And then, yeah, you seem to use like this softer uh grunge perhaps that transitioned from the paint to the wood. And that that looks more, you know, subtle and interesting. So cool. All right.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 05, 2025 Spoon Modeling Demonstration we're making the silverware and we you know we went really deep on the fork um before and the knife you're on your own but with the the spoon I just wanted to sort of talk about the because a lot of people end up doing strange things with the spoon and just talk about the basic plan um there. And so I would start with a plane um just in terms of you know you we're going to be working with some reference here. But uh if we put a subd surface here on the plane uh we want to make sure that we have some sort of uh even number. If we're using the subd surface that'll automatically make sure there is. And so I might go yeah like this. And then I would apply that. There we go. And let's look at it. Okay. So this gives us what we got here. And we want to be able to um then go from here on the spoon. And so I would definitely be moving these vertices to where I would want them to get my general spoon shape. And uh then uh where I need to creating more geometry. So once starting with a basic shape like that start to procedurally or carefully rather add more geometry where it would be needed. to match whatever the shape is of your spoon. Um, and then start to rough out the handle simply by grabbing these edges here and uh extruding them down in this way. And then you can sort of refine the handle in all the ways that we talked about previously. Something along that and then going from there. But then here in the spoon, we want to be able to create this roundness, right? And so you're going to need more internal geometry here. So I might um go ahead and select these edges here and uh sort of reroute some of the geometry here. So if I dissolved these, do I still have the modifier on? No. Okay, good. Why is this dissolve edge actually taking out that vertex? Oh, I don't think that's clicked by default. This dissolve vertices over here and dissolve edges. I think maybe I had had that at some point. There we go. Uh, so now we can sort of reroute the geometry. If we grab this and we insert like so and insert and insert and then we could delete this and then uh use our loop select on this and uh go to grid fill and that's going to give us quads inside then. And so now we have a topology that's going to um you know if we turn on this and GZ right it's going to work with the shape of a spoon much better there. So yeah in the reason I was deleting those vertices is because that was a checkbox on the dissolve edge thing. Um, yeah, it would be great if this stuff just simply wasn't hidden under this box and when every time you used a tool, it showed up in the interface without you having to look for it. Seems like a pretty easy one. There's probably an add-on for it. I'll look and see. Um, but yeah, now we've got something that's going to work. And again, our two modifiers here that are going to help us quite a bit are the solidify, which is going to do our sort of like automatic extrusion, and our subdurface because that's going to sort of smooth everything around. But that allows us to have you know starting with that subdivided plane gives us even numbers gives us all quads and we can just you know we don't have uh the same exactly the same kind of situation as we do with the fork in that uh since we have this radial thing here and then this handle they can just sort of be extruded out from that part there. And so obviously there's a lot of massaging of points that needs to be done here to get it to match up, but the topological plan is solid there. Um, and yeah, thinking about how remember all of the silverware is going to have some kind of curvature to the profile there. And we're not gonna, you know, you look for your own reference, but you're not going to have as most likely not a clean reference like we do with the chair. that the chair is like sort of at best, you know, someone says model this and they get they give you a perfectly accurate blueprint with measurements on it. You're like great, okay, no problem. Right? A lot of times it's way less than that. Like here's a blurry photo of something that I took, you know, moving my phone around and can you model this? So, uh, this gives us something to work with there. So yeah, uh dissolving all those into a big engon and then sort of extruding in gives us this uh quad topology and then using the grid fill automatically makes all the inner stuff uh quads which then as we know works beautifully with the subdivision surface. And then we go. And you got a really thick spoon",

Um the only this you hit the basics on all of these and uh good excellent work. you know, up here the hat bobs up and down and you did a good job of, you know, animating the hat down and back up and then delaying that from the up and down of the character itself. Right? So, this is one of our fundamental principles of animation. What do we call this? Hats, hair, >> follow through or secondary animation. I mean, they might as well call it hats and hair. Um, so good there. Uh, from a run standpoint, yeah, like the the ankle stays kind of bent as opposed to like kind of pointing a little bit more at the end of the run. That's pretty minor, but the speed at which you have the run happening in Unity um, is good. it, you know, fits the cartoony nature of the character in that, you know, if we wanted it the pace at which he's moving and the pace at which the feet are moving. It's much faster. It seems that the feet are moving, which is a very legit technique here to make it look a little bit more cartoony. You know, the legs scrambling there. But good job managing the um staff in terms of getting it moving with the character. That's maybe another opportunity for secondary animation in that that arm that's carrying the staff because it's such, you know, presumably a heavy thing would be delayed from the rest of the body movement. I mean, you would notice it most on the jump, I think, if you wanted to make a change there. But in terms of the speed of the transitions, that's this. But as we discussed previously, coming in here and adjusting it in this view is uh can be problematic because this the length of this timeline is not normalized. It's scaled to include um it has to include the entire box which represents the entire time of the animation clips. The one coming the one that you're coming from and the one that you're going to. And so if this whole timeline is scaled depending on those the length of those clips, which is not the same for everybody. Um, so a better strategy here is to unfold this tiny arrow right here and then there's this setting that says transition time and you can dial that in in some and it's in, you know, fractions of a second there. Okay, so this is different. This this is all all the timing here. The time that we put into these or in the other um blend tree.

Um the only this you hit the basics on all of these and uh good excellent work. you know, up here the hat bobs up and down and you did a good job of, you know, animating the hat down and back up and then delaying that from the up and down of the character itself. Right? So, this is one of our fundamental principles of animation. What do we call this? Hats, hair, >> follow through or secondary animation. I mean, they might as well call it hats and hair. Um, so good there. Uh, from a run standpoint, yeah, like the the ankle stays kind of bent as opposed to like kind of pointing a little bit more at the end of the run. That's pretty minor, but the speed at which you have the run happening in Unity um, is good. it, you know, fits the cartoony nature of the character in that, you know, if we wanted it the pace at which he's moving and the pace at which the feet are moving. It's much faster. It seems that the feet are moving, which is a very legit technique here to make it look a little bit more cartoony. You know, the legs scrambling there. But good job managing the um staff in terms of getting it moving with the character. That's maybe another opportunity for secondary animation in that that arm that's carrying the staff because it's such, you know, presumably a heavy thing would be delayed from the rest of the body movement. I mean, you would notice it most on the jump, I think, if you wanted to make a change there. But in terms of the speed of the transitions, that's this. But as we discussed previously, coming in here and adjusting it in this view is uh can be problematic because this the length of this timeline is not normalized. It's scaled to include um it has to include the entire box which represents the entire time of the animation clips. The one coming the one that you're coming from and the one that you're going to. And so if this whole timeline is scaled depending on those the length of those clips, which is not the same for everybody. Um, so a better strategy here is to unfold this tiny arrow right here and then there's this setting that says transition time and you can dial that in in some and it's in, you know, fractions of a second there. Okay, so this is different. This this is all all the timing here. The time that we put into these or in the other um blend tree. These are absolute timings in seconds as opposed to when we scroll down or zoom in to the After Effects or Blender timeline which will by default be in frames. But for the re I mean why"

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 05, 2025 Student Feedback: Robot Animation Issues gone horribly wrong, this is the better strategy as a student so that we can look at what's going on and to offer some advice as opposed to just not turning something in. So, well done. tomorrow for the actual uh assignment live stream in class. So, here's my animation, right? Here's his idol. Quick little idol. There's a little claw clap. Turns his head. Look, it's around. Yeah, that's my idol. And I put it in Unity. And the thing I did with it, um, I watched a video and it said for more rigid movement, um, to pretty much you parent, Whoops. You parent the object to the bone itself because I was like, \"Oh, he's a robot. He should be moving more like rigidly and not have the deformities and all that.\" So that's what I did pretty much. Like the head is parented to this bone. Go like that. Pose mode. Click it. Control P. Parent to bone. I mean, I've already done it, so it looks weird. So, pretty much when I move the bone, the head moves, too. If I move this bone, the arm moves. If I move this bone, that moves. So forth and so on. But because of that, um, all the individual bones have animation instead of just the armature because that's what I'm assuming is here since it's the armature idle animation. So, it's all of the animations cooked into the armature versus minor cooked into each individual bone. So, is there a way to make it to where it all just goes into the armature or do I have to completely restart all of my stuff and figure out a different way? >> Yeah. So, yeah, you made different animation clips for each bone. So, that's why it looks like this. when you bring in each. Also, your guy is sideways. And I noticed you did that with the chair, too. I don't know if you're rotating Blender in like a weird way or if your export settings are strange. Remember, the blue arrow should be up in Blender while you're working. That's this up axis. And then check your export settings. They look like the ones I've been using when we export stuff. If you're using that export delivery kit, it should well, it will fix it correctly if your object is facing up in Blender. So if that's not the case then then you could end up with something like this because we don't want to be you know ostensibly you're like well just rotate it in unity. Yeah but that I mean that may work but then it seems like it's going to present a bunch of other problems in the way that it communicates the hierarchy of the system. Anyway, this is the problem we want. You want to have one singular clip per um per armature, not separate clips for each bone. Let me see. Did you send the Blender file? The fact that you weighted the parts 100% to each bone shouldn't affect that. It's just where you ended up key framing. Uh that is probably the underlying problem here. And you did not send the blend file. Uh send the blend file. Uh let's see if we can see. Yeah. Uh, so you're not looking at the outliner here. This looks like the file view where you can see all the individual actions. And yeah, the I can't really see your workflow here, but at some point you made new actions for each arm or for each bone, and that's not correct. So, delete all of these actions. So, we just have this action. And so, when you're working, this should say idle up here at all times. And your key framing the bones, right? The key framing of the bones is completely independent of the weighting of the bones. There's two two separate structures. just one structure, you know, the weight the uh vertex weight uh map which figures out how much each bone affects each vertex and then the bones themselves have their own um key frames. And so at some point, whatever you watched was creating new actions for each bone, and that's where you went wrong. You want to get rid of these, keep that one. And when you're animating here, when you select a bone bone and then turn on key framing, that should um add to a list here, right? You should see the key frames that you're putting on the armature accumulate over here as more and more body parts get animated. So yeah, once you delete the other actions and you're in the idle action, get out of the action editor because I think you're pressing this to create more actions and that's not correct. You want to be back to the dope sheet or fcurve mode. And under view, you want to select um you want to deselect the only show current or only show selected so that you're seeing all of the stuff that's animated. So yeah, the the main thing was that you started creating more actions and that's not uh what we want to do here because this is going to be Yeah, that's not going to work. You have a ton of extra clips in Unity there and that's not it's not going to work. All right, Amy.",
    "transcript_segment": "gone horribly wrong, this is the better strategy as a student so that we can look at what's going on and to offer some advice as opposed to just not turning something in. So, well done. tomorrow for the actual uh assignment live stream in class. So, here's my animation, right? Here's his idol. Quick little idol. There's a little claw clap. Turns his head. Look, it's around. Yeah, that's my idol. And I put it in Unity. And the thing I did with it, um, I watched a video and it said for more rigid movement, um, to pretty much you parent, Whoops. You parent the object to the bone itself because I was like, \"Oh, he's a robot. He should be moving more like rigidly and not have the deformities and all that.\" So that's what I did pretty much. Like the head is parented to this bone. Go like that. Pose mode. Click it. Control P. Parent to bone. I mean, I've already done it, so it looks weird. So, pretty much when I move the bone, the head moves, too. If I move this bone, the arm moves. If I move this bone, that moves. So forth and so on. But because of that, um, all the individual bones have animation instead of just the armature because that's what I'm assuming is here since it's the armature idle animation. So, it's all of the animations cooked into the armature versus minor cooked into each individual bone. So, is there a way to make it to where it all just goes into the armature or do I have to completely restart all of my stuff and figure out a different way? >> Yeah. So, yeah, you made different animation clips for each bone. So, that's why it looks like this. when you bring in each. Also, your guy is sideways. And I noticed you did that with the chair, too. I don't know if you're rotating Blender in like a weird way or if your export settings are strange. Remember, the blue arrow should be up in Blender while you're working. That's this up axis. And then check your export settings. They look like the ones I've been using when we export stuff. If you're using that export delivery kit, it should well, it will fix it correctly if your object is facing up in Blender. So if that's not the case then then you could end up with something like this because we don't want to be you know ostensibly you're like well just rotate it in unity. Yeah but that I mean that may work but then it seems like it's going to present a bunch of other problems in the way that it communicates the hierarchy of the system. Anyway, this is the problem we want. You want to have one singular clip per um per armature, not separate clips for each bone. Let me see. Did you send the Blender file? The fact that you weighted the parts 100% to each bone shouldn't affect that. It's just where you ended up key framing. Uh that is probably the underlying problem here. And you did not send the blend file. Uh send the blend file. Uh let's see if we can see. Yeah. Uh, so you're not looking at the outliner here. This looks like the file view where you can see all the individual actions. And yeah, the I can't really see your workflow here, but at some point you made new actions for each arm or for each bone, and that's not correct. So, delete all of these actions. So, we just have this action. And so, when you're working, this should say idle up here at all times. And your key framing the bones, right? The key framing of the bones is completely independent of the weighting of the bones. There's two two separate structures. just one structure, you know, the weight the uh vertex weight uh map which figures out how much each bone affects each vertex and then the bones themselves have their own um key frames.

So, for my first animation, I finished the cat eye animation, and I made sure to add extra movement in the ears and tail as a way to kind of show like more expression.

Uh, for my next animation, I made sure that the feet connect to the floor and that the positions of the leg passing each other look somewhat normal. And I made the ears and the tail extra bouncy to show more weight in the movements.

Go to the bathroom. Uh, next here's my walk. I did all of these at 60 frames so that it would be potentially easier to make adjustments in Unity. Here is my run and here is my jump. Then in Unity, uh, Razor's face down right now, but that gets fixed. >> So I >> Why does he face plant on like is it just where you had it positioned or like >> So the initial animation I had was the twerking. >> Um, I don't know why it's sideways, but So when you import them just by default he's sideways. >> Yeah. >> Huh. That's weird. >> Using a blend tree. So here's little jump and you'll see it transitions. Now it is the the idle. Now it's the walk and then it goes into the run. So yeah. Um had a lot of problems. Uh right now Razer is uh like face down. Um that is because I had I did start with the idle pose. I started with the dance from last week. Um so uh there that's just the default frame until there's any input. Um but yeah, so that goodbye. Hello, this is Razor. >> Okay, great. Um, let me see it in action again. >> So, here's little jump and you'll see it. >> Okay, so this stuff is there but just not active. >> Yeah, I was doing that first and I'm like, oh, wait, no, >> right. >> Now it is the the idle. Now it's still walk and then it goes to the run. So, yeah. Um, had a lot of problems. Uh right now Razer is uh like yeah so it's coming in with these values. How did you export it from Unity? >> I exported it from Blender. >> Oh yeah, Blender. Yeah. Oh >> no. This is the top. This is the top. I can't see your hierarchy over here. So, wait, is your animator at the very >> on the character, not the parent? >> I couldn't get the animation to work when the animator was on the But this looks like it's because this is the top. This is the top of the hierarchy, right? Because that's where the character controller script is. And so the animator is up here as well. >> Should the anim should the character controller script not be on? >> No. >> Okay. >> Yeah. So the character controller script is the top of the hierarchy and definitely not rotated. >> Okay. Um, and then the animation should live below that. And so the thing that links them is dragging the anim the object with the animator, you know, what you're exporting from Blender into here. >> I could have been doing something wrong at that moment. >> Yeah. I mean, >> yeah, because the having those rotation values up at the top to correct for the other stuff like that that's I think that's probably asking for problems like any anytime you get have just like in Blender, you know, like the apply scale, you know, like we need the top of it to not be skewed because the of the fundamental situation where not only does the child adopt the move with the parent. If the parent's scale or rotation are changed, that transmutes down the thing as well, which in the case of a character where there's all this what ends up being a very complex hierarchy, like then there's just all these emergent problems if there's any weirdness up at the top. So, that looks okay for now, but like I mean, it's worth probably working that out at this point. Um, yeah, you want the Yeah. And so, you know, here's the top. This is where the character controller is. And then this is the, you know, top of the Blender export. And this is where the animator is. And by dragging the this object into that field, you know, the animator gets the commands where those parameters of speed and and the other stuff. Um, and so yeah, I would I would I would do that. The whole thing is set up to be separated like that so that the, you know, by separating everything off into separate objects like that, it just makes it theoretically a little more flexible. Um, yeah, I mean that that's working. The the main thing here from like a visual standpoint is that yeah the uh all the animation like the the fundamental positioning of the body is correct in that like you've got the opposites forward and that kind of stuff. Everything feels a little floaty because at no point does it seem we don't have enough up and down in the torso. And then secondly, even in the run and then if you want to do this fidgety thing, that's that's fine. But the the thing about shifting your weight is that you're shifting your weight. Your weight still has to land on one of the feet. Like something needs to be holding you up. And in in your idol over here, >> um, >> bathroom. >> Yeah. Like the feet are in constant motion. It looks more like a >> I did all of them, >> I think. Was that the very beginning? >> There's an idol. It's a little ADHD mark. >> Yeah. And so rather than you like I can't even do it, right? Because the laws of physics mean I would fall. I can't float, right? And so like it would be over here. I I would the strategy I would do here is maybe grab all of the key frames and change them to um not interpolate whatever Blender calls that off the top of my head. I can't remember. Um, so that it's just snapping to the positions. And so that you want to have a position here where there's like clearly you're standing on this leg and then clearly standing on this leg. And so you just need some hold key frames so that we're here and then we're here and then we're here. If the rest of the body is kind of like loosey goosey, that can work. But your feet need to be on something, right? in order to um in order for it to not seem really floaty, right? Like by by not having the the weight ever be totally on anything. And the fact that it's like this the system that we have also um emphasizes floatiness in that like there is this separation between the capsule space and the animated character. And so we have to create the illusion that the character's, you know, hitting the ground even though the capsule is sort of like sliding around the whole thing all the time. So, so yeah, that's that's the biggest one is that in here, right? I mean, I might even if you want to have a longer idle, that's fine because it'll get interrupted by the controls. And so, you know, here and then and then and then, you know, um and the other thing is, you know, with a character head this big, maybe a little bit more of the the head, I mean, just it eats up so much of the visual space here that I think you're missing an opportunity for some secondary animation. Is the mohawk rigged as a separate bone or no? Okay, that's fine. We'll assume it's just really that really really strong hair >> hair. >> Yeah. That um keeps it in place 100%. >> Does not move when you use hair. >> Hair cement. >> Yeah, that's what it's called. >> Yeah. To keep it up like that. Yeah. Yeah. At no point like it may be surprising to hear, but at no point in my life have I had a mohawk of this. Um Yeah. You guys don't know what my past is like, but I'll I'll let you in that much. and that that hasn't happened. But who knows what the future holds",

Um, first of all, I haven't been successfully able to get the pedal to be rigged to Margaret at all. um you were previously you were mentioning something um about parenting the flower petals to the head and I had a question about how you would go about doing that because um whenever I do that it doesn't really seem to work out very well. Uh when I initially just had the pedals rigged to uh the actual rig, um I ended up going with uh Rigipy. I looked at some videos uh how to do that because I couldn't get my initial rig worked okay, but it wouldn't pose very well. it didn't have that uh inverse uh kinetics which made it really challenging to pose and I couldn't get uh Miximo to work with my character at all. Even when I rotated the character in Blender and had the correct orientation, it wasn't recognizing I think it wasn't recognizing me putting um the points onto the character. Even without the flower version, even without the petals and like just the circle as the head, uh I get some pretty bad deformation. And even with the weight painting, the weight painting doesn't really it's like having a weird issue with rigify, I think. So, I just kind of removed the pedals for now. Um, pose mode. I can get like the head to turn. All right. Uh, this kind of, you know, different different stuff moves with the character. I used a a a ri a rig from rigify and applied it to uh my character here. Uh I am having some trouble like everything else is going okay, but moving the arms I'm I'm just having like a lot of trouble with it. It's just like doing some weird uh just some weird stuff. Like I'd like the arm to kind of like cross over the body, but it kind of deforms kind of funny. I I don't know how to get like a better control over that or if I just need to mess with um the thing that it just it just looks kind of not good. I don't know if that's just the way I built the character, but those are kind of some of the major things I ran into before I wanted to kind of continue uh with this project.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 05, 2025 Rigify Controls and Setup Okay. Um, let's see what we can do here as is. So, it is mapped here to rigify. Okay. The issue with the rigify rig is the default one has a lot of controls. Um, so the legs are default in IK and inverse kinematics. A lot of people skip like this syllable or sometimes that syllable. Uh, kinematics, right? Uh, so that everybody once they see the this moving, the hips and the feet staying placed, they're like, \"Oh, yeah, that's great.\" Um and then the other difference here is that by default the default for the arms is also IK right and the opposite of IK is the easy to remember forward kinematics right um and the rigify has both and so but you can't have um you can like blend between them, but for our purposes, it's probably better to be in one or the other. And so over here, uh with this selected Yeah. So, you've got it rigged with rigify. Up here under item in this one, uh this is where we get some more controls and down here rig layers. So again, this is all this information is only applicable if you use the rigify process. And um all of these you want to get everything out of here that's not you're not going to use for animating because it's confusing and you can click on the wrong stuff. So, all of these tiny spheres, these are the a lot of them are the tweak bones, which sounds like, you know, you did the wrong drugs or something, but um they're just for doing fine adjustments to the movements that result from the main bones. And so, the first thing here, I'm going to get rid of I'm going to stop tweaking and get rid of all the tweak bones. I'm not getting rid of them. I'm just sort of like making them not visible. Okay. And you see that that um clears up my view substantially. Um secondly is that here on the arms I think in your case um based on what you want to do uh probably FK is going to be more useful for your arms than IK. And so if you're going to use FK for the arms in order to do that kind of like across the body, um the that means you're going to be animating the rotation, right? This is where IK and FK the strategic implementation of animating with IK animating what parameter? What transform parameter? Not Jack, right? Amy, when you moved your legs, what were you animating that made your leg go like this? For those of you who can't see right now, I'm leg is pawing the ground like a horse. Like a trained horse. A horse that's trained to count. >> What? >> The knee. >> No, you didn't do the knee, right? The knee automatically was moving, right? Because you had it rigged. Did you use the Mixmo thing or did you build your own? >> I don't know. Okay. So, you were doing the rotation because if you didn't make an IK controller, yours were FK and so you were using the rotation, right? And if you're using IK, you're using the position, right? In my notes, I would write this down. This is not Blender specific information. This is, you know, inverse kinematics and forward kinematics are ubiquitous computer graphics concepts. And so for IK it is going to be position. And so here in this whole business I'm gonna say don't show me these arm IKs. And then come in here. And now I can uh we have that on. We have that on up here. FK. Which hand is this? This is the left. Yeah. And so here, this is not changing the functionality. It's just showing us the correct thing up here. This is showing us the correct thing. IK to FK hand. Turn that up. There we go. Now I'm able to rotate this. And this may what I think for you, Meline, will be a much more naturalistic way to pose the arms of this character. Okay. And then for your hips, yeah, the big box here is going to be the thing that allows you to get your character twerking as well here because that's where all of this apparently is headed. Okay, good. All right, we've cleaned up some stuff there. Um, you need to do the same thing over here on this one is you need to turn up I was doing that one right. Nope. This one. There we go. And now the green ones here which are visible are easily posed. And if we come back here, let's just double check. Good. Okay. Let's see if we can fix this. Um head situation. I'm going to grab the pedals and shift drag them to the rig to make them a child. Then we'll come over here to object mode and select the rig or actually uh now that they're here, let's uh again I hold down shift drag them underneath here so they are a child. Now over here in object mode, if we go to weight paint view, you'll see that they are blue, meaning that they have no weights. Whereas if we come over here, uh hate that we can't go that we have to go back here and then select this and then select this and then there we go. That's 100% head. If we look at this, that's the head vertex group. And so we need to get these weights over there. So let's come back up to object. Let's come back to pedal and what if we just join the head and the petal? So I selected those two and I press control J. Back here, back here. Back here. No. I thought we might get lucky with a one-click solution there, but not. Okay, so here. Let's come back to the pedal. And we need to get these assigned to that bone. So, select this one in object mode. Go to weight paint and go to head. And these are red now. Is that just a residual of having joined them because they were blue before? If so, that's a weird hack. But let's see. Okay, they weren't moving because they didn't have the armature modifier. Let's try this. Usually, we do this at the beginning, but this Let's see. This might work now. Let's get pedal. Shiftclick the rig. So, just those two. Control P. Control P let's say parent to object or did it the wrong way from here to here. So parented now instead of just dragging it into there, doing the parent with automatic weights does give it the thing that was missing before, which in object mode is the armature deform. But now we should see some more interesting data which is responsible for our current problem in the head. See all those get the exact same. Let's look at the other bones. Everything's 100% head. We're going to rig one. You had extra armatures on the body and the head. That's probably not great. in here under weight paint. Yeah, everything's 100% to the head. Why would it distort them as soon as it dis the distortion should be coming from the other bones and step back Let's try one other strategy. What if we copied the pedals into the head mesh? So, I'm going to go into edit mode and grab all of this and control C and then turn it off. Then go into the head mesh and go into object or edit mode and controll V. doesn't like that either. Let's do the join thing one more time. In object mode, I'm just going to join these two. Control J.",

Um cuz all of those are mapped to here 100% head which is where we'd want to be. But why it's splattering them all over the place when we join them. to changing the anchor point. Do they move even though they're splattered? Let's see. Yeah, they are. But even though they say they're 100% head, they're not 100% head. Is there some? Yeah, a little bit right there. Um, wow. Those colors are very subtle. Right. Watch the bottom there. Very slightly. Okay. And so head Auto normalize 100% strength weight. I'm painting to zero. I have a normalize on, which should be getting rid of the other stuff. Now, if I put it back up to one to get everything else, autonormalize should mean that it goes to 100. And now it's at 100 for this, but the other ones are still there. So now There we go. Zero. Still no movement. What if we ran autonormalize directly? No difference. Let's see if this is even the problem that we think it is. Seems at some point we should erase enough weights that these come back. So autonormalize clearly not doing what it says it's doing here in that you know I have it checked up here we ran it specifically normalize all. How about just normalize? We see that they're slowly coming back to the original position. There we go. Again, I just keep erasing them. Just painting zero. I remember looking at this before. No one came across this way. You were working, right? Something to just nuke all the weights. All right. So on the head, these are all the vertex groups that are part of this. And I'm going to delete them. So I went into the green one here on weight paint mode on the head mesh. And if I just start deleting all the other vertex groups that have any sort of influence, I can get back to that. Beautiful. Now for There heat. Let's delete that other armature rig one. Yep. It's going to be there's some because there's this extra level of abstraction with our bone groups and the bones listed as deformed bones versus control bones in all these controls are actually separate bone objects. Okay. Well, we know how to clean this up. Now what you should do is fuse head, body, and pedals and then redo the rigify. And then you will not have to do any of this. You might have to clean up the weights on the head a little bit, but at least it'll be correctly done at that point because this we've got a 100% head here, but it's still not working because there's some sort of other bone group or the head vertex group is not linked to the correct bone. that's actually doing the deformation there. The rigify thing is super flexible but also super complex. So we have these extra bone groups in there. Once you have everything fused, I would give the mixo thing another try because that's going to be substantially less time consuming. Hence, you know, me not showing everybody this to begin with.

Um, I don't know if that's something I would maybe have to fix like in Blender itself and bring everything up or maybe like keep trying with the collider because I tried a lot of things but they would still clip to the floor.

I'm not going to have like a run animation or a jump animation, but I am going to have uh a walk animation and a crouch animation. And so that's what I did for this week. Um I didn't finish the crouch walk animation yet, but I'm currently working on it. Um but anyways, um here is the idle animation in Blender. Um, it's pretty uh calm, normal, little slouch to him. Um, yep. And and it loops perfectly. And then here is my walk animation. Um, it's a little clunky. There's something going on um at the end here kind of. It's it's a little weird. Um, and he's he's very like deliberate about his steps. So, um yeah, I might tweak that a little bit, but um yeah, it works. It works for what it is. Um and it loops perfectly as well.

I'm really happy how it turned out. And also, his name is James. I I've I've come to that um decision. So, uh this is James crouching. And then here he is in Unity again. Yeah. So, I don't have the crouch walk animation yet. And I also I'm not sure how to um how to swap between I I think we're going to go over it soon, but uh swapping between like, you know, the standing state and the crouching state. So, this is him uh all hooked up. Uh again, yeah, I think he needs some more tweaking on the speed and the animation speed and stuff, but >> yeah. So, skating, right? So, how do you adjust for skating? >> Change. >> Yeah. Yeah. Higher. Higher. Yeah. Um I think it works pretty nice. And just so you can see it, here is the um crouch. Again, no no walk for it yet, but um I I think it looks pretty nice. Um so yeah, I kept the default transition speeds because I feel like they worked pretty nice, but obviously they could be tweaked. And uh yeah, I made the speed parameter like yeah point4 because he's only going like a maximum of like 1.3 speed. So yeah, he's gonna be a slow a slow character. But um yeah. Yeah, I'm going to keep working on the crouch walk animation right now. And uh yeah, that's everything. Thank you and goodbye. Yeah, so I mean the speed there, that's the anim animation.

Yeah. >> Okay. >> Yeah. Okay. Cool. Um, yeah, we can look at the other part.

So that scale is one one one uh because it trickles down the entire chain and so everything's kind of set up here. The default um capsule is like twoish unity units high which is a unity unit is ostensibly like around a meter and so that's you know six foot regular person height right so it's like kind of well calibrated there and so you want your size even if yours is a little bit shorter to meet that and so you know like you scaled you just scaled the wrong thing to match, right? And so what you want to do rather is this. And so just anything. Okay, here's a bot. And so I put this in here. Grab this and make it a child up here. And uh reset it. There you go. And in here, if I look this way from the side like this. Um, so this is the adjustment I was talking about before, having this bottom of your feet matching there. And then secondly, if my Ybot was massively wrong size, instead of adjusting this scale, right? So anytime you come into something and you start messing with the transform scale numbers, take a pause and be like, wait, do I know what I'm doing here? Right? Am I making something? Do I have a tree and I want to make a tree that's 2x? If that's the case, yes, you're doing the right thing. If it's some other instance, then perhaps not. And so in the actual import of the mesh here under model scale factor, this is like the how big is the default coming in, right? And so if my character was too small and I had to make it bigger, I would say two and apply. And now you see that Ybot is still one. Character controller is still one. And so there won't be any weirdness going down the chain there from the scale numbers. Does that make sense? >> And so that's probably what you because you made it bigger. Your character was probably was it was too big, right? Or >> Yeah. My charact Well, my character was too big. >> Too big. And so you need to go into Mr. for Peppermint's um you know main um FBX there and you know make it something like 02 or something like that and bring that in like so. And >> does the capital have to like fit the character? Is that like the goal you're trying to do or >> Well, I mean yours is like a little more squat, right? And so, um, if you need to make the capsule shorter, the capsule collider height can bring this down. Um, yeah. So, there's two things here. There's like the capsule collider which is being used for the trigger box and then there's the charact character controller. So you can see that when we do this they change from the center. And so if you change this you would need to offset them. And so you would need to change their height and their offset to get a more squat um more of a peppermint sized capsule. Does that make sense? >> Yeah. >> And so you'd really want to take the time to make sure that these lined up. So just making sure that you're able to get that just right because we want this and this for the sake of the character control functionality to fit.

    "video_id": "eXHP6I6j_D4",
    "search_text": "AVC200 November 05, 2025 Substance Painter Texture Export Let's bring the textures over. We have to export textures. But we need to select the Unity URP export settings. Um, this is a little bit more complicated because you need to have multiple render pipelines and so there's separate settings for the other one, the HDR RP. Um, and because it's the main character, you know, whatever. Most of you probably painted at 2048 and so bringing it exporting at 20 48 makes sense. If you're unhappy with the textures at 2048, you could bump up the export to 4096. And a lot of that, you know, would be like are is the camera going to be fairly close to the character at regularly throughout like how close is our view? If our view is further away, like it's probably not as necessary there. Um, and then we need to take the textures, right? And so this is going to be a bunch of um PNGs by default. I think it'll export one JPEG as well. I can't remember. Um, and then bring them into Unity and then put them on the correct channels for the Unity material. Uh, this is a little bit different in that the Unity materials are super are designed to be more performant. And so there's something here. The thing that you should understand conceptually is that there is channel packing. And so when we export and go from substance to blender, each channel has its own texture, right? We get an alpha uh we get a metallic and then a separate um roughness, right? Uh because roughness and metallic are two separate sliders with me there in Blender. That's fine. And that that obviously makes it easy to understand what's happening. And in Blender, usually you just have this big list of textures and you're just sort of routing one to one. The reason they use channel packing is that um every time you load another texture into memory, um that's a performance hit and you're also eating up more um memory. the number of channels in a texture. It's going to be faster if we can put more stuff in one file. And so that's what channel packing is, is that Unity is going to pack expect a bunch of things to be packed here. So if we look at this, we look at this file export textures and I'm going to say make a folder for this because it's going to be multiple things in here. in here. This will be Pep textures. There we go. Okay, great. And so now this is where the key thing happens, right? In output template. Uh Crimson I think wandered into this view. We're like, what's going on here? This is for um setting up the templates. So we don't need to touch this. Come back to here. This is which template are we using? And we can scroll down to Unity universal render pipeline uh metallic. Um leave that as is. Leave this as is. Let's see what size I presume this is a 2048. We'll leave it as is. Um, and we will export. And in Gavin's case, he gets a he did emission painting. And so there's an additional um texture for emission. Okay. And the other thing I would write down in my notes is albido is the fancy physics word for color. Essentially the surface color of the mesh. For a while the default renderer in Unity used that word instead of color until they decided to stop being so obtuse and just called it color. Um, so there we go. Now, uh, back over here. Let's see. I don't think I have the mesh. So, I'm just going to also export the mesh here. You don't need to do this part because your FBX is already there in Unity. back here. It's like a stay puff marshmallow man. I mean, maybe there's something like that happens. Like, how how occult is this story going to get? >> Uh, I didn't think of that. >> Food food for thought. Food for thought, right? Um, and so, yeah, Mr. Peppermint way too big. And so, his scale factor, let's cut him down a notch here. Let's put him at 0.1. There he goes. All right. And then let's uh put him back on the ground. There he is. Might get weird. >> So check Mr. Peppermint's >> I probably didn't apply scale. >> Yes, >> it is. >> I think that's it. >> Yeah, that's why I got why I got weird there. So yeah, if you're importing him and these numbers are not 111, go back and make that change. Um, okay, there's that. Now, if I make uh well, if we just look at Mr. Peppermint, we need a material here. I'm going to make a new material, and this will be PEP. And uh just make sure I can see that this is different. And put this on here. And there we go. Okay. And so now uh back here. Let's look at what we got. Um this, this, and this. So here's the albido and transparency. Here's the um emission. And here's the uh metallic and smoothness and the normal map. Okay. And so those of you who didn't use emission, you won't have this one. You'll just have three, right? Um, and so this is where the channel packing is happening. Metallic and smoothness are packed into one texture. I believe the metallic is stored on the red channel and the first channel and the smoothness is stored on the G, the green channel. Uh, so this the color and appearance of this um metal smoothness may look weird. It may look like really green or really red depending on what's going on, but it its actual color has nothing to do with its functionality. Much like a normal map, right, where we're we're viewing the color, but the color channels are just because the computer has to show us something. it's interpreting it as pixel color, but it's actually an angle in XYZ stored in RGB, right? And so just thinking once you get beyond color, all this other stuff becomes much more clear if you can understand images as just data containers, right? They're just channels of data. And so here in the PEP material, we can populate this. This should go onto here. Um, let's put this back to white. There we go. And then, uh, you guessed it. The metallic map goes on to metallic smoothness. Give it a second. There it goes. And so this this is why there's no box here for smoothness because both of these things are stored in that one. Okay. Um, and then the normal map is a little bit different. You need to tell Unity that this is a normal map for the reasons that we just talked about, right? You need to not interpret this as color data. You need to interpret it as a normal map. And so when you select it in the asset settings, texture type, uh, normal. It seems like it does automatically pick that up sometimes now. But, um, yeah. Now back here. Here I drag this into the normal map. Here we go. And then you guessed it, the emission can go into the uh uh first you need to say yes, emission. Then you get a slot for the emission map. And then Do we need to make it brighter? I don't know why the cigar part is not showing up. >> It's because you're using the old texture. >> Oh, okay. Oh, you hadn't done that yet. Okay, thank you. Um, so yeah, the here, uh, what am I doing? I loaded in. Does it matter if this is Yeah, we don't want it to be black. I don't think this would work if we did this. Yeah. Um, and so you have to say yes, emission map. Load the emission in there. And then this HDR stands for what? >> High dynamic range. >> Yes. Everyone else knew that too, right? >> Maybe write it down this time. Maybe high dynamic range, right? High dynamic range. Brighter than bright. Brighter than bright. Right. This the screen is only capable of showing you kind of this is actually changing values between zero and one. Right? 111 is white. The screen can't get brighter than that. Okay. But in the game, in the system, in the rendering system, you can crank stuff up brighter than that. And then it activates the glow, right? And so that's what makes the emission look emissiony, right? Makes it look like it's lit up. Remember, the glow doesn't really look like much of anything if we don't the emission doesn't look like much of anything unless we have the global volume which has the glow on it, which is there by default pretty much now. So, uh, in here, this intensity, this is where we're dialing things up white, brighter than white. Okay? And so if I were to uh put this up here, there we go. You see it's essentially self-illuminating, but it's not it doesn't look bright, right? It's not blowing out. And so, um, this is where you can crank that setting. And if you turn that up, now it's getting brighter than bright and blowing out and then activating the glow, right? So when he hulks out later at the end of the game, you can sort of do that. Okay. Makes sense for getting your things textures back into here. Now, one word is that I hope you don't have this problem because we've talked about it, but like it's possible if you If you bring them back in and they don't line up with the character, the textures have different UVs. And so something may have happened to your UV map over here. But I think we're all pretty good on that at this point. Okay, good. So now let's come into here. And then I would put all this stuff in a folder to keep it organized, right? And so bringing those back in from Substance Painter works just fine.",

Okay. So, door logic, right? And so the here player enters trigger zone, right? And then the trigger zone. I would look at the outputs for trigger zone which I could look at the runtime. It's under input. Here we go. Might have an object here to just throw things on so I can look at the script interfaces when necessary. Be good to have a picture of these. Um, right. And so on trigger enter, on trigger stay, on trigger exit. Here the Um, enter. And this needs to be then connected to the door. which then there's a couple different ways to do this. You could do to the animator that's on the door or uh you could use the um animate script, the transform animate script. either one of those and lay this out like so. Right? So, every time something happens in your game, this is what we want to be laid out here. Right? And so, something else here we are um for uh what happens in give us a situation in your game, Kevin. uh you talk to someone. >> Okay. So, um dialogue and so the um character and let's say that this one doesn't happen automatically. You need to press a button. And so in those cases, right, our triangle or north or Y u button are going to be the ones that actually uh are set up for the interaction at this point. And so the idea is that we would have um that button essentially become active once you enter the zone. And so the zone um uses a um set active bull. The one that we've been using to just simply turn things on and off for the button press, which is going to a um event which then starts the dialogue. If you can look through the scripts and understand right where do I find the specific events they're always here at the bottom the outputs right there is no way to expand this they're all there all times right the inputs would be things that are appearing in this menu once we add them in. Um, if we were to look at this, so dialogue is kind of all in one thing at this point. If we clear this out, right? So, so we'll have some dialogue that appears here when we press a button. We'll just use spacebar for now. Spacebar sends this event. Let's get a second one here. This is essentially the thing for handling trigger the dialogue. Second, I would put these in separate game objects. So, here's a dialogue instance. And if we look over here, action dialogue sequence, this is fairly handy. So, what's going on here is that we can um set up a bunch of interactive dialogue lines. So, if we look at this Here we go. Um, so each sequence of dialogue can have its own thing here and under dialogue lines unfold. And then there's a strct which we can start putting together. And if you unfold here, you'll see that it has a bunch of stuff. Is this um on the left or the right? And what is the person what is the thing saying? And so here, hello. And on the left and here we'll have um I'm going to go ahead and take this PNG and change it to a sprite and apply. Come back to the dialogue here and bring this in under sprite. I'll make sure the sprite package is there so you don't have to do this step. It doesn't recognize there is sprite because it doesn't have the package in. And there we go. There's somebody who's going to talk. All right. And save. There we go. And so now back to here, we should be able to There we go. And that's the first part. Uh, how long is this on screen? We'll say 3 seconds. Next one, we could have a response. What? And this one will be on the right. And this one we'll use our other person here. Again, it's a sprite. And again, >> that's Mr. >> That's like his much more handsome older brother. That's why Mr. Perman acts like Joe Peshy. the brother's name. >> Sure. >> Okay. And so our logic, this is a button to trigger the dialogue or a key. Just sending an event. This event could come from entering a trigger zone. It could come from pressing a button. It could come from whatever. Um, but who do we need to talk to? We need to talk to the dialogue. And we come to the action dialogue sequence. And the conveniently named I hope start dialogue. Um what should happen? And so now if we hit this and hit play. Hello. But and to avoid those kind of embarrassing problems uh with there's a lot of options here. I tried to really think of making this flexible. So, we have our timing, how long each thing is on screen, what they're saying. This list is an array, which means you can just keep expanding it for each sequence. The uh it can loop or not loop. It can animate in in different ways. So, there's slide up, fade in, but more importantly, we need to make sure this stuff fits on the screen properly. And so here 16 by9 and then we can say show canvas preview which should uh show us this dialogue line. And so now we should be able to move the uh images. There we go. To where we would want them. Scaling them proportionally. There we go. And that looks nice. Let's edit line two, which or line one. Remember, we start at zero. Mr. What? There it goes. Right about there. And right about there. And right about there. Okay. And then you just say hide preview. And so that's still there in place. And so let's try it again. So this looks a little bit better. And when the dialogue sequence is finished, you guessed it, if you wanted something else to happen at that point, right after he says what, everything blows up. And so you would have the on dialogue complete plus game object that has a particle system of an explosion that is starts that emits, you know, a 100,000 explosion particles after that guy's like, \"What?\" >> Yes. >> Where did you get that image specifically of that guy? >> That was that was just from pixels. Okay, >> I'm gonna include >> Right. So, the whole everything in this folder, the event game toolkit is set up to go to link things together using these linked to this, right? And so these are the inputs, right? Um on whatever it is that we're working with here. Start dialogue, stop dialogue if you had to interrupt it for some reason, so on and so forth. there.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 05, 2025 Terrain Tools and World Building and here when you're gray boxing, just think about the just general profile of what's going on, right? We don't need to go in and do a whole bunch of detailing right now. In fact, I would come in and once you're in the terrain object, um we have our tools and in here our general one. Um, is this the soft brush? You see that this um gives us more. Where is the brush stuff? There we go. I would go ahead and grab the softer one. There we go. and scale this up a bunch. Not that much. Not that much either. And this is touchy slider. Okay. Um what is it? Alt or shift. Yeah. And so uh click is go up in world space. So it kind of saves you from yourself. What can you not do here? You cannot make a cave by default. You can't like punch a hole in this. Okay. No caves. Um shiftclick pushes it down. I think I have two of them here or something. Um, and uh, in addition to these brushes here, there's some rockier things. And so you can sort of play with this. Again, it looks really small or when I'm way way way out there. But, um, the thinking about what's going to be happening in, you know, do I need to have like a a messa on top of this, in which case I can sort of play with some of my brushes there. Um, do not extrude buildings out of this. They should be separate things, objects that you gray box in there. Right? So this is just for making not a plane right um this is not for making stairs that should be a separate object as well right so th those would be something that you would model and bring in um so we just want to lay out the scope of your world now that you've got a character you're you know the other thing the third thing this week is like some of you have more work to do than others where it's like fix all the stuff for your character or continue to work on said character. Um, so that you have it in here and then you can start getting the space built around the character. And so once you have everything laid out here, very rough, right? The idea is to try and do it quickly so that you can get a a sense for how big does the space need to be so this can really inform where you can put your work for making the environment props for the game. Like what? Okay. In the past when I've had students like like, \"Okay, quick. Three props that you're going to have in your game. Make those this week.\" And then inevitably they would make those, come in, and then after they started laying out the level, they'd be like, \"Oh, I didn't really use this one at all.\" Right? Whereas now, if you have this laid out in some sort of space, I think it helps having this in place first, then the other stuff, and now you'll have your pretty character in there with all of the materials from Substance Painter. Yes. >> Uh yeah. So in your case, right, there's going to be a lot of walls and whatnot. So yeah, laying things out over there and bringing them in. the thing that you as long as you don't do a bunch of stuff and turn the objects inside out in Blender, even if it's a complicated thing, if you bring it in and put the mesh collider on it, that should at least work for the time being. Um, later you may have to make a separate mesh uh collider mesh. So, that's something like a more usable mesh. But again, keep it simple, super simple over there. Like, you know, like simple geometry. But in terms of doing that over there, if you're faster in Blender, that would be um that would be doable. >> Can we do like that back face trick where like the outside is back face and inside is real? >> Uh better stuff >> like like Yeah. >> As far as like organizing it. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For while you're working in Blender. Yeah, that's fine. Um I don't know if you want to have the camera outside like Well, yeah, for now that's fine. Yeah. >> Yes. >> How large for the terrain do you want us to because I my game is car driving. So you're driving a lot of distances. >> Yeah. I mean, so if you were having because in the terrain thing here. Yeah. So over here, create neighbor terrains. But here, let me show you the thing I told you not to do. Um. Um. >> I I try to do it like especially because remember like where where's our character here? Let me grab like like because we did scale Mr. Peppermint. Did I turn him off? Where is he? There he is. Let's come in. And Right. And so here's the world from Mr. Peppermint's view. Right. And so I think three or four of those should be enough to like probably do the job here. I mean, we'll have to work on Yeah. I mean, a lot of it depends on how fast we're going and stuff. Th this is something where people have definitely gone off the rails where like um it you know lay something out and start with three see if you can make three work and then just from a standpoint of like driving around um at make sure you're using something that's at scale like how big does that feel at that point right um and then I might do a test build just to see like that this is not going to be a huge amount of stuff because they may have changed this in the most recent versions like the terrain. Um oh look there's uh some settings that you can set to have it dynamically load the terrains which is obviously what you want if you have a really big world. Um and at one point that was a total pain, but I know there's been changes to this structure, so maybe it's better now. Maybe it just fixed maybe it just does it now. But like, uh, probably not. But, you know, give it a shot. Try three. See if you can make three feel right. And then go from there. Like, that should be a doable amount of stuff. Is this making sense? But then again, it's totally key that you do this layer ground, or else your character will not be able to jump and a bunch of other stuff will malfunction uh on the terrain. Remember, anything you want to jump off of there. And then also keep in mind that the character controller does have slope settings. And so if you're if you've made a very dynamic terrain and your character isn't able to get to a place you think it should, you know, it should stop after this amount of incline. And so you may need to adjust what's going on there. And so, you know, I'll have you lay out, you know, gray box the level and then I want you to just even if your character isn't 100% yet, just move the character through the entire space so you get a sense of like rough, it's going to help inform your player speed settings. Like, is it going to take Mr. Peppermint like two weeks to get from this building to that building? Like then I need to think about the how big these buildings are, how fast he moves, those kind of things. Regardless of what happens when we get to any of those places, like is it make sense as a place to as a world to move around it? And then when you're doing the terrain also, um yeah, we don't want to have in a lot of cases, we don't want to be falling off the edge of the world. And so a lot of I mean we've all seen this in different games before. Let's come back here to paint mode. Um you know building you know barriers here on the side to keep the player from wandering off into oblivion. >> Skyrim is better anymore. >> What's that? >> Skyrim is better anyway. Can you I haven't played Skyrim actually. I just trash it that sandwich on on on my live stream, but does I mean does it You're supposed to be able to walk over all of the planets, right? All of the thousands of procedurally generated planets. Yes. >> Oh, Skyrim. Right. Right. Right. Is this what they do in Skyrim to keep you from going into like areas like there's a big mountain or something? >> You said oblivion. >> Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. >> Multilayer. >> Yeah. All right. Now I'm Now now I'm up to speed on what's happening. >> Glad you're interested. Okay. So remember this. This is like a hu the even though you know you zoom out and it looks like a small thing, it's a big thing. So, think about that when you're putting it together. There, let me just check the comments. Yeah, brush B says brush controls are over here as well on the right uh for moving everything around. Uh yeah, and then we can make materials to paint the terrain, but we're not worrying about that right now. We're just laying things out. So, not everybody's going to use a terrain. Maybe some of you just, you know, flat ground plus buildings and other stuff, right? Just depends.",
    "transcript_segment": "and here when you're gray boxing, just think about the just general profile of what's going on, right? We don't need to go in and do a whole bunch of detailing right now. In fact, I would come in and once you're in the terrain object, um we have our tools and in here our general one. Um, is this the soft brush? You see that this um gives us more. Where is the brush stuff? There we go. I would go ahead and grab the softer one. There we go. and scale this up a bunch. Not that much. Not that much either. And this is touchy slider. Okay. Um what is it? Alt or shift. Yeah. And so uh click is go up in world space. So it kind of saves you from yourself. What can you not do here? You cannot make a cave by default. You can't like punch a hole in this. Okay. No caves. Um shiftclick pushes it down. I think I have two of them here or something. Um, and uh, in addition to these brushes here, there's some rockier things. And so you can sort of play with this. Again, it looks really small or when I'm way way way out there. But, um, the thinking about what's going to be happening in, you know, do I need to have like a a messa on top of this, in which case I can sort of play with some of my brushes there. Um, do not extrude buildings out of this. They should be separate things, objects that you gray box in there. Right? So this is just for making not a plane right um this is not for making stairs that should be a separate object as well right so th those would be something that you would model and bring in um so we just want to lay out the scope of your world now that you've got a character you're you know the other thing the third thing this week is like some of you have more work to do than others where it's like fix all the stuff for your character or continue to work on said character. Um, so that you have it in here and then you can start getting the space built around the character. And so once you have everything laid out here, very rough, right? The idea is to try and do it quickly so that you can get a a sense for how big does the space need to be so this can really inform where you can put your work for making the environment props for the game. Like what? Okay. In the past when I've had students like like, \"Okay, quick. Three props that you're going to have in your game. Make those this week.\" And then inevitably they would make those, come in, and then after they started laying out the level, they'd be like, \"Oh, I didn't really use this one at all.\" Right? Whereas now, if you have this laid out in some sort of space, I think it helps having this in place first, then the other stuff, and now you'll have your pretty character in there with all of the materials from Substance Painter. Yes. >> Uh yeah. So in your case, right, there's going to be a lot of walls and whatnot. So yeah, laying things out over there and bringing them in. the thing that you as long as you don't do a bunch of stuff and turn the objects inside out in Blender, even if it's a complicated thing, if you bring it in and put the mesh collider on it, that should at least work for the time being. Um, later you may have to make a separate mesh uh collider mesh. So, that's something like a more usable mesh. But again, keep it simple, super simple over there. Like, you know, like simple geometry. But in terms of doing that over there, if you're faster in Blender, that would be um that would be doable. >> Can we do like that back face trick where like the outside is back face and inside is real? >> Uh better stuff >> like like Yeah. >> As far as like organizing it. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For while you're working in Blender. Yeah, that's fine. Um I don't know if you want to have the camera outside like Well, yeah, for now that's fine. Yeah. >> Yes. >> How large for the terrain do you want us to because I my game is car driving. So you're driving a lot of distances. >> Yeah. I mean, so if you were having because in the terrain thing here. Yeah. So over here, create neighbor terrains. But here, let me show you the thing I told you not to do. Um. Um. >> I I try to do it like especially because remember like where where's our character here? Let me grab like like because we did scale Mr. Peppermint. Did I turn him off? Where is he? There he is. Let's come in. And Right. And so here's the world from Mr. Peppermint's view. Right. And so I think three or four of those should be enough to like probably do the job here. I mean, we'll have to work on Yeah. I mean, a lot of it depends on how fast we're going and stuff. Th this is something where people have definitely gone off the rails where like um it you know lay something out and start with three see if you can make three work and then just from a standpoint of like driving around um at make sure you're using something that's at scale like how big does that feel at that point right um and then I might do a test build just to see like that this is not going to be a huge amount of stuff because they may have changed this in the most recent versions like the terrain. Um oh look there's uh some settings that you can set to have it dynamically load the terrains which is obviously what you want if you have a really big world. Um and at one point that was a total pain, but I know there's been changes to this structure, so maybe it's better now. Maybe it just fixed maybe it just does it now. But like, uh, probably not. But, you know, give it a shot. Try three. See if you can make three feel right. And then go from there. Like, that should be a doable amount of stuff. Is this making sense? But then again, it's totally key that you do this layer ground, or else your character will not be able to jump and a bunch of other stuff will malfunction uh on the terrain. Remember, anything you want to jump off of there. And then also keep in mind that the character controller does have slope settings. And so if you're if you've made a very dynamic terrain and your character isn't able to get to a place you think it should, you know, it should stop after this amount of incline. And so you may need to adjust what's going on there. And so, you know, I'll have you lay out, you know, gray box the level and then I want you to just even if your character isn't 100% yet, just move the character through the entire space so you get a sense of like rough, it's going to help inform your player speed settings.

What are you talking about?\" I I was one of those kids. 0:22 Why doesn't In my animation class, I would always put on some ambience like very quietly until people 0:31 That was such an annoyance. I love doing that. 0:38 Yeah. Yeah. 0:54 So long. You got to savor it. That's the problem. 1:00 Yeah, you'll deserve a 1:05 metal bar every 20 seconds. But if you get if you if you're concerned about length, you can get the plastic, too. 1:12 PVC pipe. I just want something that I can gaslight people to like 1:19 that's the main goal. The metal pipe. It's too long. You can't ignore it. 1:26 What do you think about that noise. 1:32 And then someone's like, \"It's making that noise.\" And then he just like stayed there for 1:38 like a minute waiting for it. 1:44 They never get to hear it again. That's That's true gas. 1:57 I would do that here if this computer didn't. 2:02 They're lucky. I could bring my own Bluetooth speaker, but then everyone would know I have a speaker. They know 2:07 exactly what classes. You hide it in. 2:15 All right. I think I think this is working now. So, we don't send the music out. 2:21 No, I'm Canon. I'm gonna present my favorite in between. So, 2:27 you did say to not play the music in the presentation. All right. 2:35 It's before Gavin mentioned the thing of muting the thing. Muting the other thing. 2:42 So many windows. Do I need a third monitor? 2:47 I mean, he does have the the audio files returned in probably those 2:54 No, we're just not sending the music out over the live stream so it doesn't get a YouTube strike. 3:12 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think let's see how we go here. 3:17 This project is the most warm light. I really like the the warm colors of the 3:25 light temperature here. Then is the high key lighting shot which actually require 3:32 me to make a whole new scene since uh you know my 180° setup was the cell 3:41 shading style. So it didn't work well for the light this lighting assignment. 3:49 So I made this new one. And then finally is this the loy 3:57 scene which I used to like a small small story that connect this shot with this 4:05 other one here that is also low lightning. 4:13 And then here is the solid shot. 4:24 And then this is the song I choose for my music video, which is the stain by 4:29 Melendi, a Spanish singer. I picked this song because I really like the the 4:34 lyrics and the overall cal feeling of the music. I also think it matches well 4:40 with slower steel scene which will let me focus more on the composition and 4:45 lighting. And that's all for this week. 4:50 Okay, great. Yeah. 4:57 Yeah, these are good. The the high key lowkey lighting here, the 5:03 sorry, highkey. We got um the characters are lit well. I mean there's this dark 5:10 thing in the background that kind of um you know goes against that. But these 5:15 were done 100%. You got the right idea here. 5:21 Was that bat there the whole time or did it just sort of I think we saw that bat before in one of his other shots. I feel 5:28 like she's saying talk to the hand. Talk to my 5:34 Unfortunately, rigged thumb there. 5:40 Yeah, you definitely got the idea for both of them. And the zully shot turned out great. Wow, that looked really good. 5:49 Yeah, even with the um Yeah, works really well even in the different um 5:57 render environment there. Um, 6:06 did he actually give us the music? 6:17 Yeah. Oh, okay. Change the name of it. Okay. And so now if I do this and this, 6:29 we can listen to This 7:02 Okay, good. That's like right. So, again, you won't hear it on the live stream just so that you guys everybody 7:09 knows there because I'm just trying to avoid that's happening. But the we'll hear it here in class. Um, yeah. Okay. 7:17 So, that's an edit. we have like two sections of the song and then yeah the 7:24 two options two obvious options here are either since we're only doing part of it like finding a part where the song you 7:32 can sort of cut or fade it out one or the other versus just having it kind of 7:38 like weirdly edit off. So, um, it sounds like yours there with that break that 7:45 the singer has there. If you cut the music right before it comes back in, 7:50 that'd probably be a good place to end. So, that works. Um, and I mean, how long 7:57 was that? Probably around 20 seconds. Okay. So, I think you're on the right 8:02 track there. That is going to work out just fine. All right. Here's Gavin's. 8:08 Hi there, everybody. This is Gavin. I'm just going to quickly go through these things. So, we got the the three 8:15 favorite renders. This is the tungsten warm lighting. I like how this one turned out. Feels very pleasing to look 8:21 at and I like how everything's arranged. And then I like the two lowkey shots 8:28 that I did for this week. Uh I thought that it was fun using the goos. I used 8:33 the goos in both of these ones for that window pane effect. Um, and it really 8:40 sells that uh idea and it's I like the dramatic lighting of everything. And I 8:45 actually added area lights onto her pupils for that added like bit of emotion to her to make it even more 8:50 dramatic. Um, and then I I just like the warm Yeah. highlights right just when you 8:56 have any just appear right there. Highlights. Yeah, the goos look really good feeling these both have. And I like how 9:02 the goos actually work to they work well here because the the lines of the 9:08 pregnancy test are actually in the light so it leads your eye there naturally and it's just it sells the message of the 9:13 shot which I like. Here's the zali shot. 9:22 All right. And then what? Like the most recent Bachelor. 9:29 The Bachelor. The Bachelor. The Bachelor. Yeah, that's great. I mean, at first 9:34 there wasn't like a lot of stuff around him, but then we see everything warp in. So, that's great. Just so you know, it doesn't it it's 9:40 just uh the media player being weird. It's It doesn't cut like that in real in the actual video. Um yeah, this is this 9:47 worked out well. Uh I added a slight Dutch angle just to add to the madness 9:54 of it all. And I like how how it looks like he's breathing in and out. And then quickly here, 10:00 So, the song I chose is Inner City Pressure by Flight of the Concords. It's like kind of a funny song about city 10:07 life. It's kind of funky. Uh, and I just thought it would be perfect for a music video. The I like the aesthetic style of 10:14 these stills from Bune, who is an animator on YouTube. Uh, I like how she 10:19 kind of portrays cities, like how exaggerated they are and the angles. I 10:25 want to kind of try to recreate that, although maybe not as exaggerated. And I like the these kind of colors. 10:33 I kind of struggled to to figure out what I would use for the color choice, but I like I like the overall idea of 10:40 blue and blues and yellows that are in the movie Drive. So, I chose that as my color reference here. So, yeah, going to 10:47 try to do like the visual aesthetic kind of city life and then also just the 10:54 colors of um how it's portrayed in drive. So, yeah, that's that's it. 10:59 Hi there everybody. This is Gavin. I'm just gonna quickly go through these. 11:10 Cool. This is going to work. Yeah, I could see this either being, you know, these being individual flat things 11:17 or certainly creating, you know, geometry of this nature and then using a 11:24 grease pencil on it so they could move around a little bit would also be a possibility there depending on how much the camera's moving in the shots, right? 11:32 Um either one of those. And then 11:37 yeah, I mean if we're just talking about just the colors, right? Yeah, that could be applied here. But you know this is 11:47 Yeah. Yeah. The colors. But I mean like the um 11:52 applying some of the more like, you know, like optical combinations that are happening between 11:58 the colors because of the fading and everything else in, you know, as like an overlay into this 2D style would be 12:05 maybe an interesting combo of things, right? like in the dedu or however you 12:10 say his name um stuff that we looked at when we were looking at the original 12:16 grease pencil stuff. Um you know he has that grease pencil look but it's always 12:22 has that um pretty severe chromatic aberration filter and bloom on it as 12:29 well which I thought was you know gives it even even more of an ethereal look. Okay. 12:34 I will say though I was thinking 3D. Okay, awesome. 13:21 Cool. 13:36 Yeah. I'm trying to remember which 13:42 is which episode is that in? I don't even know. To be honest, I 13:47 haven't watched the show yet. Oh, really? I just saw I know this. I know a few of their songs 13:53 from the show. I do want to watch the show at some point. Yeah, that's great. Um, yeah. So, I 14:00 mean, it's kind of like the same throughout the entire section, but this one as opposed to Alex, right? This would work better to sort of like just 14:06 fade out a little bit at the end there. And that'll give you a smooth sort of out for this. But you're starting at the 14:12 beginning, so there's a clean beginning. And yeah, I mean I think the challenge here visually is just sort of trying to 14:20 create some, you know, dynamic variations along to, 14:25 you know, something that's kind of chugging along here at the same same pace, but that works. Um, yeah, I can 14:32 see that with the sort of distorted buildings and everything. Um, 14:40 something that technically comes to mind is like maybe like modeling that kind of like blocky chunky building would be 14:47 pretty easy, but then like subdividing it like a whole bunch and then you could 14:53 run some displacement into the uh material to make them lean 14:59 or distort in those sort of like geometric ways. Um, something like that. 15:06 That would be cool. Here is Nat. 15:14 Hi, this is Natalie. Want to quickly show my um three stills. This is one of my favorite ones. I just like how the 15:19 colors looked on here for the warm light. I didn't want to make it too like 15:26 warm. And then this is another one for from the 180 um shot. I just like how 15:35 like kind of like song Brutus is. Um I just like how the lighting looks here. How highlights him as well as for her 15:43 right here. Another one that I have is um the three point one. I just like how 15:52 everything looks. Um then the dolly shot is right here. It's just like a moment 15:57 of realization. It is like the living room I guess. I don't know. Um the music that 16:05 I chose is um the moment of realization like the living room. 16:11 How did you do it? 16:23 The zoom is going the opposite direction of the focal length. No, I zoomed out but then increased the 16:29 focal. I think I just zooming out too far. But but this this guy was in Blender. 16:37 Yeah, it just looks like he's not for some reason. It does flatten out his face a bit by the end of it. Yeah, you 16:43 just picked a range where it's like like the background is definitely distorting, but like his it almost looks like he's 16:48 just like 2D comped in over top because there's like I can barely see any lens distortion in his face. 16:54 Moment of realization living room. Yeah, just a very very slight amount. 17:01 No, I think I mean I think you did it right. You just somehow that was just like this incredible sweet spot of like 17:08 no very little distortion in the middle of the frame. I guess I don't know. Um the music that 17:16 I chose is um by Tyler C. It's called Ring Ring Ring. Um this is a reference that I have for 17:23 this one. I didn't really choose like a full music video. Um 17:28 I'll just show a little bit of this. The audio is off as well on um on both. 17:34 But I just really like the colors here and everything and just how vibrant it is. 17:41 Um, they made this in Blender. It's really fun. 17:47 Believe it was inspired by Persona 4. Mostly persona in general, but yeah. Um, 17:55 this reference is silly. I got this, which is mostly for the dances and the vibe. I don't know how to explain it. 18:01 Um, it's these little puppet dogs dancing. 18:07 Just the vibe here is immaculate. There's a lot of vibe. 18:12 It's mostly where like this whole idea came from. Like they're just the be like dancing in a disc type of thing. Um it's 18:20 kind of like a small story board I have. It's like here to there. Um it's nothing like too big. It's just kind of like a 18:27 general idea that I have for it. Like when the song starts um she's getting a call and then it shows more of like this 18:34 go be spinning and then She says hello again and then foot like a foot uh steps 18:42 into frame and then another hello and start dancing and then show a different 18:47 thing and then after this one is supposed to switch to something else but usually by that um the clip would end 18:53 for the song. But I think that should be everything. Um thank you. Sorry. I hope 18:59 I didn't take up too much time. Yeah, that I mean hold Oh, let's hear 19:06 the song. 19:37 This is going to happen. 19:53 Okay, I feel like the media player is just punking me at this point. What is going on here? 20:07 Turn it up. You want to play on there's not intentionally like 10 20:13 seconds of quiet at the beginning. What? Okay. Perhaps there's 20:19 unintentionally 15 seconds of quiet. You know what it did? It got the part where I didn't edit it out, but I didn't 20:49 Okay. And so we we didn't miss anything there. Like it just there's a part where you hear the phone 20:54 ringing. He says hello at least three times. Uhhuh. But that's what got cut out for some reason. I didn't put a fade in or 21:00 anything in Audacity. I don't know why they didn't. Okay. It hasn't done that to me before. 21:06 Okay. Well, go just go back and look at the Audacity edit again. Yeah. And then a fade out the end. Yeah. This song's gonna work. It'll be great. Um, yeah. I 21:13 don't know. The the I think I get what you're saying here, but the um 21:20 I mean, as I was looking at the things, the idea of like hands reaching in and like manipulating 21:28 the these guys also struck me as funny like they are 21:33 here. Oh, so this is two two the same song. This is Yeah, it's two the same song. 21:44 Does this person who who's making the monkeys dance to Tyler the Crater? They have like 45 million followers or 21:50 something on Tik Tok. 22:03 And so are you thinking that there would be look like people or Yeah, there'll be people here. There'll be people. Okay. 22:13 You could just 22:20 Yeah, I was I mean there's no low maintenance way to do 22:26 to do that. That wouldn't seem weird. 22:38 Yeah, besides having like a giant hand and then like parenting the IK controls for the fingers to the to the dancing 22:46 thing, but I mean that still seems like it'd be 22:51 a lot of of trial and error there. 22:58 The um Cool. All right. So far so good. Yeah, 23:04 that's crazy with the Zi shot that you got it with that little distortion on the face like that whatever either like 23:10 maybe the distance to the camera or something like but yeah, it looks great. 23:31 I'm gonna go with like a dictatorship kind of vibe. Here's pictures from uh My Romance. Uh here is in the middle of the 23:39 concert, they do a little execution. There's little people with bags over their heads. These little cardboard 23:44 cutouts come up. Uh there's a little countdown and then and they all die. Uh 23:51 so, uh I want those like cardboard I'm going to have like my own version of carb cutters come out from like the 23:57 ground and encircle someone. Uh, another picture to kind of like the little marly 24:03 look. Um, and then this is from the Dear Dictator music video, 24:10 uh, which I'll be making, uh, the music video for. Uh, so a lot of red, a lot of 24:16 black. Uh, and then there's that execution vibe that I'm going for. Uh, 24:22 my fa three favorite renders. Uh, the tungsten warm light. I really like how it turned out. uh the low key 24:31 um just like how sinister that is. And then I put the little 24:37 like blinds kind of noir detective but like it's a mannequin. Uh and then for my Z shot uh I named him Kyle. 24:49 And I I did uh change the lighting a little bit um as it zooms out. So that is my 24:59 assignment. Hello. This is my assignment for the week. Yeah. Awesome. And so is is this like 25:05 their own glyph thing or they made their own alphabet language. 25:13 Oh, okay. For this tour, there's actually good on 25:18 the person that made the stuff about it. 25:38 Did you include the song or No, I forgot. I clipped it on YouTube, but 25:44 then I forgot to I had it like copied onto the clipboard and I just forgot to 25:49 Okay, I can tell you the song and 25:54 I'll look it up later. What What's the name of the tune? Uh, Dear Dictator by Saint Motel. 25:59 Saint Motel. Yes. Okay. No, the 26:08 Is that right? The 26:43 Yeah. In in the morning class, Zoe's name is Zoe Kyle. And then I'm looking at your stuff and it says Z Kyle and I'm 26:52 like I named him Kyle. I was just sort of like wait what is 26:57 going on here? 27:08 I clearly know nothing about anything. Did you take this footage from the were you at the show? 27:14 Um, so that one uh was from a YouTube video. The other one is from a YouTube 27:20 video, but the one at the stage that was photo from I was there in Chicago. 27:26 Cool. Yeah. Yeah, I mean the idea of having, you know, like three 3D stuff and then like 2D cardboard cutout stuff, 27:33 you know, in the same thing, especially because I mean you could certainly, you know, given our it works stylistically, 27:39 but then you could also probably build out like the stylized environments like that if things were just flat cutouts, 27:46 you know, and then the main thing is a 3D thing. I was thinking of having it be like more 27:52 like more than just like three tones, but like more sty like that. 27:59 Because like the dictator vibes like white, black, the gray, the marble, and 28:04 then red. I could like do a little bit extra on top of that, but like limit the color 28:11 palette. Yeah. I mean, you can have as many nodes in the ramp as you want. Yeah. So, yeah. 28:22 Super. That's going to work. 28:56 Hello. Hello. Here are my renders for this week. Um, in general, I prefer the lowkey lighting because I like higher 29:03 contrast images in general. I like the vibe, you know? So, it was a little harder to do the highkey lighting in a 29:09 way I found appealing, but I tried. And here's my Zulli shot. Uh, it is what it 29:15 is. My bad. And for my music video, I chose this song for a number of reasons 29:21 such as um it sounds good. I like listening to it. I enjoy hearing it, 29:26 etc., etc. And for my references, I have a bunch of images from the good, the bad, the ugly 29:34 and convenient Google search for the color palettes and the settings. 29:41 Um, I can't explain the vision, but I have one. Okay, rest assured I have it under control 29:47 and that's all really. Hello. Hello. Cool. 29:53 These looked really great coming across Discord. Yeah, this scene definitely obviously way better. Um, with, you 30:01 know, all of our really outlined 30:06 characters. I feel like everybody gets this now like using the light to define 30:13 the silhouette of the character even in dark scenes, right? Especially in dark 30:18 scenes because and especially in animation stuff because they just drop off into just monotone, you know, 30:24 nothingness. Yeah. And this was a tall order to make this kind of lighting work for this scene. Um there but then Yeah. 30:32 and the like cool nature of the um silhouette. Yeah, like these 30:38 characters have really distinct silhouettes between this mask face thing and like the big shoulder pads and 30:44 everything. So, it all works really well. Looks really good. Yeah. So, the thing here, you know, doing a 30:53 I mean, I can imagine somebody using a zali shot in the music video. um 31:01 you know trying to make it look a little bit more you know legit. Definitely not having it ease in and ease out. Um it 31:09 seems like you know unless you're doing something where it was going to ease like a lot at the end like we were going 31:14 to really like ease into this final section. If it's if 31:20 it's a much quicker thing like it most likely is in a music video, you know, something much much closer to linear. 31:26 Um, you know, like pulling out make especially this kind of thing like think about what would happen in real life to 31:33 try and ease in and ease out of this, right? You would need to be easing the movement of the camera on the track or 31:40 the dolly or whatever and then also the pulling of of the lens at the same time. 31:47 So it's like, you know, really not in in the cards there. 31:54 But that one works, especially here, you know, bending everything around what's happening to that character 32:01 here. Let me put on the song while we look at this. 32:57 Cool. Who is that? 33:03 Rainbow Kitten Surprise. Rainbow Kitten Surprise. 33:09 I'll look that up. Yeah, that's really great. That's not the name I would have thought 33:15 made that music. 33:21 And so I mean is it outside or is it inside? Okay. 33:31 Cool. Yeah, this is a moody bar. 33:45 Have you guys been to that crazy bar in Arcadia like that has the fake train? 33:52 You're not even 21. So 33:59 yeah, 35th 45th Street. 34:04 What is the name of it? 34:20 Uh, this is it, right? 34:26 Is that part of it? Yeah. 34:32 Uh, Jen was there. I haven't been there. Like there's like three or four of these 34:39 like high high concept um establishments 34:46 all like they're on the same property. Um and they all have like this 34:55 pretty crazy amount of I mean there's a bunch of mixology happening if that if you're into that. But then um yeah, each 35:02 of the bars which you need reservations for all have their own like themes and 35:07 like one of them is a train car here and um the train there's no it's a train car 35:14 but there's no like train um and like these are all 35:19 screens that they've all synchronized to make it seem like it's you know moving and then there's you know like moving 35:25 through some strange areas but Yeah, I've heard good things. I mean, there's 35:32 not many other super high concept drinking establishments in town, but 35:39 Yes. 35:48 Did you watch this recently? 35:54 Yeah. Do you fit it in between Fast and 35:59 Furious four and five? 36:09 Too fast. Yeah, there's a joke there somewhere. 36:22 Well, his his son is in the movies. Um 36:28 Scott 36:35 Yeah, Scott Eastwood is in um I don't know, he shows up in like six or 36:41 seven or something like that. 36:46 Yeah, 67. 36:56 See, I I I don't totally I don't understand that at all. Like like when am I supposed to say that? Just whenever 37:02 whenever those two numbers come up. Don't say it. Just never never say it. Never say it. 37:07 No. It won't make me look cooler as like an old guy like saying cool stuff. Well, it's just it's not even cool. 37:15 I don't understand it either. My co-workers at work keep doing it to me though and I don't get it. 37:31 I I explained e how how did you explain that exactly? 37:38 Mainly by pulling up the image. But they were like but why like E? 37:45 Then someone else that knew what E was like E. Here's 37:51 Gage. My name is Gage and here is my lighting presentation. 37:56 Here I have one of my highkey shots that I like. Oh 38:02 yeah. So Angie says platform 18. I think the whole thing is called Century Grand. 38:07 Like the whole multiple high concept experiences 38:16 and Yeah. Okay. So, this is great like using 38:22 this here, right? Really like defining the foreground character there creates a lot of dynamic, you know, 38:28 contrast in the image. I also did. 38:34 Yeah. So maybe the the thing here like maybe there's just something giving us a 38:39 little bit of sense of like the outline of this character on this side perhaps 38:45 because again we're just dropping off into nothing over there. If we go back to this hike shot I fixed the 180 degree 38:53 camera rule here. Cool. All right. I'm glad you understood what we're trying to say there. And I 38:58 did really also like the threepoint day shot as well with the three-point 39:05 lighting in it. Yeah, that looks really good. The only I mean like really really hard shadow 39:13 there, right? Even if you want to have quoteunquote hard shadows like getting some again CG is too perfect, right? 39:20 Like um you would never be able to make that in real life. And so if you're going for this kind of rendering style 39:26 where it does look quote unquote more realistic, you just moving over that 39:31 slider a little bit to give the shadow a little bit of softness. Have my zali 39:36 shot. That's right. You had it in the last one. 39:47 See, that's what what's going on with the Miximo mascara there. She has like really 39:56 And this is the song that I'm using for reference uh for my music video. And here I have 40:05 a screenshot from John Wick in the club scene and a club scene from Blade as 40:12 well. I wanted to include some sort of like Fang character in my 40:19 um I like going to really violent clubs scene for the music video, but I haven't 40:26 gotten to that kind of complicated uh characters yet. 40:31 But I mostly just like their two color schemes that are kind of similar, 40:37 especially that kind of pinkish violet. 40:47 I have 41:06 my video for it here. 41:27 Yeah. Awesome. Right. So I mean I if yeah obviously doing a lot of work here 41:33 to figure out how can I get this kind of look that I want here right? So this, 41:40 you know, the falling in category probably not, you know, like what I would say is a style 41:46 frame in that like this is not presumably it's not a club of robots. 41:51 Um, but more of what I would put under under the category of lookdev, right? 41:57 Just really quickly, you know, I've got this concept, you know, how what would it how difficult is it going to be to 42:03 try and make that happen given this environment? Cool. Okay. And let's um 42:10 what was the other thing I wanted to say about this? Yeah, I mean it gives us a really good 42:16 sense of the the vibe here, which is great. And then 42:23 here is Gauges. 42:39 No, that's just this part again. Maybe he didn't. 42:54 Yeah, I don't think he included the actual thing. 43:16 I have a screenshot. Professional griefers. 44:09 Shortcuts all over the place. 44:44 Yeah. All right. That's part of it. And he didn't have the edit up there, but I 44:51 think that's the gist of what he was saying. Let's see what else. 45:02 Alex. Alex. There we go. 45:40 Okay. And then Angie has a tune. 46:26 Cool. 46:35 I mean, that's a good section of this. These got to be some weird sections going over the stream here, just 46:40 watching me in silence listen to music. But, um, yeah. I mean, the only thing that strikes me there is like that's 46:46 pretty long. Um, you know, pushing that 40 50 second range. Maybe once it comes 46:54 into some of those sections, maybe there's a couple bars that could be cut out or something depending on what you're doing there. But that that will 47:02 work for sure. And you had a zi shot, too. 47:25 Close. Okay, you're on the right track there. So, you It looks like the camera's moving. 47:35 but not quite zooming as much. And so the thing that's tricky here is 47:42 trying to keep the pig the same size in the frame as the movement is offset by 47:49 the Z. That's the main main issue there. 47:55 Um, so the movement is right on, but you just got to try and compensate with the 48:01 zoom that's happening. Okay. Uh, do we miss anybody? 48:08 We looked at Alex stuff, right? Yes. Yeah. Uh, 48:14 wait, we didn't look at Jack's, right? No. Okay. Well, say something. 48:29 Did you for 48:51 And did you end up rendering that in EV or cycles? EV. Okay. And did the particles increase 48:57 your render time noticeably? I don't think so. I mean, I didn't do that many. It was maybe like 49:04 10,000 on each plane. There's like three planes there. 30,000 maybe. 49:09 Yeah. So, the particles are rendered in a different way. They're sort of drawn 49:15 over there in the GPU. So, it's, you know, more efficient. 49:37 Is that chest air on the model? Yeah. 50:07 I had a lot of fun doing this. My ABC200 character for my video game class and yeah, it was really cool. I added some 50:13 sound and stuff too. Um added some film grain, made it the um 4x3 resolution and 50:19 um I thought this was really cool and uh bit of a teaser of what my game could look like maybe. But um um yeah, and 50:24 then for the uh song, so for the song, I want to do an EDM song uh by Drew, my 50:30 favorite artist. It's called Grinder Hustle. This song is actually a song that like kind of made me like a fan of 50:36 them. Um so I mean that's it's a special song in that sense. Yeah, there's a 50:41 really cool part at the end um that I think has like a very chaotic but also calm atmosphere. Like it starts 50:47 off calm and goes very chaotic at the end. So, I thought I got like a really nice um contrast there with like very 50:52 serene shots and having like go crazy like the same scene go crazy. This group, it's two people. It's a music 50:59 artist and a 3D designer 3D model, but a 3D designer made this scene for it. So, 51:04 I mean that is inspiration, but um this is the actual artist itself. Um and I wanted to have it take place in a 51:11 school. Um but I want Is this the same people responsible for the image you use as your desktop? 51:18 like detailed like a very detailed like classroom setting. Obviously that all 51:24 depends on if I can find the right like Blender kit assets and stuff and maybe make my own assets and stuff. Yeah. So these are my inspirations. Um you know 51:30 just this kind of look um which is kind of the look they they've already been doing. So um I thought that'd be cool. 51:37 Uh I don't know how difficult it'll be to kind of make um this type of like really nice looking uh lighting and 51:43 stuff, but I would definitely like to try to do that. Yeah. So, I mean, uh, I suppose this is kind of what I imagined 51:49 the environment would look like during like the chaotic part of the song. So, I was going to like have all the chairs 51:54 and stuff be calm, and then when it goes crazy, everything like flies up into the air and it's just like in all in slow-mo 51:59 and stuff and we'll see. But that that's the plan. That's everything for this week. Uh, thank you and goodbye. 52:05 So, when you pick something that's already in kind of like music video form like this, 52:10 there's no music video, just that image. Just that image, that's all. These are just other like that's other artwork for other songs. 52:16 Yeah. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. I mean, just um find some way to put your own stamp 52:22 on it besides you know just I mean obviously there's a lot to be learned from trying to hit the mark of making it 52:28 look this good looks great, right? Um but you know what what other what else 52:34 can you contribute creatively there? I mean the stuff where you know there's some sort of the 2D things comped in or 52:43 not comp. I mean just depends like the these kind of things with the grid of 52:49 stuff. Um but yeah I mean just trying to think how you know like what what can 52:56 you do to sort of give it your own your own twist there while trying to to learn something from that. 53:02 What what was the name of the group? Drew. Drew 53:08 D. Yeah, I think I got it. I'm just waiting for the 53:27 whole grind [ __ ] 54:04 Oh, okay. I see it. 55:00 ABC240. Cool. That's great. 55:09 None of your none of your other classrooms have subwoofers. 55:14 Uh, yeah, that'll be awesome. You say drulu. 55:20 Yeah, it's Dutch. Oh, okay. It's like Yeah. There's probably some other like mouth 55:25 consonant things in there. I can't even do right. No, I think it's pronounced just like 55:31 Dulu. Just Dulu. Okay. 55:47 And then uh Angie says uh Jack's animated sailor character actually looks like Jack. That's because Jack took a 55:53 picture of his own face and put it on put it on the uh animated character that he just sort of downsampled it. Looking 56:00 at it that time there is a lot of like color noise in the down sampling like 56:05 you might depending on I mean it might be worth going back and I mean you just saved it at a lower 56:11 resolution, right? Like is that how you down sampled it? I did that but I also like crushed on the amount of colors. 56:17 You did smoosh it. Okay. All right. And I can change that too. Like it's Yeah. I nothing was destructive. So 56:23 cool. Then over here I found that presentation 56:32 that I wanted to show everybody or at least parts of it and I think it's super useful. 57:07 Okay. So, I'll put this link in there. Turns out all of the past presentations 57:12 have been archived on this one site. Um, so, uh, a couple things to write down 57:19 when you're looking for things in terms of other content. um like 57:26 databases full of amazing talks. The yearly computer graphics conference is 57:32 called just want to get it right sigraph I've been I don't know 57:37 twice three times um and so 57:43 silicon something graphics it's a really obtuse acronym it's barely an acronym anyway 57:50 sigraph is what everybody says they have their own 57:55 uh YouTube channel and online repository there's both like a publicly facing one 58:01 um uh and it's like the worldwide organization the big cigar conference 58:10 is mostly goes back and forth between Vancouver and Los Angeles in opposite 58:16 years but then every not every but like a lot of other continents have their own 58:22 uh respective cigraph conference there's like sigraph Asia sigraph Europe um and so there's a lot of great talks there. 58:29 Um not only the talks that are associated with the and presented by the conference itself, but all these things 58:36 work that there's you know the accepted conference presenters. These presentations are usually happening in 58:42 some sort of you know uh convention center and or hotel presentation room of 58:49 some kind. And then in addition to that, most of these conferences have like a show floor where companies and uh 58:58 software designers and production companies have booths of varying degrees of complexity. And then a lot of them 59:04 those boo like calling it a booth is like it's like a whole temporary popup 59:11 store, huge uh with their own stages and presentation areas. And so this was part 59:17 of the Cinema 4D presentation at these um at this series of conferences. The 59:23 other one is NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters 59:29 Broadcasters. Um that happens every year. I believe 59:34 it's still always in Vegas. Um and all of the companies also have a 59:42 whole bunch of presentations there at all times. they also have their own online repository of stuff. Um, a lot of 59:49 these things the going to the conference as like a 59:56 regular citizen is under most circumstances prohibitively 1:00:01 expensive. Um but almost all these associations have uh student 1:00:07 uh you can belong as a student and when you do that um some of them I'm pretty 1:00:14 sure this is the case with SIGRAP if you volunteer at the event you get free entry into the event which is you know 1:00:21 if you just buy a pass as a regular person uh it's like $2500 or I mean probably 1:00:29 more now that's a lot. Um, and 1:00:35 what was the other one I was thinking of? 1:00:41 The other great source is um the GDC, the gamedev uh conference which 1:00:50 every year is in San Francisco. uh they have both an amazing amount of talks 1:00:58 archived on YouTube and then on their own site as well and there's all of all 1:01:05 of these have like you know publicly available ones and then you know if you're a member there's an additional 1:01:10 area where there's all of the stuff from the conferences which is a lot. Um, so 1:01:17 these are all stuff that does not get floated to the 1:01:23 top by the YouTube algorithm much at all. But in terms of like the qual like 1:01:30 if you're presenting in one of these conferences you have applied a bunch of people have applied and a panel of 1:01:37 industry experts have selected this select people to present and so the 1:01:44 quality of information here even if it's not how to do this in blender just sort 1:01:50 of the general artistic and technical knowledge is very high for all of these 1:01:56 Right. Um so great especially SIGRAPH and GDC have focused a lot more recently 1:02:03 on like uh student portfolio reviews um a lot of things like that where a lot of 1:02:10 really useful information about the current state of the industries and what people are doing and um 1:02:19 yeah in addition to all of the artistic and technical stuff. Those are the three 1:02:25 main ones that come to mind. Um, more designminded stuff is um, FITC. 1:02:36 I have no idea what that acronym stands for. That's more of a design uh, conference, but I'll show you the one 1:02:42 title sequence from that. That was really great. So yeah, some of these more high-profile conferences are such 1:02:49 big productions that they hire like a marquee artist or team of artists to 1:02:55 make a title sequence, which is essentially a music video for just the conference, right? Like like you would 1:03:02 have for a TV show or a movie or a game, but just for the conference. Um, and so 1:03:07 one of the ones we can look at later has that. Uh, great. And so what this is is this, you know, this is an older one uh 1:03:14 from what I was talking about before uh from uh Pacific Rim the you know 1:03:19 designing the titles for um Pacific Rim here. And so uh this gentleman here is a 1:03:27 uh this is Ryan Summers who I was speaking about before. He has his own um 1:03:34 uh production company or design studio. Now 1:03:40 more or is it swerve? 1:03:47 It's like swerve or bend or 1:03:52 lift. Split like a one word. Yeah. Spilt. That's why 1:04:00 I couldn't remember it. It's not even like a word. Um 1:04:05 uh they do a bunch of like really really high quality motion graphics and 1:04:10 animation stuff. Um and yeah, here we can play some parts of this. Uh the 1:04:18 design process here is interesting. Um I was walking there, you know, as I hit render and I'm looking at my phone. I'm 1:04:25 asking, you know, does anybody think the movie is going to be good? A buddy of mine worked on he's like, \"Yeah, check it out. Tell me what you think of the titles.\" Saw them. They're beautiful. 1:04:31 I'm walking back to if to see my renders when I come back. I'm like, man, how many people worked on it? It was really awesome. And like it was a really tiny 1:04:37 team. It was about 10 designers and 15 animators. And I literally had to stop and like hold myself up against the wall 1:04:43 because they had 10 times the amount of people we had to try to get their opening and closing titles done. And uh 1:04:48 we had a lot less time. I think it was about four weeks to do the whole thing. So this is actually the entire Yeah. So 1:04:55 these three guys, maybe some other people right at the time. Everyone here works at Imaginary Forces with the 1:05:01 design studio. Um, and they're pitching Giomod Toro on the original Pacific Rim, 1:05:07 the first Pacific Rim titles tool lights. There's a couple bounce 1:05:12 cards, which is basically a fancy word for a plane with a circle gradient on it that you can actually just place to just 1:05:17 highlight some reflections. Um, but that was the only way we could go and just hack stuff down to actually be able to get something out really fast. And it's 1:05:24 kind of the underwhelming or underlined theme of this whole thing is how much can you get with as little as possible 1:05:29 to be able to knock this stuff out. So, okay. So, this is actually from the presentation deck that we sent to Gummo 1:05:36 for our first round of uh just review. So, we took uh those renders and we 1:05:41 created the first concept which we call the graphic novel. And the idea was really to take these renders and to put 1:05:46 them into some really basic environments, but we wanted to create some photographic uh feelings and look 1:05:52 by using depth of field, by using some light glows. And uh we just took these models and put cameras in interesting 1:05:58 places. Like this is actually a shoulder blade from one of the Jagers. And we were able to just create these really 1:06:03 interesting looking uh compositions. Uh again, the lighting is just that one big soft box. to put some other soft boxes 1:06:09 on the side and we just thought we'd create these very, you know, explosive comic book moments and um as we're going 1:06:17 through here. So that's right. So style frames, right? 1:06:22 This is part of in in this case when they're pitching him, you'll see this one and a couple other they did a couple 1:06:29 style frame decks were like what about this style or what about this style or what about this style? And so important 1:06:34 not only to like nail down what everybody wants to see, but you know they're doing it in an environment 1:06:41 that's close enough to the production environment where this will help in terms of like actually setting up the 1:06:48 actual output later on. Uh a concept that we initially just imagined and we thought of and we 1:06:53 presented to GMO and he really loved these. He really thought that this was a completely different take of how to see 1:06:58 those designs. He says, \"Oh, the sexy robots.\" Yeah. And he he just kept wanting to call him 1:07:04 the sexy robots. G's pretty awesome because like we came with our nice like designer names for like graphic novel or I forget Neotokyo. 1:07:11 And like Gimmel's a big dude, a big like amazing guy. And he's like sexy robots. And we kept on looking through and we're 1:07:16 like, \"Oh, we're going to show these other ones that you'll see some of them.\" But he was always like, \"Uh, just go back to sexy robots. I want to see sexy robots again.\" It was just like, so 1:07:23 for the rest of the project, all of our cool names just turned to make the robots as sexy as possible. And again, 1:07:28 we understood that we the audience would have been seeing an entire, you know, two-hour film full of ILM rendered 1:07:35 textured, you know, rigged robots. So that we didn't want to do that. We want to do something that's completely different. We want to do something 1:07:41 that's very sleek and minimal and stylized. Uh so this was the solution that we came up with. Uh so here are 1:07:47 some of the other directions that we pitched for the main tiles. We also did a version just using a simple mograph 1:07:52 rig and a shader to create this sort of topological map. And this map basically 1:07:58 would serve as a device for us to just go through different title cards. Uh this is actually a screen grab from that 1:08:04 rig uh that's set up in cinema. And uh we thought at some moment it would be really cool if the rift started 1:08:10 opening to you know signify the Mariana Trench. Did I say that right? Mariana. I always call it Marinara Trench. 1:08:16 Marin. Yeah. I always say that too. which GMO kind of likes but it's I think it's Marianas trench 1:08:22 I don't know I actually got it right this time Mariana I always get it wrong so we just you know thought of this idea 1:08:28 there wasn't a lot of you know development in terms of the story but we just presented to him and he actually 1:08:34 really loved this concept too and this eventually evolved into what is now the main title uh reveal for the film 1:08:40 yeah how many people have seen Pacific Rim I hope a few people have seen it yeah so you know that moment where Pacific Rim comes in and there's a huge 1:08:46 sound queue and everybody kind of cheers in the movie. That wasn't in the movie at all. It wasn't even supposed to be there and it just actually kind of came out of 1:08:52 this one where he hesitated for a second. He's like, \"That would be cool too, but we can't do two main on ends. Can we do something with this?\" 1:08:59 Yeah. And this was all done with physical render very quick. Uh in addition to the 3D concepts, we 1:09:05 also uh took the models and did some really quick sketch and tune renders. And we also 1:09:11 So sketch and tune was the Cinema 4D version of like a grease pencil kind of thing. added some lighting to make some 1:09:18 frames out of those models which look kind of like this. And the idea behind 1:09:23 these frames were that we wanted to take uh the geometry and some of the schematic drawings that were provided 1:09:29 for us and to create this very almost like draftsmanlike look at the building of the Jagers. Yeah, there's a there's a 1:09:36 funny story about these two that I hopefully uh Chip's not watching, our owner, but uh the brief was so tight and 1:09:41 was so short that like the original idea was just put type over some of the art that they already gave us. Like if you 1:09:47 know Gimmel Del Toro, the guy loves concept art. He loves building stuff. He makes more art than you'll ever see in the movie. So the original brief was 1:09:52 like just put some cool design type over some cool images. Let's get in, let's get out, let's go home. And then when we 1:09:58 drove in um one of them, right? So if you're making style frames for a motion picture, then it's concept 1:10:03 art, right? Same idea like how close can we get to what the final thing is on 1:10:09 screen without going through the entire going through ideally some sort of like much shorter process and much more 1:10:15 flexible process to work out the details of what we want to see and 1:10:21 what we don't want to see right because just like with you know especially with any movie with a lot of VFX or an 1:10:27 animated film you know if you change something about the final look you may have to change a whole bunch of the 1:10:34 workflow in order to get to that final look in some sort of like reasonable fashion. Our owners actually I didn't think actually had seen this at the time and 1:10:40 actually called us halfway in when you see the whole presentation book and pulled us off the road and said like are you guys sure you want to try to submit 1:10:47 this? Do you think you can actually get any of these done in the amount of time we have? Cuz that's totally beyond what we thought the scope of this project was 1:10:53 going to be. But the strength of everything that you're seeing right now, I don't know how many people do this, but almost all these boards that Miguel 1:10:58 designed originated in cinema. He's creating actual production art for the style frames that if any of these got 1:11:04 green lit, you could literally go and just start working that day that million different sources. It's actually stuff 1:11:09 that at least for some of these we could start the next day right away running. So we were really confident that what we knew with cinema we were designing to a 1:11:17 brief in terms of amount of time. That's one of the things that we really leveraged being able to use cinema just building frames in the actual program. 1:11:23 Oh, and in case it wasn't mentioned, the scope of the project was that we had to do a two and a half minute main on title 1:11:29 sequence in stereoscopic 3D at 2K resolution. We would have one and a half 1:11:36 months. Yeah. And I get one animator. And when I asked my producer, what does that mean? I get 1:11:41 one animator. It means I get to animate and I get an animator. No, you are that one animator. Mhm. So, 1:11:47 the fact that GMO liked that second concept and that evolved into a main title sequence gave us a little bit more 1:11:53 of a budget. You get one animator, you so that we could bring on a couple more team members and uh 1:12:00 yeah, you you'll see some of the other designs like this one. This was my absolute favorite. And for whatever reason, I thought I knew GMO really 1:12:05 well. I'm like 97% he's going with this one. There's no way he's not doing anything else. But we were scared to death because this one wasn't done in 1:12:11 cinema. This is all a really beautiful illustrator named uh Mitran that made this. They're stunning. These could be 1:12:16 like Mondo alternate posters for the movie. Um but we're like we're going to have to make every single one of these 1:12:22 things. So it actually turned out that I was dead wrong. Yeah, we were we were sort of covering our basis with this sequence because the 1:12:28 main thrust of the first meeting was we had to walk out of that meeting with a green light as to go into One Direction. 1:12:33 And we knew that because Pacific Rim was so manga inspired and influenced, we had 1:12:39 to at least do one homage to manga uh just to cover our bases. But this was actually the one I was the most scared 1:12:44 of that they picked because yeah, how would you animate this? You basically have to get a cell animator to 1:12:50 just come in and knock it out. But uh yeah, the they were really beautiful frames and um so GMO didn't like him because he said 1:12:56 kids don't like that stuff. Kids like sexy robots. So apparently in GMO's world, sexy robots are what? like 1:13:02 8-year-olds go for uh this is another concept. Basically, we thought, well, what if there was some 1:13:07 like war propaganda that was being put out during this time in Japan and uh this is essentially what we thought it 1:13:13 would look like. And again, a lot of that stuff's actually cinema assets just treated differently. Um 1:13:19 don't show this one. I didn't think we were showing this one. Oh, this one I I don't do boards very often, but this is my board. 1:13:24 Yeah, this is embarrassing. So, we did uh some trap code form stuff. Yeah. So, um, we I don't know if you've 1:13:31 ever seen the person. I mean, this actually looks a lot like the original Avengers title sequence here. 1:13:36 Of interest TV show. We had just rolled off of that in a similar type of like really quick turnaround. And uh, we had 1:13:41 built up a lot of techniques to really quickly create depth and atmosphere and kind of fog. And uh, I was just like, 1:13:47 I'm just going to keep building on what I did. Give me some stuff from the trailer. Like these are these are actually screenshots from the trailer. So, we did it. We started building up 1:13:53 volumes. I started trying to move a camera through to see it. was totally fine until Miguel reminded me like we still have to do this in stereo. How are 1:14:00 you going to do 80 million little dots of light in stereo? So I was actually so 3D, right? Um so when you render I 1:14:09 mean stereo referring to two Y's in this case and so um 1:14:15 you needs to be two renders, one for each eye. The way that the separate 1:14:21 images get to each eye varies a little bit depending on how it is you're viewing the thing, but you still need to 1:14:27 render those separately. Right? So the uh some for simple situations you can 1:14:35 set uh an output on the render settings to get stereo output. But then for more 1:14:44 uh intricate sort of things in order to have more control over what the apparent depth is then you need to sort of have 1:14:51 some sort of rig that manages two cameras in the 3D environment. Um that 1:14:57 you know the distance between the two cameras can help change the 1:15:03 uh appearance of depth in the stereo image. But this, you know, so this 1:15:09 whatever it said it was 2013, this is right, I would say on the upswing of 1:15:15 when people were really excited about 3D television. Um, so like all of the big 1:15:22 the other big conference, not art related, is the consumer electronic show that happens in January in Las Vegas 1:15:29 every year, and that's all the new consumer stuff. But like for that five-year period, it was all 1:15:37 there were no better screens being made. And so trying to make everything 3D was 1:15:43 the way they were going to sell everyone new televisions. But you know, like now not as much. I mean, did does anybody 1:15:49 opt into that when they go to the movies to try and see the stereo version at this point? 1:15:55 Yeah. You still release movies in 3D sometimes? Yeah. Like a handful of things come out in 3D. I mean, like not 1:16:02 as much, right? So, like this total fad uh situation. I've seen a handful of TVs 1:16:10 that do it without glasses or stuff, but 1:16:15 it's pretty limited and you have there's a very small sweet spot. Meaning, like it looks pretty good if you stand like 1:16:21 right there. Uh but then if you What's that? 3DS. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you move offaxis at 1:16:29 all, it's not not that great of an experience. But the most convincing 1:16:34 version of it that still only works for one person is having a tracker 1:16:40 and then rendering the stuff in real time. So it like figures out where your head is and then if you move and your 1:16:46 head the images the image adjusts, but that you know that like that's a bunch 1:16:51 of live compute that's happening. She really scared to even show it. So thankfully GM was like that's too girly 1:16:56 or too wispy or too it's not robots enough. So we dodged a bullet with that one. Cool. Uh okay. So then as part of the 1:17:05 presentation we just showed a lot of the graphic language that we thought could house the type and um Oh wait, you got to go back. You got to 1:17:11 go back. Are there any designers in in the audience at all? Okay. Okay. So, if you ever design for a movie for a director who's like a big big guy who's 1:17:17 going to actually be involved with the art direction, a really good tip if you like a specific design, you want him to see it before anybody else, just put his 1:17:23 name on it. Yeah. Cuz he went for I don't know if he went with that one, but I know he saw that one and I know that was one of his 1:17:30 favorites. So, it's kind of like the opposite of the purple cow theory. Like, give him his name on it. He'll at least notice it. 1:17:35 What was funny was that we presented this app. I can grab those cameras, move them around. But the real power to this, and 1:17:41 I don't know why it's set up this way in Maxon, uh, with Cinema, but if you actually start pulling these down, it took me a long time to find this. You 1:17:48 can start actually fine-tuning all this stuff. And you can go in. So like right now, footsteps are probably Let's just 1:17:55 turn off footsteps. And then this is just some of the rotation confidence check 1:18:00 camera motion rig. So basically, you know how your how your eyes work. Say if you have your finger in front of your face and you look at 1:18:07 you look at your finger with your left eye and switch to your right eye, you notice that your eyes cross. So it's a 1:18:13 good rule of thumb. When something is coming out of the screen into the audience space, your eyes are crossed. So if you're looking at your stereo 1:18:19 image and you close your left eye and that stereo image is on the right hand side and you open your right eye. So 1:18:24 here's a little bit of what the final thing 1:18:37 an extreme trying to the characters with the light, right? 1:18:44 Like none of these silhouettes would look like anything without these like really 1:18:55 and there's another section in here where they talk at length about um you know there's like one maybe two actually 1:19:02 3D lights in most of these scenes and then the rest of it is HDRs and so a lot 1:19:07 of these HDRs would look like nothing. They' just be black with like some random color and white spots in them and 1:19:14 you know just putting trying out different HDRs with that robot shape and spinning them around until it just 1:19:20 interacted with the thing, right? Because it's not HDR like a photographic one where the sun is here and if you 1:19:27 start spinning it around and you see in the background it's going to look weird. Just a bunch of highlights and colors 1:19:32 and stuff and so you can spin it around and still have it look abstract and interesting. So anyways, this whole I'll 1:19:38 you know post a link to this. This is the entire in 1:19:45 maybe not entire but like a really sizable archive of 1:19:50 um Cinema 4D um presentations at Sigraph 1:19:55 and NAB over I don't know a long at least 1:20:02 over a decade at this point. Um yeah, so a really great talk and 1:20:08 everybody's very candid there about the um progression of that project. 1:20:17 Um 1:20:23 here's another take on style framing. This is kind of a pres a progression from 1:20:29 um style frames to uh again working in a format to produce 1:20:34 the style frames that's going to be useful later on. Right? So again, the thing with the style frame is like you 1:20:40 want it to get as close as you can and just need to make calls about like where does it make time make sense to invest 1:20:47 time in maybe making an asset or two and where does it make sense to like skip 1:20:52 stuff in order to just try and get it on there, right? Um, 1:20:58 this is a much more high stakes decision when you're 1:21:03 pitching stuff in terms of like how much, you know, time and effort am I and 1:21:09 possibly my employees putting into this thing because I mean a lot of most of 1:21:15 the time people are not getting paid to pitch stuff. I mean there are people there in the last I don't know 1:21:23 seven years or so I feel like there's at least an awareness of the amount of time 1:21:29 and effort and energy goes into even pitching these things. And so in some instances, especially um 1:21:38 uh governmental agencies or uh municipal agencies, like there's been a bunch of 1:21:44 things I've applied for recently where after the first round and they decided like, oh, we would love to see what 1:21:50 these people would do with this, like they had some sort of money available to 1:21:55 pay everyone to put a pitch together, you know, because they were doing it to like I don't know, five or six people 1:22:03 and so you know it wasn't great money but it was something so that you know 1:22:08 you're not putting all this work in for absolutely zero. Anyways uh this one's I think a pretty interesting take on 1:22:14 putting this kind of look together and then arranging these 2D assets in 3D 1:22:20 space here. 1:22:32 You have to pretend like you're going to work, get ready for your day, and then you 1:22:38 literally go on a walk around the block, which is most often what I do. Maybe a 1:22:43 coffee, maybe a breakfast. Just changing my mental state. And then you get to work and it also 1:22:50 happens to be your house, but your mind has shifted. My name is Eve Weinberg. I'm a motion 1:22:57 graphics art director. Right. working on a film title sequence and end credit 1:23:03 sequence. It's a dark comedy. It's about this 32-year-old golf caddy who still 1:23:09 lives with his mother in his basement and has daddy issues and writes a 1:23:15 graphic novel about it. I was given the script and some images and I just completely fell in love with 1:23:21 it. So that's when I began generating the artwork to create style frames. A 1:23:27 style frame is basically one frame that encompasses the entire look and feel of the video. 1:23:34 I'm one of those people that's been drawing since the day I was born. I was always painting, making art, drawing 1:23:41 things. So, the golf balls are flaming, so I decided to do that with finger paints. And just by them popping on one 1:23:48 after the other, it gives like this really crude handmade animated spot. 1:23:56 So I started with these style frames and I bring it into After Effects and I have all my layers. So one by one you just 1:24:02 have to bring this scene to life and you have to animate everything just a little bit so it feels shaky. Like even the 1:24:08 camera is like kind of finding the right moment like the camera it's as if a 1:24:13 person is filming a down shot of this guy working. But yeah, in two weeks I 1:24:19 think this thing will be done. I'll work from home for two months and then I'll go into a studio for about two months. 1:24:26 So two months is when I like meet co-workers again. 1:24:31 So really cool different sort of process here. And yeah the way 1:24:36 uh yeah what they handed off to her right in in a way a lot of things would go from animat storyboard to animatic. 1:24:43 Here she her style frames were made in a way that she could go from style frame to kind of like you know then the 1:24:50 distance between animatic and finished animation for this particular project is pretty is smaller than you know like a 1:24:57 full 3D pipeline or something like that. Um yeah, I thought that one was really 1:25:02 good. Um 1:25:33 And in terms of tools for doing this, so we'll make the starframes and the 1:25:40 storyboard. uh storyboard on the timeline, you know, our sort of first step animatic this 1:25:48 week. Um, and then starting to plan things out. Uh, being able to see what 1:25:53 you're doing, thinking if your thing's going to be in 3D space. Um, how to 1:26:00 think about how much of how much of the space you need to build. Um, 1:26:05 and that obviously varies a lot, right? Um, 1:26:10 in our situation where one person is working on it, you want to build just enough. You don't want to be constructing these whole things and that 1:26:15 you're never going to use. But in some of the bigger situations like the Ready Player One, which is essentially 1:26:22 completely animated, there's a handful of like live action things, maybe mostly 1:26:28 animated. Um the they did a bunch of things beforehand 1:26:37 in order to be able to be in the space and they used VR headsets for this. Um 1:26:45 and so Spielberg could sort of like wander around the virtual space and find 1:26:50 the shots that would become later. And so this here this when does this movie 1:26:55 come out? Like at least seven or eight years ago. This is sort of at the very front of that. And now there's even more 1:27:01 of this where things that we would associate with like postp production where you would shoot a character 1:27:07 against a green screen and then later somebody would make a whole bunch of stuff that would fill in the background. 1:27:12 That's becoming kind of flipped now at this point, right? The Mandalorian 1:27:17 famously filmed against, you know, the big volume screen. And so a lot of what 1:27:23 used to be the post-production of like making the 3D environments is now pre-production. They do all that 1:27:28 beforehand so they can be on the screen. It has to be on the screen when they shoot it so that they are able to, you 1:27:34 know, it's not being comped. It's like in in camera at that point. Um, and so 1:27:41 that allows for I mean every I I'll I don't have one up here, but I'll link to 1:27:46 a couple of the things. You know, the Mandalorian every and all the things they're shooting against the volume, the 1:27:52 big screen now, they talk about all the actors are like, \"Wow, this is really really great.\" because like I can see 1:27:59 stuff as opposed to just I'm against this green screen and there's a guy holding a tennis ball and I need to act 1:28:05 like that's a monster and you know um like you know I'm not an actor but like 1:28:11 that's clearly a compromised situation. And so now being able to see all that stuff and the flexibility like if they 1:28:16 shoot something and they're like, \"Oh, that rock's in the wrong place.\" Then you just go into the 3D software and move the rock over like like we would 1:28:24 afterwards, but you can do it beforehand. So like this really cool combination. This is super easy in 1:28:30 Blender. It's like practically built in at this point. So I'll bring all the as we start to build out the environments 1:28:36 next week for this project. Um, we'll have all the VR headsets and we can hook 1:28:43 them up because it's lit just to just to look at your Blender file in VR is just 1:28:49 a couple clicks. It's not a huge rigor role. Um, it doesn't let you move stuff 1:28:55 around and create there in that view, but you can look at it that way, which I 1:29:01 think is super useful. And the other, it's not I don't think it's in this video. I don't remember them talking 1:29:07 about it, but he um really wanted to drink coffee while he was in virtual 1:29:12 reality, but he couldn't see his cup or his mouth. So, they ended up making a tracking marker for his cup so that it 1:29:19 would show up in virtual reality and he wouldn't spill coffee on himself. 1:29:25 Yeah. I mean, it's the kind of stuff you can do if you're Steen Spielberg, you know. 1:29:39 And another resource here in terms of the 1:29:44 uh transition uh you know previsualization. This is a 1:29:50 there's a bunch of really good stuff on the Pixar YouTube channel. This is one of them. This is 1:30:00 There we go. sort of storyboard to, 1:30:06 you know, sort of a, you know, we kind of skipped animatic there and went to, 1:30:11 you know, a level of previsualization where, you know, we're blocking out the shots. You know, like obviously all of 1:30:18 the characters are going to get bespoke walk cycles later or just sort of sliding around. Here's the one, you 1:30:25 know, if you haven't seen the movie, there's like all these carnations carnations, right? carnation pedals on the ground here. And so like a giant 1:30:31 particle effect, some of you may also have particle effects in your thing. And 1:30:37 besides even in the style frame, the style frame, I would I would fake the 1:30:42 particle effect by comping in something at this point in 2D. Right now 1:30:48 is not the time to devote to the part. Even in Pixar here, like there's not the time to devote to the particle effect. 1:30:53 It gets layered in at the very very end. 1:31:01 There we go. 1:31:15 So a lot of great stuff there with that's one of the one where we could sort of see very specifically the 1:31:21 transition between those things the you know moving storyboard there animatic 1:31:27 into different levels of previs 1:31:34 Um 1:31:40 here 1:31:49 uh so this is uh yeah I mean this one really really 1:31:55 really close. Uh these are style frames for the Spider-Man 2 video game. 1:32:04 um end credit sequence. Um and 1:32:10 yeah, doing something different, you know, and for a lot of these either 1:32:16 completely animated, you know, computer animated or um you know, movies that you 1:32:24 don't think of as animation but are like completely computerenerated like Ready Player One. Um when they make the title 1:32:29 sequence, there's a big artistic hurdle there in terms of like 1:32:35 well we can't just make a cool looking CG thing because the whole movie is a cool looking CG thing right so what are 1:32:40 we going to do artistically that's separate from that and so this is one of those cases right like it's a video game 1:32:46 that I don't know hundreds if not thousands of people work on and so there's you know really really high 1:32:53 fidelity and so what could you do that's sort of separate from that um and so 1:32:59 that's the um 1:33:04 style frames and this is the actual thing. 1:33:15 There we go. So, another good example of like 1:33:21 certainly um 1:33:27 Pacific Rim uh situation. Uh we have definitely some 3D models and then 2D 1:33:35 assets comped into uh the 3D space. 1:33:44 So, lighting or applying shaders that are 2D in quality. And then, 1:33:54 you know, they're they also chose to make these things pretty freeze framed, right? And so, instead of something like 1:34:00 this being a long period of particle trail wrangling 1:34:06 to get this to happen, this is just like a drawn asset that is laid in over top. 1:34:13 And you know, same thing with all this like symbio goo or whatever else is happening here. 1:34:19 But um yeah, this is I mean when I was looking at other things to show you guys, I was surprised about I mean maybe 1:34:28 that post I showed you of the style frames was like somebody's Instagram post of who worked on this. So there 1:34:34 might have been some, you know, uh, Monday morning quarterbacking there in 1:34:39 terms of like here's some, you know, here's some style frames, otherwise known as renders from the final thing, 1:34:44 you know, like where, you know, what how much of this was actually done beforehand, but um, yeah, 1:34:54 and then, you know, much more modern treatment for the camera movement here in terms of the the camera's always sort 1:35:01 of slowly moving and then we have these ramps where we ease in and ease out of them. 1:35:08 It's really good. The 1:35:27 Another 1:35:42 nice uh comparison of a scene where we see, you know, essentially just raw 1:35:48 storyboard frames, some more fleshed out, you know, in this case colored kind 1:35:53 of animatic thing and then a level of the uh previs here at the end, right? 1:36:00 And so in a lot of especially in this case, you know, this ends up being like 1:36:07 a, you know, like a Blender viewport render of the scene, you know, with all 1:36:12 of like the very temp movement. Um, so 1:36:18 there's not the first person to be doing this, right? like the car is going to move across here in order to get 1:36:25 the like what's going to need to happen here? How much ground is someone going 1:36:31 to cover in this much time in the shot? Because all that would massively affect like the sort of, you know, walk run 1:36:37 animation that needs to happen there. So figuring that all out beforehand is 1:36:42 um critical. 1:36:49 But here in this narrative context, there's a much more there's a much higher bar in terms of like getting 1:36:55 everything some sort of correct temporal sequence of what's happen. It's like 1:37:00 this needs to happen, this needs to happen, this needs to happen. For the music video, things can be a little freer in that instance, right? like 1:37:07 we're gonna storyboard this out to the timeline, but in no way later. I mean, 1:37:14 maybe we could do something like this where you just sort of show what it was, what you planned and what you did, but 1:37:20 it's a much much freer format in terms of you find some other shots while you're making it and you mix those into 1:37:27 the stew while you're doing the music video there in terms of the editing. Um, that would be super important. 1:37:36 And um yeah, this was on the Blender site. 1:38:02 So somewhere in between previs and style frames. This is for uh the most recent 1:38:08 or not maybe the most recent Blender. 1:38:31 There you go. So the Blender scene that we 1:38:38 unsuccessfully tried to load earlier in the semester uh comes from their you know now they have Blender Studios 1:38:44 that's making um products with the tool. And so you recognize this guy when we 1:38:52 saw him for just a few seconds as Blender crashed um trying to load some of these scenes. Um and so this is uh 1:39:02 charge. I'll link to the whole thing here to look at it. But um this is part 1:39:08 of the you know style frames pitch frames for charge right. So obviously 1:39:15 these were done, you know, I imagine in Blender as like these really really crude um simple versions of the main 1:39:24 story beats from the entire narrative here. really focusing on the change in, 1:39:29 you know, color, tint, and quality and, you know, framing of the shots. And um 1:39:38 yeah, I thought this was, you know, maybe not quite style frame in that the 1:39:44 end product here ends up being way way more, you know, detailed and high fidelity than what we're seeing, but 1:39:51 successfully communicating um you know, the look and feel and 1:39:58 narrative structure and main visual landing points for the entire project 1:40:04 there. This was uh yeah I thought really interesting 1:40:15 then 1:41:30 Yeah. Okay. I think that was that was the main ones I wanted to show everybody there. 1:41:50 So, two things there from looking at those examples 1:42:02 from just implementation kind of thing. looking at some of this the 1:42:10 there's a lot of like concert slash um 1:42:19 club lighting stuff. And in terms of establishing some of that for the 1:42:28 style frames at least um 1:42:33 something al along these lines as a setup to do that kind of stuff. I 1:42:39 mean, we want some sort of big controllable volume. 1:43:01 Um, let's label this one. 1:43:10 So going towards creating some sort of art direct space uh to create that kind 1:43:15 of lighting. Uh I might 1:43:52 And let's save this. 1:44:09 And then let's bring in some lights. 1:44:17 And let's constrain the lights with the damp track and a actual 1:44:25 object. There we go. Going to move this down. And so our spot here 1:44:36 to our target light. 1:44:42 And here. 1:44:54 Cool. Let's save that. Let's see what it looks like. 1:45:00 And make this look something like what we want. 1:45:17 I think the volume needs to be a bit a little bit bigger. 1:45:28 And let's get rid of the other light. There we go. 1:45:33 All right. And so in here the spot 1:45:54 All right. And so let's have some sort of stage. 1:46:17 And so now with this in place, 1:46:22 something along the lines of here and then 1:46:29 saving and shift D, shift D, shift D, shift D. 1:46:40 All right. And coming back and down in here 1:46:53 for multiple things in Blender, the trick is holding down 1:46:59 alt when you drag. And so if you have multiple things 1:47:05 selected and you hold down alt when you drag, as long as they're the same thing, you can change it for all of the things 1:47:11 at the same time. So I can change all of these spotlights simultaneously. 1:47:17 And then the um other thing here for this like club 1:47:26 concert setting kind of thing. A lot of times the stage lighting has multiple different colors 1:47:33 and being able to mix those things up. Also having some sort of principled volume here might be 1:47:43 uh volume noise. But 1:48:05 the quality of what's going on here is going to be a lot of what's going on with the render. If we look at the EV 1:48:13 stuff here under 1:48:52 Uh, I'm going to do the the trick I was talking to Jack about earlier before. I'm going to flip the normals on this 1:48:57 cube. 1:49:31 Okay. So, now we can see a little bit of what's going on. Um, 1:49:39 if this is crashing the EV render, coming up here and doing the viewport 1:49:46 render image, there's been some instances where that crashed for me, but this did not. And so, especially in EV 1:49:53 where the viewport is going to be very close, that's going to help and may also 1:49:58 address some of the crash issues. But here, 1:50:04 right, this is EV doing the super fast version of the light bouncing around. 1:50:10 And so the sup what makes it super fast is number one, this setting right here, 1:50:16 it's only doing it for half as many pixels by default. And so 1:50:22 um you can if it's chugging, this can be even less. And you see what happened 1:50:27 there? see how noisy all of this junk gets right away, right? But now it's 1:50:33 like super fast um and easy to move around. But then when it comes time to, 1:50:39 you know, make the best looking one for the render, I can bump it down. Remember, by default, it's one to two, 1:50:45 but one is going to make it as good as it will be there. Um the rays is how 1:50:52 many times we're going to how many rays we're going to shoot. And then steps is how many times that's gonna bounce. And 1:50:59 so if that's like a one or actually can I put it at zero? Does it let me put it at zero? I don't think you wouldn't want 1:51:05 to do that. So you see that this wall is like way way way darker because it's really just 1:51:11 being ellipt. 1:51:21 We get the light coming down, bouncing, bouncing, bouncing. And so the you know just more and more photons accumulating 1:51:27 hitting the thing there. Um over here if this is a little bit higher 1:51:36 we have a little bit more a little bit softer. These are all super 1:51:42 sharp. So again I'm going to grab these and 1:51:58 soften that up quite a bit. And not only for posing the thing, but 1:52:05 also moving stuff around. Having these multiple lights hooked up to this one 1:52:11 target now allows me to do, you know, stage andor light animation here. Club 1:52:18 animation of this moving around. Where'd it go? There it goes. Right. So, again, I'm just they every light has a damped 1:52:25 track on there. They're all pointing at the one thing. And so, yeah, for your 1:52:30 dead mouse thing, like so. Um, 1:52:38 the 1:53:10 and then if we turn the volume back on kind have to balance the thickness of 1:53:17 the volume with the brightness of the lights. So, if we want to have a stronger light 1:53:24 beam there, and then we need to have um we want a more evident one, we need 1:53:32 to make this thicker, but then offset it over here. So, grabbing all of these and 1:53:39 being able to dial this up. 1:54:08 One of them I set way out of bounds. 1:54:30 So, as long as we're in EV here, we're getting like I mean, you could package 1:54:35 up this whole thing now as its own, you know, asset and use this 1:54:43 throughout the project or use multiple versions of it throughout the project. 1:54:48 If we look at how something would fall into this light here. 1:54:59 So, a lot to balance there between the actual volume and the lights. Um, 1:55:07 yeah. And then being aware of this over here, 1:55:13 how much work we're actually doing. 1:55:20 The threshold is like the threshold at which uh it stops working to resolve the 1:55:26 noise. And so, um, 1:55:31 by far the biggest effect is going to be how much resolution there is. And then if 1:55:37 everything's really chugging, definitely dialing that around so you can look and 1:55:42 move around in a much more effective way with what you're doing there. 1:55:51 So the other if we had something like 1:55:57 the Spider-Man situation here, 1:56:03 let me make a camera. 1:56:11 Look through said camera. Delete the other camera. 1:56:18 Delete it. There we go. Grab this one. Look through this. Control on Z. 1:56:26 There we go. Um 1:57:17 So I would make a new plane 1:57:26 and then like let's say this is going to be a 2D asset that we use you know in 1:57:31 the style frames and then something is going to be uh part of the project later on like this. We'll call this like 1:57:39 essentially kind of like a sprite here. Um but if we did the same thing with 1:57:45 this the damped track here. Um but let's point it at 1:57:51 the camera. And 1:57:57 there we go. And so now if I were to scale this down, tab S. 1:58:09 There we go. Tab. And so if I look through the camera here, zero. 1:58:16 And stay looking through the camera. 1:58:49 So this stays pointed at our camera. 1:58:57 We have the flipping which is not great. I thought I remember this having like an up vector. Is that the other one? Damped 1:59:04 track. Locked track. 1:59:54 Now we can solve it in a simpler way. So if you had a 2:00:09 axis, so just an empty. 2:00:20 And let's make this the point at camera. 2:00:26 And then this gets a damped track to 2:00:31 the camera. Take our sprite and shift drag it 2:00:38 underneath this. There we go. And 2:00:43 does our sprite still have the constraint? No. Okay. And so if we were to move around, that's moving. 2:00:51 We can take the sprite and rotate it relative to what's happening 2:00:59 in order to compensate for any weirdness that's happening there. 2:01:18 And so later once you apply things, you could move 2:01:29 this as it's staying flat to the camera moving around. Let's apply 2:01:37 a splatter or some sort of 2D effect to it. So on this one, if I grabbed a new 2:01:43 material and brought in something with an alpha channel of any kind 2:02:45 There we go. 2:02:53 So, kind of being able to put these two to 3D things around. So, if this moves, 2:03:00 I can move the camera. Still kind of stays flat to the camera. I can manage the rotation as a child object here if I 2:03:07 want it oriented differently. If I wanted multiple of these things, if I grab both of them, 2:03:14 shift D. Go 2:03:30 depending on how I would want them to look. Let's save this file. 2:03:51 So, both of those things interacting there. Be able to spread these around wherever you would want in the scene, 2:03:57 but be able to move this around and still have them interact with the geometry here. So, 2:04:04 you know, this is pointing at the camera. This is a child of it to compensate for the rotation depending on how you want it to be there, but allows 2:04:12 for those same kind of things to move around in the scene in terms of the style frames. 2:04:25 What do you guys think in terms of like making the storyboard and the style frames for your project? 2:04:32 Does anybody have anything that's like completely you're completely drawing a blank on how you would do something? 2:04:43 All that's standing between you and complete success is time. 2:05:06 I could do like fireworks. Well, I I would do fireworks this way 2:05:12 now. Like cut out some fireworks and put them on a plane in the scene. 2:05:21 So later that would have to be a particle effect, but I would not wrangle the 2:05:27 particle effect for the style frame, right? So 2:05:33 any image of fireworks on a plane, make sure it's flat to the camera and you 2:05:38 could put a mission on it and you get all your glow and business there as well. 2:05:45 But it's achievable later down the road. 2:05:50 Yeah. 2:05:56 Anything else? How's your day? 2:06:03 It's a rough week for me. 2:06:13 Okay. Well, I'll give you some more time to because that's the only thing you guys need right now. Okay. Awesome. So, 2:06:21 like Tuesday clear on what we want. We want the music with the storyboard 2:06:26 animatic. Very minimal. Just thinking about how it's going to play out in time. And then at least one style frame 2:06:32 where like I got as close to what I want this to look like as possible. If you're going to have two major different looks 2:06:39 or something or different sections or different sets, it might make sense to make more than one style frame depending 2:06:44 on your setup, but allows you to address both things. 2:06:50 And once you have those two things in place, I think, you know, the style frame really helps lock in exactly what 2:06:57 workflow is going to make sense to try and get to that in a production 2:07:02 environment. And then the storyboards are going to help quite a bit in terms of, you know, is this going to what is 2:07:10 what you have planned going to work in time with the rest of what is happening here. 2:07:17 Sound good? Okay, let's call it. I don't think anybody looks like just Angie 2:07:22 there. Alex Alec may have collapsed out of exhaustion. So,",
    "transcript_segment": "240 transcript  he students are like, \"Why does this sound like a coffee shop? What are you talking about?\" I I was one of those kids. 0:22 Why doesn't In my animation class, I would always put on some ambience like very quietly until people 0:31 That was such an annoyance. I love doing that. 0:38 Yeah. Yeah. 0:54 So long. You got to savor it. That's the problem. 1:00 Yeah, you'll deserve a 1:05 metal bar every 20 seconds. But if you get if you if you're concerned about length, you can get the plastic, too. 1:12 PVC pipe. I just want something that I can gaslight people to like 1:19 that's the main goal. The metal pipe. It's too long. You can't ignore it. 1:26 What do you think about that noise. 1:32 And then someone's like, \"It's making that noise.\" And then he just like stayed there for 1:38 like a minute waiting for it. 1:44 They never get to hear it again. That's That's true gas. 1:57 I would do that here if this computer didn't. 2:02 They're lucky. I could bring my own Bluetooth speaker, but then everyone would know I have a speaker. They know 2:07 exactly what classes. You hide it in. 2:15 All right. I think I think this is working now. So, we don't send the music out. 2:21 No, I'm Canon. I'm gonna present my favorite in between. So, 2:27 you did say to not play the music in the presentation. All right. 2:35 It's before Gavin mentioned the thing of muting the thing. Muting the other thing. 2:42 So many windows. Do I need a third monitor? 2:47 I mean, he does have the the audio files returned in probably those 2:54 No, we're just not sending the music out over the live stream so it doesn't get a YouTube strike. 3:12 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think let's see how we go here. 3:17 This project is the most warm light. I really like the the warm colors of the 3:25 light temperature here. Then is the high key lighting shot which actually require 3:32 me to make a whole new scene since uh you know my 180° setup was the cell 3:41 shading style. So it didn't work well for the light this lighting assignment. 3:49 So I made this new one. And then finally is this the loy 3:57 scene which I used to like a small small story that connect this shot with this 4:05 other one here that is also low lightning. 4:13 And then here is the solid shot. 4:24 And then this is the song I choose for my music video, which is the stain by 4:29 Melendi, a Spanish singer. I picked this song because I really like the the 4:34 lyrics and the overall cal feeling of the music. I also think it matches well 4:40 with slower steel scene which will let me focus more on the composition and 4:45 lighting. And that's all for this week. 4:50 Okay, great. Yeah. 4:57 Yeah, these are good. The the high key lowkey lighting here, the 5:03 sorry, highkey. We got um the characters are lit well. I mean there's this dark 5:10 thing in the background that kind of um you know goes against that. But these 5:15 were done 100%. You got the right idea here. 5:21 Was that bat there the whole time or did it just sort of I think we saw that bat before in one of his other shots. I feel 5:28 like she's saying talk to the hand. Talk to my 5:34 Unfortunately, rigged thumb there. 5:40 Yeah, you definitely got the idea for both of them. And the zully shot turned out great. Wow, that looked really good. 5:49 Yeah, even with the um Yeah, works really well even in the different um 5:57 render environment there. Um, 6:06 did he actually give us the music? 6:17 Yeah. Oh, okay. Change the name of it. Okay. And so now if I do this and this, 6:29 we can listen to This 7:02 Okay, good. That's like right. So, again, you won't hear it on the live stream just so that you guys everybody 7:09 knows there because I'm just trying to avoid that's happening. But the we'll hear it here in class. Um, yeah. Okay. 7:17 So, that's an edit. we have like two sections of the song and then yeah the 7:24 two options two obvious options here are either since we're only doing part of it like finding a part where the song you 7:32 can sort of cut or fade it out one or the other versus just having it kind of 7:38 like weirdly edit off. So, um, it sounds like yours there with that break that 7:45 the singer has there. If you cut the music right before it comes back in, 7:50 that'd probably be a good place to end. So, that works. Um, and I mean, how long 7:57 was that? Probably around 20 seconds. Okay. So, I think you're on the right 8:02 track there. That is going to work out just fine. All right. Here's Gavin's. 8:08 Hi there, everybody. This is Gavin. I'm just going to quickly go through these things. So, we got the the three 8:15 favorite renders. This is the tungsten warm lighting. I like how this one turned out. Feels very pleasing to look 8:21 at and I like how everything's arranged. And then I like the two lowkey shots 8:28 that I did for this week. Uh I thought that it was fun using the goos. I used 8:33 the goos in both of these ones for that window pane effect. Um, and it really 8:40 sells that uh idea and it's I like the dramatic lighting of everything. And I 8:45 actually added area lights onto her pupils for that added like bit of emotion to her to make it even more 8:50 dramatic. Um, and then I I just like the warm Yeah. highlights right just when you 8:56 have any just appear right there. Highlights. Yeah, the goos look really good feeling these both have. And I like how 9:02 the goos actually work to they work well here because the the lines of the 9:08 pregnancy test are actually in the light so it leads your eye there naturally and it's just it sells the message of the 9:13 shot which I like. Here's the zali shot. 9:22 All right. And then what? Like the most recent Bachelor. 9:29 The Bachelor. The Bachelor. The Bachelor. Yeah, that's great. I mean, at first 9:34 there wasn't like a lot of stuff around him, but then we see everything warp in. So, that's great. Just so you know, it doesn't it it's 9:40 just uh the media player being weird. It's It doesn't cut like that in real in the actual video. Um yeah, this is this 9:47 worked out well. Uh I added a slight Dutch angle just to add to the madness 9:54 of it all. And I like how how it looks like he's breathing in and out. And then quickly here, 10:00 So, the song I chose is Inner City Pressure by Flight of the Concords. It's like kind of a funny song about city 10:07 life. It's kind of funky. Uh, and I just thought it would be perfect for a music video. The I like the aesthetic style of 10:14 these stills from Bune, who is an animator on YouTube. Uh, I like how she 10:19 kind of portrays cities, like how exaggerated they are and the angles. I 10:25 want to kind of try to recreate that, although maybe not as exaggerated. And I like the these kind of colors. 10:33 I kind of struggled to to figure out what I would use for the color choice, but I like I like the overall idea of 10:40 blue and blues and yellows that are in the movie Drive. So, I chose that as my color reference here. So, yeah, going to 10:47 try to do like the visual aesthetic kind of city life and then also just the 10:54 colors of um how it's portrayed in drive. So, yeah, that's that's it. 10:59 Hi there everybody. This is Gavin. I'm just gonna quickly go through these. 11:10 Cool. This is going to work. Yeah, I could see this either being, you know, these being individual flat things 11:17 or certainly creating, you know, geometry of this nature and then using a 11:24 grease pencil on it so they could move around a little bit would also be a possibility there depending on how much the camera's moving in the shots, right? 11:32 Um either one of those. And then 11:37 yeah, I mean if we're just talking about just the colors, right? Yeah, that could be applied here. But you know this is 11:47 Yeah. Yeah. The colors. But I mean like the um 11:52 applying some of the more like, you know, like optical combinations that are happening between 11:58 the colors because of the fading and everything else in, you know, as like an overlay into this 2D style would be 12:05 maybe an interesting combo of things, right? like in the dedu or however you 12:10 say his name um stuff that we looked at when we were looking at the original 12:16 grease pencil stuff. Um you know he has that grease pencil look but it's always 12:22 has that um pretty severe chromatic aberration filter and bloom on it as 12:29 well which I thought was you know gives it even even more of an ethereal look. Okay. 12:34 I will say though I was thinking 3D. Okay, awesome. 13:21 Cool. 13:36 Yeah. I'm trying to remember which 13:42 is which episode is that in? I don't even know. To be honest, I 13:47 haven't watched the show yet. Oh, really? I just saw I know this. I know a few of their songs 13:53 from the show. I do want to watch the show at some point. Yeah, that's great. Um, yeah. So, I 14:00 mean, it's kind of like the same throughout the entire section, but this one as opposed to Alex, right? This would work better to sort of like just 14:06 fade out a little bit at the end there. And that'll give you a smooth sort of out for this. But you're starting at the 14:12 beginning, so there's a clean beginning. And yeah, I mean I think the challenge here visually is just sort of trying to 14:20 create some, you know, dynamic variations along to, 14:25 you know, something that's kind of chugging along here at the same same pace, but that works. Um, yeah, I can 14:32 see that with the sort of distorted buildings and everything. Um, 14:40 something that technically comes to mind is like maybe like modeling that kind of like blocky chunky building would be 14:47 pretty easy, but then like subdividing it like a whole bunch and then you could 14:53 run some displacement into the uh material to make them lean 14:59 or distort in those sort of like geometric ways. Um, something like that. 15:06 That would be cool. Here is Nat. 15:14 Hi, this is Natalie. Want to quickly show my um three stills. This is one of my favorite ones. I just like how the 15:19 colors looked on here for the warm light. I didn't want to make it too like 15:26 warm. And then this is another one for from the 180 um shot. I just like how 15:35 like kind of like song Brutus is. Um I just like how the lighting looks here. How highlights him as well as for her 15:43 right here. Another one that I have is um the three point one. I just like how 15:52 everything looks. Um then the dolly shot is right here. It's just like a moment 15:57 of realization. It is like the living room I guess. I don't know. Um the music that 16:05 I chose is um the moment of realization like the living room. 16:11 How did you do it? 16:23 The zoom is going the opposite direction of the focal length. No, I zoomed out but then increased the 16:29 focal. I think I just zooming out too far. But but this this guy was in Blender. 16:37 Yeah, it just looks like he's not for some reason. It does flatten out his face a bit by the end of it. Yeah, you 16:43 just picked a range where it's like like the background is definitely distorting, but like his it almost looks like he's 16:48 just like 2D comped in over top because there's like I can barely see any lens distortion in his face. 16:54 Moment of realization living room. Yeah, just a very very slight amount. 17:01 No, I think I mean I think you did it right. You just somehow that was just like this incredible sweet spot of like 17:08 no very little distortion in the middle of the frame. I guess I don't know. Um the music that 17:16 I chose is um by Tyler C. It's called Ring Ring Ring. Um this is a reference that I have for 17:23 this one. I didn't really choose like a full music video. Um 17:28 I'll just show a little bit of this. The audio is off as well on um on both. 17:34 But I just really like the colors here and everything and just how vibrant it is. 17:41 Um, they made this in Blender. It's really fun. 17:47 Believe it was inspired by Persona 4. Mostly persona in general, but yeah. Um, 17:55 this reference is silly. I got this, which is mostly for the dances and the vibe. I don't know how to explain it. 18:01 Um, it's these little puppet dogs dancing. 18:07 Just the vibe here is immaculate. There's a lot of vibe. 18:12 It's mostly where like this whole idea came from. Like they're just the be like dancing in a disc type of thing. Um it's 18:20 kind of like a small story board I have. It's like here to there. Um it's nothing like too big. It's just kind of like a 18:27 general idea that I have for it. Like when the song starts um she's getting a call and then it shows more of like this 18:34 go be spinning and then She says hello again and then foot like a foot uh steps 18:42 into frame and then another hello and start dancing and then show a different 18:47 thing and then after this one is supposed to switch to something else but usually by that um the clip would end 18:53 for the song. But I think that should be everything. Um thank you. Sorry. I hope 18:59 I didn't take up too much time. Yeah, that I mean hold Oh, let's hear 19:06 the song. 19:37 This is going to happen. 19:53 Okay, I feel like the media player is just punking me at this point. What is going on here? 20:07 Turn it up. You want to play on there's not intentionally like 10 20:13 seconds of quiet at the beginning. What? Okay. Perhaps there's 20:19 unintentionally 15 seconds of quiet. You know what it did? It got the part where I didn't edit it out, but I didn't 20:49 Okay. And so we we didn't miss anything there. Like it just there's a part where you hear the phone 20:54 ringing. He says hello at least three times. Uhhuh. But that's what got cut out for some reason. I didn't put a fade in or 21:00 anything in Audacity. I don't know why they didn't. Okay. It hasn't done that to me before. 21:06 Okay. Well, go just go back and look at the Audacity edit again. Yeah. And then a fade out the end. Yeah. This song's gonna work. It'll be great. Um, yeah. I 21:13 don't know. The the I think I get what you're saying here, but the um 21:20 I mean, as I was looking at the things, the idea of like hands reaching in and like manipulating 21:28 the these guys also struck me as funny like they are 21:33 here. Oh, so this is two two the same song. This is Yeah, it's two the same song. 21:44 Does this person who who's making the monkeys dance to Tyler the Crater? They have like 45 million followers or 21:50 something on Tik Tok. 22:03 And so are you thinking that there would be look like people or Yeah, there'll be people here. There'll be people. Okay. 22:13 You could just 22:20 Yeah, I was I mean there's no low maintenance way to do 22:26 to do that. That wouldn't seem weird. 22:38 Yeah, besides having like a giant hand and then like parenting the IK controls for the fingers to the to the dancing 22:46 thing, but I mean that still seems like it'd be 22:51 a lot of of trial and error there. 22:58 The um Cool. All right. So far so good. Yeah, 23:04 that's crazy with the Zi shot that you got it with that little distortion on the face like that whatever either like 23:10 maybe the distance to the camera or something like but yeah, it looks great. 23:31 I'm gonna go with like a dictatorship kind of vibe. Here's pictures from uh My Romance. Uh here is in the middle of the 23:39 concert, they do a little execution. There's little people with bags over their heads. These little cardboard 23:44 cutouts come up. Uh there's a little countdown and then and they all die. Uh 23:51 so, uh I want those like cardboard I'm going to have like my own version of carb cutters come out from like the 23:57 ground and encircle someone. Uh, another picture to kind of like the little marly 24:03 look. Um, and then this is from the Dear Dictator music video, 24:10 uh, which I'll be making, uh, the music video for. Uh, so a lot of red, a lot of 24:16 black. Uh, and then there's that execution vibe that I'm going for. Uh, 24:22 my fa three favorite renders. Uh, the tungsten warm light. I really like how it turned out. uh the low key 24:31 um just like how sinister that is. And then I put the little 24:37 like blinds kind of noir detective but like it's a mannequin. Uh and then for my Z shot uh I named him Kyle. 24:49 And I I did uh change the lighting a little bit um as it zooms out. So that is my 24:59 assignment. Hello. This is my assignment for the week. Yeah. Awesome. And so is is this like 25:05 their own glyph thing or they made their own alphabet language. 25:13 Oh, okay. For this tour, there's actually good on 25:18 the person that made the stuff about it. 25:38 Did you include the song or No, I forgot. I clipped it on YouTube, but 25:44 then I forgot to I had it like copied onto the clipboard and I just forgot to 25:49 Okay, I can tell you the song and 25:54 I'll look it up later. What What's the name of the tune? Uh, Dear Dictator by Saint Motel. 25:59 Saint Motel. Yes. Okay. No, the 26:08 Is that right? The 26:43 Yeah. In in the morning class, Zoe's name is Zoe Kyle. And then I'm looking at your stuff and it says Z Kyle and I'm 26:52 like I named him Kyle. I was just sort of like wait what is 26:57 going on here? 27:08 I clearly know nothing about anything. Did you take this footage from the were you at the show? 27:14 Um, so that one uh was from a YouTube video. The other one is from a YouTube 27:20 video, but the one at the stage that was photo from I was there in Chicago. 27:26 Cool. Yeah. Yeah, I mean the idea of having, you know, like three 3D stuff and then like 2D cardboard cutout stuff, 27:33 you know, in the same thing, especially because I mean you could certainly, you know, given our it works stylistically, 27:39 but then you could also probably build out like the stylized environments like that if things were just flat cutouts, 27:46 you know, and then the main thing is a 3D thing. I was thinking of having it be like more 27:52 like more than just like three tones, but like more sty like that. 27:59 Because like the dictator vibes like white, black, the gray, the marble, and 28:04 then red. I could like do a little bit extra on top of that, but like limit the color 28:11 palette. Yeah. I mean, you can have as many nodes in the ramp as you want. Yeah. So, yeah. 28:22 Super. That's going to work. 28:56 Hello. Hello. Here are my renders for this week. Um, in general, I prefer the lowkey lighting because I like higher 29:03 contrast images in general. I like the vibe, you know? So, it was a little harder to do the highkey lighting in a 29:09 way I found appealing, but I tried. And here's my Zulli shot. Uh, it is what it 29:15 is. My bad. And for my music video, I chose this song for a number of reasons 29:21 such as um it sounds good. I like listening to it. I enjoy hearing it, 29:26 etc., etc. And for my references, I have a bunch of images from the good, the bad, the ugly 29:34 and convenient Google search for the color palettes and the settings. 29:41 Um, I can't explain the vision, but I have one. Okay, rest assured I have it under control 29:47 and that's all really. Hello. Hello. Cool. 29:53 These looked really great coming across Discord. Yeah, this scene definitely obviously way better. Um, with, you 30:01 know, all of our really outlined 30:06 characters. I feel like everybody gets this now like using the light to define 30:13 the silhouette of the character even in dark scenes, right? Especially in dark 30:18 scenes because and especially in animation stuff because they just drop off into just monotone, you know, 30:24 nothingness. Yeah. And this was a tall order to make this kind of lighting work for this scene. Um there but then Yeah. 30:32 and the like cool nature of the um silhouette. Yeah, like these 30:38 characters have really distinct silhouettes between this mask face thing and like the big shoulder pads and 30:44 everything. So, it all works really well. Looks really good. Yeah. So, the thing here, you know, doing a 30:53 I mean, I can imagine somebody using a zali shot in the music video. um 31:01 you know trying to make it look a little bit more you know legit. Definitely not having it ease in and ease out. Um it 31:09 seems like you know unless you're doing something where it was going to ease like a lot at the end like we were going 31:14 to really like ease into this final section. If it's if 31:20 it's a much quicker thing like it most likely is in a music video, you know, something much much closer to linear. 31:26 Um, you know, like pulling out make especially this kind of thing like think about what would happen in real life to 31:33 try and ease in and ease out of this, right? You would need to be easing the movement of the camera on the track or 31:40 the dolly or whatever and then also the pulling of of the lens at the same time. 31:47 So it's like, you know, really not in in the cards there. 31:54 But that one works, especially here, you know, bending everything around what's happening to that character 32:01 here. Let me put on the song while we look at this. 32:57 Cool. Who is that? 33:03 Rainbow Kitten Surprise. Rainbow Kitten Surprise. 33:09 I'll look that up. Yeah, that's really great. That's not the name I would have thought 33:15 made that music. 33:21 And so I mean is it outside or is it inside? Okay. 33:31 Cool. Yeah, this is a moody bar. 33:45 Have you guys been to that crazy bar in Arcadia like that has the fake train? 33:52 You're not even 21. So 33:59 yeah, 35th 45th Street. 34:04 What is the name of it? 34:20 Uh, this is it, right? 34:26 Is that part of it? Yeah. 34:32 Uh, Jen was there. I haven't been there. Like there's like three or four of these 34:39 like high high concept um establishments 34:46 all like they're on the same property. Um and they all have like this 34:55 pretty crazy amount of I mean there's a bunch of mixology happening if that if you're into that. But then um yeah, each 35:02 of the bars which you need reservations for all have their own like themes and 35:07 like one of them is a train car here and um the train there's no it's a train car 35:14 but there's no like train um and like these are all 35:19 screens that they've all synchronized to make it seem like it's you know moving and then there's you know like moving 35:25 through some strange areas but Yeah, I've heard good things. I mean, there's 35:32 not many other super high concept drinking establishments in town, but 35:39 Yes. 35:48 Did you watch this recently? 35:54 Yeah. Do you fit it in between Fast and 35:59 Furious four and five? 36:09 Too fast. Yeah, there's a joke there somewhere. 36:22 Well, his his son is in the movies. Um 36:28 Scott 36:35 Yeah, Scott Eastwood is in um I don't know, he shows up in like six or 36:41 seven or something like that. 36:46 Yeah, 67. 36:56 See, I I I don't totally I don't understand that at all. Like like when am I supposed to say that? Just whenever 37:02 whenever those two numbers come up. Don't say it. Just never never say it. Never say it. 37:07 No. It won't make me look cooler as like an old guy like saying cool stuff. Well, it's just it's not even cool. 37:15 I don't understand it either. My co-workers at work keep doing it to me though and I don't get it. 37:31 I I explained e how how did you explain that exactly? 37:38 Mainly by pulling up the image. But they were like but why like E? 37:45 Then someone else that knew what E was like E. Here's 37:51 Gage. My name is Gage and here is my lighting presentation. 37:56 Here I have one of my highkey shots that I like. Oh 38:02 yeah. So Angie says platform 18. I think the whole thing is called Century Grand. 38:07 Like the whole multiple high concept experiences 38:16 and Yeah. Okay. So, this is great like using 38:22 this here, right? Really like defining the foreground character there creates a lot of dynamic, you know, 38:28 contrast in the image. I also did. 38:34 Yeah. So maybe the the thing here like maybe there's just something giving us a 38:39 little bit of sense of like the outline of this character on this side perhaps 38:45 because again we're just dropping off into nothing over there. If we go back to this hike shot I fixed the 180 degree 38:53 camera rule here. Cool. All right. I'm glad you understood what we're trying to say there. And I 38:58 did really also like the threepoint day shot as well with the three-point 39:05 lighting in it. Yeah, that looks really good. The only I mean like really really hard shadow 39:13 there, right? Even if you want to have quoteunquote hard shadows like getting some again CG is too perfect, right? 39:20 Like um you would never be able to make that in real life. And so if you're going for this kind of rendering style 39:26 where it does look quote unquote more realistic, you just moving over that 39:31 slider a little bit to give the shadow a little bit of softness. Have my zali 39:36 shot. That's right. You had it in the last one. 39:47 See, that's what what's going on with the Miximo mascara there. She has like really 39:56 And this is the song that I'm using for reference uh for my music video. And here I have 40:05 a screenshot from John Wick in the club scene and a club scene from Blade as 40:12 well. I wanted to include some sort of like Fang character in my 40:19 um I like going to really violent clubs scene for the music video, but I haven't 40:26 gotten to that kind of complicated uh characters yet. 40:31 But I mostly just like their two color schemes that are kind of similar, 40:37 especially that kind of pinkish violet. 40:47 I have 41:06 my video for it here. 41:27 Yeah. Awesome. Right. So I mean I if yeah obviously doing a lot of work here 41:33 to figure out how can I get this kind of look that I want here right? So this, 41:40 you know, the falling in category probably not, you know, like what I would say is a style 41:46 frame in that like this is not presumably it's not a club of robots. 41:51 Um, but more of what I would put under under the category of lookdev, right? 41:57 Just really quickly, you know, I've got this concept, you know, how what would it how difficult is it going to be to 42:03 try and make that happen given this environment? Cool. Okay. And let's um 42:10 what was the other thing I wanted to say about this? Yeah, I mean it gives us a really good 42:16 sense of the the vibe here, which is great. And then 42:23 here is Gauges. 42:39 No, that's just this part again. Maybe he didn't. 42:54 Yeah, I don't think he included the actual thing. 43:16 I have a screenshot. Professional griefers. 44:09 Shortcuts all over the place. 44:44 Yeah. All right. That's part of it. And he didn't have the edit up there, but I 44:51 think that's the gist of what he was saying. Let's see what else. 45:02 Alex. Alex. There we go. 45:40 Okay. And then Angie has a tune. 46:26 Cool. 46:35 I mean, that's a good section of this. These got to be some weird sections going over the stream here, just 46:40 watching me in silence listen to music. But, um, yeah. I mean, the only thing that strikes me there is like that's 46:46 pretty long. Um, you know, pushing that 40 50 second range. Maybe once it comes 46:54 into some of those sections, maybe there's a couple bars that could be cut out or something depending on what you're doing there. But that that will 47:02 work for sure. And you had a zi shot, too. 47:25 Close. Okay, you're on the right track there. So, you It looks like the camera's moving. 47:35 but not quite zooming as much. And so the thing that's tricky here is 47:42 trying to keep the pig the same size in the frame as the movement is offset by 47:49 the Z. That's the main main issue there. 47:55 Um, so the movement is right on, but you just got to try and compensate with the 48:01 zoom that's happening. Okay. Uh, do we miss anybody? 48:08 We looked at Alex stuff, right? Yes. Yeah. Uh, 48:14 wait, we didn't look at Jack's, right? No. Okay. Well, say something. 48:29 Did you for 48:51 And did you end up rendering that in EV or cycles? EV. Okay. And did the particles increase 48:57 your render time noticeably? I don't think so. I mean, I didn't do that many. It was maybe like 49:04 10,000 on each plane. There's like three planes there. 30,000 maybe. 49:09 Yeah. So, the particles are rendered in a different way. They're sort of drawn 49:15 over there in the GPU. So, it's, you know, more efficient. 49:37 Is that chest air on the model? Yeah. 50:07 I had a lot of fun doing this. My ABC200 character for my video game class and yeah, it was really cool. I added some 50:13 sound and stuff too. Um added some film grain, made it the um 4x3 resolution and 50:19 um I thought this was really cool and uh bit of a teaser of what my game could look like maybe. But um um yeah, and 50:24 then for the uh song, so for the song, I want to do an EDM song uh by Drew, my 50:30 favorite artist. It's called Grinder Hustle. This song is actually a song that like kind of made me like a fan of 50:36 them. Um so I mean that's it's a special song in that sense. Yeah, there's a 50:41 really cool part at the end um that I think has like a very chaotic but also calm atmosphere. Like it starts 50:47 off calm and goes very chaotic at the end. So, I thought I got like a really nice um contrast there with like very 50:52 serene shots and having like go crazy like the same scene go crazy. This group, it's two people. It's a music 50:59 artist and a 3D designer 3D model, but a 3D designer made this scene for it. So, 51:04 I mean that is inspiration, but um this is the actual artist itself. Um and I wanted to have it take place in a 51:11 school. Um but I want Is this the same people responsible for the image you use as your desktop? 51:18 like detailed like a very detailed like classroom setting. Obviously that all 51:24 depends on if I can find the right like Blender kit assets and stuff and maybe make my own assets and stuff. Yeah. So these are my inspirations. Um you know 51:30 just this kind of look um which is kind of the look they they've already been doing. So um I thought that'd be cool. 51:37 Uh I don't know how difficult it'll be to kind of make um this type of like really nice looking uh lighting and 51:43 stuff, but I would definitely like to try to do that. Yeah. So, I mean, uh, I suppose this is kind of what I imagined 51:49 the environment would look like during like the chaotic part of the song. So, I was going to like have all the chairs 51:54 and stuff be calm, and then when it goes crazy, everything like flies up into the air and it's just like in all in slow-mo 51:59 and stuff and we'll see. But that that's the plan. That's everything for this week. Uh, thank you and goodbye. 52:05 So, when you pick something that's already in kind of like music video form like this, 52:10 there's no music video, just that image. Just that image, that's all. These are just other like that's other artwork for other songs. 52:16 Yeah. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. I mean, just um find some way to put your own stamp 52:22 on it besides you know just I mean obviously there's a lot to be learned from trying to hit the mark of making it 52:28 look this good looks great, right? Um but you know what what other what else 52:34 can you contribute creatively there? I mean the stuff where you know there's some sort of the 2D things comped in or 52:43 not comp. I mean just depends like the these kind of things with the grid of 52:49 stuff. Um but yeah I mean just trying to think how you know like what what can 52:56 you do to sort of give it your own your own twist there while trying to to learn something from that. 53:02 What what was the name of the group? Drew. Drew 53:08 D. Yeah, I think I got it. I'm just waiting for the 53:27 whole grind [ __ ] 54:04 Oh, okay. I see it. 55:00 ABC240. Cool. That's great. 55:09 None of your none of your other classrooms have subwoofers. 55:14 Uh, yeah, that'll be awesome. You say drulu. 55:20 Yeah, it's Dutch. Oh, okay. It's like Yeah. There's probably some other like mouth 55:25 consonant things in there. I can't even do right. No, I think it's pronounced just like 55:31 Dulu. Just Dulu. Okay. 55:47 And then uh Angie says uh Jack's animated sailor character actually looks like Jack. That's because Jack took a 55:53 picture of his own face and put it on put it on the uh animated character that he just sort of downsampled it. Looking 56:00 at it that time there is a lot of like color noise in the down sampling like 56:05 you might depending on I mean it might be worth going back and I mean you just saved it at a lower 56:11 resolution, right? Like is that how you down sampled it? I did that but I also like crushed on the amount of colors. 56:17 You did smoosh it. Okay. All right. And I can change that too. Like it's Yeah. I nothing was destructive. So 56:23 cool. Then over here I found that presentation 56:32 that I wanted to show everybody or at least parts of it and I think it's super useful. 57:07 Okay. So, I'll put this link in there. Turns out all of the past presentations 57:12 have been archived on this one site. Um, so, uh, a couple things to write down 57:19 when you're looking for things in terms of other content. um like 57:26 databases full of amazing talks. The yearly computer graphics conference is 57:32 called just want to get it right sigraph I've been I don't know 57:37 twice three times um and so 57:43 silicon something graphics it's a really obtuse acronym it's barely an acronym anyway 57:50 sigraph is what everybody says they have their own 57:55 uh YouTube channel and online repository there's both like a publicly facing one 58:01 um uh and it's like the worldwide organization the big cigar conference 58:10 is mostly goes back and forth between Vancouver and Los Angeles in opposite 58:16 years but then every not every but like a lot of other continents have their own 58:22 uh respective cigraph conference there's like sigraph Asia sigraph Europe um and so there's a lot of great talks there. 58:29 Um not only the talks that are associated with the and presented by the conference itself, but all these things 58:36 work that there's you know the accepted conference presenters. These presentations are usually happening in 58:42 some sort of you know uh convention center and or hotel presentation room of 58:49 some kind. And then in addition to that, most of these conferences have like a show floor where companies and uh 58:58 software designers and production companies have booths of varying degrees of complexity. And then a lot of them 59:04 those boo like calling it a booth is like it's like a whole temporary popup 59:11 store, huge uh with their own stages and presentation areas. And so this was part 59:17 of the Cinema 4D presentation at these um at this series of conferences. The 59:23 other one is NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters 59:29 Broadcasters. Um that happens every year. I believe 59:34 it's still always in Vegas. Um and all of the companies also have a 59:42 whole bunch of presentations there at all times. they also have their own online repository of stuff. Um, a lot of 59:49 these things the going to the conference as like a 59:56 regular citizen is under most circumstances prohibitively 1:00:01 expensive. Um but almost all these associations have uh student 1:00:07 uh you can belong as a student and when you do that um some of them I'm pretty 1:00:14 sure this is the case with SIGRAP if you volunteer at the event you get free entry into the event which is you know 1:00:21 if you just buy a pass as a regular person uh it's like $2500 or I mean probably 1:00:29 more now that's a lot. Um, and 1:00:35 what was the other one I was thinking of? 1:00:41 The other great source is um the GDC, the gamedev uh conference which 1:00:50 every year is in San Francisco. uh they have both an amazing amount of talks 1:00:58 archived on YouTube and then on their own site as well and there's all of all 1:01:05 of these have like you know publicly available ones and then you know if you're a member there's an additional 1:01:10 area where there's all of the stuff from the conferences which is a lot. Um, so 1:01:17 these are all stuff that does not get floated to the 1:01:23 top by the YouTube algorithm much at all. But in terms of like the qual like 1:01:30 if you're presenting in one of these conferences you have applied a bunch of people have applied and a panel of 1:01:37 industry experts have selected this select people to present and so the 1:01:44 quality of information here even if it's not how to do this in blender just sort 1:01:50 of the general artistic and technical knowledge is very high for all of these 1:01:56 Right. Um so great especially SIGRAPH and GDC have focused a lot more recently 1:02:03 on like uh student portfolio reviews um a lot of things like that where a lot of 1:02:10 really useful information about the current state of the industries and what people are doing and um 1:02:19 yeah in addition to all of the artistic and technical stuff. Those are the three 1:02:25 main ones that come to mind. Um, more designminded stuff is um, FITC. 1:02:36 I have no idea what that acronym stands for. That's more of a design uh, conference, but I'll show you the one 1:02:42 title sequence from that. That was really great. So yeah, some of these more high-profile conferences are such 1:02:49 big productions that they hire like a marquee artist or team of artists to 1:02:55 make a title sequence, which is essentially a music video for just the conference, right? Like like you would 1:03:02 have for a TV show or a movie or a game, but just for the conference. Um, and so 1:03:07 one of the ones we can look at later has that. Uh, great. And so what this is is this, you know, this is an older one uh 1:03:14 from what I was talking about before uh from uh Pacific Rim the you know 1:03:19 designing the titles for um Pacific Rim here. And so uh this gentleman here is a 1:03:27 uh this is Ryan Summers who I was speaking about before. He has his own um 1:03:34 uh production company or design studio. Now 1:03:40 more or is it swerve? 1:03:47 It's like swerve or bend or 1:03:52 lift. Split like a one word. Yeah. Spilt. That's why 1:04:00 I couldn't remember it. It's not even like a word. Um 1:04:05 uh they do a bunch of like really really high quality motion graphics and 1:04:10 animation stuff. Um and yeah, here we can play some parts of this. Uh the 1:04:18 design process here is interesting. Um I was walking there, you know, as I hit render and I'm looking at my phone. I'm 1:04:25 asking, you know, does anybody think the movie is going to be good? A buddy of mine worked on he's like, \"Yeah, check it out. Tell me what you think of the titles.\" Saw them. They're beautiful. 1:04:31 I'm walking back to if to see my renders when I come back. I'm like, man, how many people worked on it? It was really awesome. And like it was a really tiny 1:04:37 team. It was about 10 designers and 15 animators. And I literally had to stop and like hold myself up against the wall 1:04:43 because they had 10 times the amount of people we had to try to get their opening and closing titles done. And uh 1:04:48 we had a lot less time. I think it was about four weeks to do the whole thing. So this is actually the entire Yeah. So 1:04:55 these three guys, maybe some other people right at the time. Everyone here works at Imaginary Forces with the 1:05:01 design studio. Um, and they're pitching Giomod Toro on the original Pacific Rim, 1:05:07 the first Pacific Rim titles tool lights. There's a couple bounce 1:05:12 cards, which is basically a fancy word for a plane with a circle gradient on it that you can actually just place to just 1:05:17 highlight some reflections. Um, but that was the only way we could go and just hack stuff down to actually be able to get something out really fast. And it's 1:05:24 kind of the underwhelming or underlined theme of this whole thing is how much can you get with as little as possible 1:05:29 to be able to knock this stuff out. So, okay. So, this is actually from the presentation deck that we sent to Gummo 1:05:36 for our first round of uh just review. So, we took uh those renders and we 1:05:41 created the first concept which we call the graphic novel. And the idea was really to take these renders and to put 1:05:46 them into some really basic environments, but we wanted to create some photographic uh feelings and look 1:05:52 by using depth of field, by using some light glows. And uh we just took these models and put cameras in interesting 1:05:58 places. Like this is actually a shoulder blade from one of the Jagers. And we were able to just create these really 1:06:03 interesting looking uh compositions. Uh again, the lighting is just that one big soft box. to put some other soft boxes 1:06:09 on the side and we just thought we'd create these very, you know, explosive comic book moments and um as we're going 1:06:17 through here. So that's right. So style frames, right? 1:06:22 This is part of in in this case when they're pitching him, you'll see this one and a couple other they did a couple 1:06:29 style frame decks were like what about this style or what about this style or what about this style? And so important 1:06:34 not only to like nail down what everybody wants to see, but you know they're doing it in an environment 1:06:41 that's close enough to the production environment where this will help in terms of like actually setting up the 1:06:48 actual output later on. Uh a concept that we initially just imagined and we thought of and we 1:06:53 presented to GMO and he really loved these. He really thought that this was a completely different take of how to see 1:06:58 those designs. He says, \"Oh, the sexy robots.\" Yeah. And he he just kept wanting to call him 1:07:04 the sexy robots. G's pretty awesome because like we came with our nice like designer names for like graphic novel or I forget Neotokyo. 1:07:11 And like Gimmel's a big dude, a big like amazing guy. And he's like sexy robots. And we kept on looking through and we're 1:07:16 like, \"Oh, we're going to show these other ones that you'll see some of them.\" But he was always like, \"Uh, just go back to sexy robots. I want to see sexy robots again.\" It was just like, so 1:07:23 for the rest of the project, all of our cool names just turned to make the robots as sexy as possible. And again, 1:07:28 we understood that we the audience would have been seeing an entire, you know, two-hour film full of ILM rendered 1:07:35 textured, you know, rigged robots. So that we didn't want to do that. We want to do something that's completely different. We want to do something 1:07:41 that's very sleek and minimal and stylized. Uh so this was the solution that we came up with. Uh so here are 1:07:47 some of the other directions that we pitched for the main tiles. We also did a version just using a simple mograph 1:07:52 rig and a shader to create this sort of topological map. And this map basically 1:07:58 would serve as a device for us to just go through different title cards. Uh this is actually a screen grab from that 1:08:04 rig uh that's set up in cinema. And uh we thought at some moment it would be really cool if the rift started 1:08:10 opening to you know signify the Mariana Trench. Did I say that right? Mariana. I always call it Marinara Trench. 1:08:16 Marin. Yeah. I always say that too. which GMO kind of likes but it's I think it's Marianas trench 1:08:22 I don't know I actually got it right this time Mariana I always get it wrong so we just you know thought of this idea 1:08:28 there wasn't a lot of you know development in terms of the story but we just presented to him and he actually 1:08:34 really loved this concept too and this eventually evolved into what is now the main title uh reveal for the film 1:08:40 yeah how many people have seen Pacific Rim I hope a few people have seen it yeah so you know that moment where Pacific Rim comes in and there's a huge 1:08:46 sound queue and everybody kind of cheers in the movie. That wasn't in the movie at all. It wasn't even supposed to be there and it just actually kind of came out of 1:08:52 this one where he hesitated for a second. He's like, \"That would be cool too, but we can't do two main on ends. Can we do something with this?\" 1:08:59 Yeah. And this was all done with physical render very quick. Uh in addition to the 3D concepts, we 1:09:05 also uh took the models and did some really quick sketch and tune renders. And we also 1:09:11 So sketch and tune was the Cinema 4D version of like a grease pencil kind of thing. added some lighting to make some 1:09:18 frames out of those models which look kind of like this. And the idea behind 1:09:23 these frames were that we wanted to take uh the geometry and some of the schematic drawings that were provided 1:09:29 for us and to create this very almost like draftsmanlike look at the building of the Jagers. Yeah, there's a there's a 1:09:36 funny story about these two that I hopefully uh Chip's not watching, our owner, but uh the brief was so tight and 1:09:41 was so short that like the original idea was just put type over some of the art that they already gave us. Like if you 1:09:47 know Gimmel Del Toro, the guy loves concept art. He loves building stuff. He makes more art than you'll ever see in the movie. So the original brief was 1:09:52 like just put some cool design type over some cool images. Let's get in, let's get out, let's go home. And then when we 1:09:58 drove in um one of them, right? So if you're making style frames for a motion picture, then it's concept 1:10:03 art, right? Same idea like how close can we get to what the final thing is on 1:10:09 screen without going through the entire going through ideally some sort of like much shorter process and much more 1:10:15 flexible process to work out the details of what we want to see and 1:10:21 what we don't want to see right because just like with you know especially with any movie with a lot of VFX or an 1:10:27 animated film you know if you change something about the final look you may have to change a whole bunch of the 1:10:34 workflow in order to get to that final look in some sort of like reasonable fashion. Our owners actually I didn't think actually had seen this at the time and 1:10:40 actually called us halfway in when you see the whole presentation book and pulled us off the road and said like are you guys sure you want to try to submit 1:10:47 this? Do you think you can actually get any of these done in the amount of time we have? Cuz that's totally beyond what we thought the scope of this project was 1:10:53 going to be. But the strength of everything that you're seeing right now, I don't know how many people do this, but almost all these boards that Miguel 1:10:58 designed originated in cinema. He's creating actual production art for the style frames that if any of these got 1:11:04 green lit, you could literally go and just start working that day that million different sources. It's actually stuff 1:11:09 that at least for some of these we could start the next day right away running. So we were really confident that what we knew with cinema we were designing to a 1:11:17 brief in terms of amount of time. That's one of the things that we really leveraged being able to use cinema just building frames in the actual program. 1:11:23 Oh, and in case it wasn't mentioned, the scope of the project was that we had to do a two and a half minute main on title 1:11:29 sequence in stereoscopic 3D at 2K resolution. We would have one and a half 1:11:36 months. Yeah. And I get one animator. And when I asked my producer, what does that mean? I get 1:11:41 one animator. It means I get to animate and I get an animator. No, you are that one animator. Mhm. So, 1:11:47 the fact that GMO liked that second concept and that evolved into a main title sequence gave us a little bit more 1:11:53 of a budget. You get one animator, you so that we could bring on a couple more team members and uh 1:12:00 yeah, you you'll see some of the other designs like this one. This was my absolute favorite. And for whatever reason, I thought I knew GMO really 1:12:05 well. I'm like 97% he's going with this one. There's no way he's not doing anything else. But we were scared to death because this one wasn't done in 1:12:11 cinema. This is all a really beautiful illustrator named uh Mitran that made this. They're stunning. These could be 1:12:16 like Mondo alternate posters for the movie. Um but we're like we're going to have to make every single one of these 1:12:22 things. So it actually turned out that I was dead wrong. Yeah, we were we were sort of covering our basis with this sequence because the 1:12:28 main thrust of the first meeting was we had to walk out of that meeting with a green light as to go into One Direction. 1:12:33 And we knew that because Pacific Rim was so manga inspired and influenced, we had 1:12:39 to at least do one homage to manga uh just to cover our bases. But this was actually the one I was the most scared 1:12:44 of that they picked because yeah, how would you animate this? You basically have to get a cell animator to 1:12:50 just come in and knock it out. But uh yeah, the they were really beautiful frames and um so GMO didn't like him because he said 1:12:56 kids don't like that stuff. Kids like sexy robots. So apparently in GMO's world, sexy robots are what? like 1:13:02 8-year-olds go for uh this is another concept. Basically, we thought, well, what if there was some 1:13:07 like war propaganda that was being put out during this time in Japan and uh this is essentially what we thought it 1:13:13 would look like. And again, a lot of that stuff's actually cinema assets just treated differently. Um 1:13:19 don't show this one. I didn't think we were showing this one. Oh, this one I I don't do boards very often, but this is my board. 1:13:24 Yeah, this is embarrassing. So, we did uh some trap code form stuff. Yeah. So, um, we I don't know if you've 1:13:31 ever seen the person. I mean, this actually looks a lot like the original Avengers title sequence here. 1:13:36 Of interest TV show. We had just rolled off of that in a similar type of like really quick turnaround. And uh, we had 1:13:41 built up a lot of techniques to really quickly create depth and atmosphere and kind of fog. And uh, I was just like, 1:13:47 I'm just going to keep building on what I did. Give me some stuff from the trailer. Like these are these are actually screenshots from the trailer. So, we did it. We started building up 1:13:53 volumes. I started trying to move a camera through to see it. was totally fine until Miguel reminded me like we still have to do this in stereo. How are 1:14:00 you going to do 80 million little dots of light in stereo? So I was actually so 3D, right? Um so when you render I 1:14:09 mean stereo referring to two Y's in this case and so um 1:14:15 you needs to be two renders, one for each eye. The way that the separate 1:14:21 images get to each eye varies a little bit depending on how it is you're viewing the thing, but you still need to 1:14:27 render those separately. Right? So the uh some for simple situations you can 1:14:35 set uh an output on the render settings to get stereo output. But then for more 1:14:44 uh intricate sort of things in order to have more control over what the apparent depth is then you need to sort of have 1:14:51 some sort of rig that manages two cameras in the 3D environment. Um that 1:14:57 you know the distance between the two cameras can help change the 1:15:03 uh appearance of depth in the stereo image. But this, you know, so this 1:15:09 whatever it said it was 2013, this is right, I would say on the upswing of 1:15:15 when people were really excited about 3D television. Um, so like all of the big 1:15:22 the other big conference, not art related, is the consumer electronic show that happens in January in Las Vegas 1:15:29 every year, and that's all the new consumer stuff. But like for that five-year period, it was all 1:15:37 there were no better screens being made. And so trying to make everything 3D was 1:15:43 the way they were going to sell everyone new televisions. But you know, like now not as much. I mean, did does anybody 1:15:49 opt into that when they go to the movies to try and see the stereo version at this point? 1:15:55 Yeah. You still release movies in 3D sometimes? Yeah. Like a handful of things come out in 3D. I mean, like not 1:16:02 as much, right? So, like this total fad uh situation. I've seen a handful of TVs 1:16:10 that do it without glasses or stuff, but 1:16:15 it's pretty limited and you have there's a very small sweet spot. Meaning, like it looks pretty good if you stand like 1:16:21 right there. Uh but then if you What's that? 3DS. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you move offaxis at 1:16:29 all, it's not not that great of an experience. But the most convincing 1:16:34 version of it that still only works for one person is having a tracker 1:16:40 and then rendering the stuff in real time. So it like figures out where your head is and then if you move and your 1:16:46 head the images the image adjusts, but that you know that like that's a bunch 1:16:51 of live compute that's happening. She really scared to even show it. So thankfully GM was like that's too girly 1:16:56 or too wispy or too it's not robots enough. So we dodged a bullet with that one. Cool. Uh okay. So then as part of the 1:17:05 presentation we just showed a lot of the graphic language that we thought could house the type and um Oh wait, you got to go back. You got to 1:17:11 go back. Are there any designers in in the audience at all? Okay. Okay. So, if you ever design for a movie for a director who's like a big big guy who's 1:17:17 going to actually be involved with the art direction, a really good tip if you like a specific design, you want him to see it before anybody else, just put his 1:17:23 name on it. Yeah. Cuz he went for I don't know if he went with that one, but I know he saw that one and I know that was one of his 1:17:30 favorites. So, it's kind of like the opposite of the purple cow theory. Like, give him his name on it. He'll at least notice it. 1:17:35 What was funny was that we presented this app. I can grab those cameras, move them around. But the real power to this, and 1:17:41 I don't know why it's set up this way in Maxon, uh, with Cinema, but if you actually start pulling these down, it took me a long time to find this. You 1:17:48 can start actually fine-tuning all this stuff. And you can go in. So like right now, footsteps are probably Let's just 1:17:55 turn off footsteps. And then this is just some of the rotation confidence check 1:18:00 camera motion rig. So basically, you know how your how your eyes work. Say if you have your finger in front of your face and you look at 1:18:07 you look at your finger with your left eye and switch to your right eye, you notice that your eyes cross. So it's a 1:18:13 good rule of thumb. When something is coming out of the screen into the audience space, your eyes are crossed. So if you're looking at your stereo 1:18:19 image and you close your left eye and that stereo image is on the right hand side and you open your right eye. So 1:18:24 here's a little bit of what the final thing 1:18:37 an extreme trying to the characters with the light, right? 1:18:44 Like none of these silhouettes would look like anything without these like really 1:18:55 and there's another section in here where they talk at length about um you know there's like one maybe two actually 1:19:02 3D lights in most of these scenes and then the rest of it is HDRs and so a lot 1:19:07 of these HDRs would look like nothing. They' just be black with like some random color and white spots in them and 1:19:14 you know just putting trying out different HDRs with that robot shape and spinning them around until it just 1:19:20 interacted with the thing, right? Because it's not HDR like a photographic one where the sun is here and if you 1:19:27 start spinning it around and you see in the background it's going to look weird. Just a bunch of highlights and colors 1:19:32 and stuff and so you can spin it around and still have it look abstract and interesting. So anyways, this whole I'll 1:19:38 you know post a link to this. This is the entire in 1:19:45 maybe not entire but like a really sizable archive of 1:19:50 um Cinema 4D um presentations at Sigraph 1:19:55 and NAB over I don't know a long at least 1:20:02 over a decade at this point. Um yeah, so a really great talk and 1:20:08 everybody's very candid there about the um progression of that project. 1:20:17 Um 1:20:23 here's another take on style framing. This is kind of a pres a progression from 1:20:29 um style frames to uh again working in a format to produce 1:20:34 the style frames that's going to be useful later on. Right? So again, the thing with the style frame is like you 1:20:40 want it to get as close as you can and just need to make calls about like where does it make time make sense to invest 1:20:47 time in maybe making an asset or two and where does it make sense to like skip 1:20:52 stuff in order to just try and get it on there, right? Um, 1:20:58 this is a much more high stakes decision when you're 1:21:03 pitching stuff in terms of like how much, you know, time and effort am I and 1:21:09 possibly my employees putting into this thing because I mean a lot of most of 1:21:15 the time people are not getting paid to pitch stuff. I mean there are people there in the last I don't know 1:21:23 seven years or so I feel like there's at least an awareness of the amount of time 1:21:29 and effort and energy goes into even pitching these things. And so in some instances, especially um 1:21:38 uh governmental agencies or uh municipal agencies, like there's been a bunch of 1:21:44 things I've applied for recently where after the first round and they decided like, oh, we would love to see what 1:21:50 these people would do with this, like they had some sort of money available to 1:21:55 pay everyone to put a pitch together, you know, because they were doing it to like I don't know, five or six people 1:22:03 and so you know it wasn't great money but it was something so that you know 1:22:08 you're not putting all this work in for absolutely zero. Anyways uh this one's I think a pretty interesting take on 1:22:14 putting this kind of look together and then arranging these 2D assets in 3D 1:22:20 space here. 1:22:32 You have to pretend like you're going to work, get ready for your day, and then you 1:22:38 literally go on a walk around the block, which is most often what I do. Maybe a 1:22:43 coffee, maybe a breakfast. Just changing my mental state. And then you get to work and it also 1:22:50 happens to be your house, but your mind has shifted. My name is Eve Weinberg. I'm a motion 1:22:57 graphics art director. Right. working on a film title sequence and end credit 1:23:03 sequence. It's a dark comedy. It's about this 32-year-old golf caddy who still 1:23:09 lives with his mother in his basement and has daddy issues and writes a 1:23:15 graphic novel about it. I was given the script and some images and I just completely fell in love with 1:23:21 it. So that's when I began generating the artwork to create style frames. A 1:23:27 style frame is basically one frame that encompasses the entire look and feel of the video. 1:23:34 I'm one of those people that's been drawing since the day I was born. I was always painting, making art, drawing 1:23:41 things. So, the golf balls are flaming, so I decided to do that with finger paints. And just by them popping on one 1:23:48 after the other, it gives like this really crude handmade animated spot. 1:23:56 So I started with these style frames and I bring it into After Effects and I have all my layers. So one by one you just 1:24:02 have to bring this scene to life and you have to animate everything just a little bit so it feels shaky. Like even the 1:24:08 camera is like kind of finding the right moment like the camera it's as if a 1:24:13 person is filming a down shot of this guy working. But yeah, in two weeks I 1:24:19 think this thing will be done. I'll work from home for two months and then I'll go into a studio for about two months. 1:24:26 So two months is when I like meet co-workers again. 1:24:31 So really cool different sort of process here. And yeah the way 1:24:36 uh yeah what they handed off to her right in in a way a lot of things would go from animat storyboard to animatic. 1:24:43 Here she her style frames were made in a way that she could go from style frame to kind of like you know then the 1:24:50 distance between animatic and finished animation for this particular project is pretty is smaller than you know like a 1:24:57 full 3D pipeline or something like that. Um yeah, I thought that one was really 1:25:02 good. Um 1:25:33 And in terms of tools for doing this, so we'll make the starframes and the 1:25:40 storyboard. uh storyboard on the timeline, you know, our sort of first step animatic this 1:25:48 week. Um, and then starting to plan things out. Uh, being able to see what 1:25:53 you're doing, thinking if your thing's going to be in 3D space. Um, how to 1:26:00 think about how much of how much of the space you need to build. Um, 1:26:05 and that obviously varies a lot, right? Um, 1:26:10 in our situation where one person is working on it, you want to build just enough. You don't want to be constructing these whole things and that 1:26:15 you're never going to use. But in some of the bigger situations like the Ready Player One, which is essentially 1:26:22 completely animated, there's a handful of like live action things, maybe mostly 1:26:28 animated. Um the they did a bunch of things beforehand 1:26:37 in order to be able to be in the space and they used VR headsets for this. Um 1:26:45 and so Spielberg could sort of like wander around the virtual space and find 1:26:50 the shots that would become later. And so this here this when does this movie 1:26:55 come out? Like at least seven or eight years ago. This is sort of at the very front of that. And now there's even more 1:27:01 of this where things that we would associate with like postp production where you would shoot a character 1:27:07 against a green screen and then later somebody would make a whole bunch of stuff that would fill in the background. 1:27:12 That's becoming kind of flipped now at this point, right? The Mandalorian 1:27:17 famously filmed against, you know, the big volume screen. And so a lot of what 1:27:23 used to be the post-production of like making the 3D environments is now pre-production. They do all that 1:27:28 beforehand so they can be on the screen. It has to be on the screen when they shoot it so that they are able to, you 1:27:34 know, it's not being comped. It's like in in camera at that point. Um, and so 1:27:41 that allows for I mean every I I'll I don't have one up here, but I'll link to 1:27:46 a couple of the things. You know, the Mandalorian every and all the things they're shooting against the volume, the 1:27:52 big screen now, they talk about all the actors are like, \"Wow, this is really really great.\" because like I can see 1:27:59 stuff as opposed to just I'm against this green screen and there's a guy holding a tennis ball and I need to act 1:28:05 like that's a monster and you know um like you know I'm not an actor but like 1:28:11 that's clearly a compromised situation. And so now being able to see all that stuff and the flexibility like if they 1:28:16 shoot something and they're like, \"Oh, that rock's in the wrong place.\" Then you just go into the 3D software and move the rock over like like we would 1:28:24 afterwards, but you can do it beforehand. So like this really cool combination. This is super easy in 1:28:30 Blender. It's like practically built in at this point. So I'll bring all the as we start to build out the environments 1:28:36 next week for this project. Um, we'll have all the VR headsets and we can hook 1:28:43 them up because it's lit just to just to look at your Blender file in VR is just 1:28:49 a couple clicks. It's not a huge rigor role. Um, it doesn't let you move stuff 1:28:55 around and create there in that view, but you can look at it that way, which I 1:29:01 think is super useful. And the other, it's not I don't think it's in this video. I don't remember them talking 1:29:07 about it, but he um really wanted to drink coffee while he was in virtual 1:29:12 reality, but he couldn't see his cup or his mouth. So, they ended up making a tracking marker for his cup so that it 1:29:19 would show up in virtual reality and he wouldn't spill coffee on himself. 1:29:25 Yeah. I mean, it's the kind of stuff you can do if you're Steen Spielberg, you know. 1:29:39 And another resource here in terms of the 1:29:44 uh transition uh you know previsualization. This is a 1:29:50 there's a bunch of really good stuff on the Pixar YouTube channel. This is one of them. This is 1:30:00 There we go. sort of storyboard to, 1:30:06 you know, sort of a, you know, we kind of skipped animatic there and went to, 1:30:11 you know, a level of previsualization where, you know, we're blocking out the shots. You know, like obviously all of 1:30:18 the characters are going to get bespoke walk cycles later or just sort of sliding around. Here's the one, you 1:30:25 know, if you haven't seen the movie, there's like all these carnations carnations, right? carnation pedals on the ground here. And so like a giant 1:30:31 particle effect, some of you may also have particle effects in your thing. And 1:30:37 besides even in the style frame, the style frame, I would I would fake the 1:30:42 particle effect by comping in something at this point in 2D. Right now 1:30:48 is not the time to devote to the part. Even in Pixar here, like there's not the time to devote to the particle effect. 1:30:53 It gets layered in at the very very end. 1:31:01 There we go. 1:31:15 So a lot of great stuff there with that's one of the one where we could sort of see very specifically the 1:31:21 transition between those things the you know moving storyboard there animatic 1:31:27 into different levels of previs 1:31:34 Um 1:31:40 here 1:31:49 uh so this is uh yeah I mean this one really really 1:31:55 really close. Uh these are style frames for the Spider-Man 2 video game. 1:32:04 um end credit sequence. Um and 1:32:10 yeah, doing something different, you know, and for a lot of these either 1:32:16 completely animated, you know, computer animated or um you know, movies that you 1:32:24 don't think of as animation but are like completely computerenerated like Ready Player One. Um when they make the title 1:32:29 sequence, there's a big artistic hurdle there in terms of like 1:32:35 well we can't just make a cool looking CG thing because the whole movie is a cool looking CG thing right so what are 1:32:40 we going to do artistically that's separate from that and so this is one of those cases right like it's a video game 1:32:46 that I don't know hundreds if not thousands of people work on and so there's you know really really high 1:32:53 fidelity and so what could you do that's sort of separate from that um and so 1:32:59 that's the um 1:33:04 style frames and this is the actual thing. 1:33:15 There we go. So, another good example of like 1:33:21 certainly um 1:33:27 Pacific Rim uh situation. Uh we have definitely some 3D models and then 2D 1:33:35 assets comped into uh the 3D space. 1:33:44 So, lighting or applying shaders that are 2D in quality. And then, 1:33:54 you know, they're they also chose to make these things pretty freeze framed, right? And so, instead of something like 1:34:00 this being a long period of particle trail wrangling 1:34:06 to get this to happen, this is just like a drawn asset that is laid in over top. 1:34:13 And you know, same thing with all this like symbio goo or whatever else is happening here. 1:34:19 But um yeah, this is I mean when I was looking at other things to show you guys, I was surprised about I mean maybe 1:34:28 that post I showed you of the style frames was like somebody's Instagram post of who worked on this. So there 1:34:34 might have been some, you know, uh, Monday morning quarterbacking there in 1:34:39 terms of like here's some, you know, here's some style frames, otherwise known as renders from the final thing, 1:34:44 you know, like where, you know, what how much of this was actually done beforehand, but um, yeah, 1:34:54 and then, you know, much more modern treatment for the camera movement here in terms of the the camera's always sort 1:35:01 of slowly moving and then we have these ramps where we ease in and ease out of them. 1:35:08 It's really good. The 1:35:27 Another 1:35:42 nice uh comparison of a scene where we see, you know, essentially just raw 1:35:48 storyboard frames, some more fleshed out, you know, in this case colored kind 1:35:53 of animatic thing and then a level of the uh previs here at the end, right? 1:36:00 And so in a lot of especially in this case, you know, this ends up being like 1:36:07 a, you know, like a Blender viewport render of the scene, you know, with all 1:36:12 of like the very temp movement. Um, so 1:36:18 there's not the first person to be doing this, right? like the car is going to move across here in order to get 1:36:25 the like what's going to need to happen here? How much ground is someone going 1:36:31 to cover in this much time in the shot? Because all that would massively affect like the sort of, you know, walk run 1:36:37 animation that needs to happen there. So figuring that all out beforehand is 1:36:42 um critical. 1:36:49 But here in this narrative context, there's a much more there's a much higher bar in terms of like getting 1:36:55 everything some sort of correct temporal sequence of what's happen. It's like 1:37:00 this needs to happen, this needs to happen, this needs to happen. For the music video, things can be a little freer in that instance, right? like 1:37:07 we're gonna storyboard this out to the timeline, but in no way later. I mean, 1:37:14 maybe we could do something like this where you just sort of show what it was, what you planned and what you did, but 1:37:20 it's a much much freer format in terms of you find some other shots while you're making it and you mix those into 1:37:27 the stew while you're doing the music video there in terms of the editing. Um, that would be super important. 1:37:36 And um yeah, this was on the Blender site. 1:38:02 So somewhere in between previs and style frames. This is for uh the most recent 1:38:08 or not maybe the most recent Blender. 1:38:31 There you go. So the Blender scene that we 1:38:38 unsuccessfully tried to load earlier in the semester uh comes from their you know now they have Blender Studios 1:38:44 that's making um products with the tool. And so you recognize this guy when we 1:38:52 saw him for just a few seconds as Blender crashed um trying to load some of these scenes. Um and so this is uh 1:39:02 charge. I'll link to the whole thing here to look at it. But um this is part 1:39:08 of the you know style frames pitch frames for charge right. So obviously 1:39:15 these were done, you know, I imagine in Blender as like these really really crude um simple versions of the main 1:39:24 story beats from the entire narrative here. really focusing on the change in, 1:39:29 you know, color, tint, and quality and, you know, framing of the shots. And um 1:39:38 yeah, I thought this was, you know, maybe not quite style frame in that the 1:39:44 end product here ends up being way way more, you know, detailed and high fidelity than what we're seeing, but 1:39:51 successfully communicating um you know, the look and feel and 1:39:58 narrative structure and main visual landing points for the entire project 1:40:04 there. This was uh yeah I thought really interesting 1:40:15 then 1:41:30 Yeah. Okay. I think that was that was the main ones I wanted to show everybody there. 1:41:50 So, two things there from looking at those examples 1:42:02 from just implementation kind of thing. looking at some of this the 1:42:10 there's a lot of like concert slash um 1:42:19 club lighting stuff. And in terms of establishing some of that for the 1:42:28 style frames at least um 1:42:33 something al along these lines as a setup to do that kind of stuff. I 1:42:39 mean, we want some sort of big controllable volume. 1:43:01 Um, let's label this one. 1:43:10 So going towards creating some sort of art direct space uh to create that kind 1:43:15 of lighting. Uh I might 1:43:52 And let's save this. 1:44:09 And then let's bring in some lights. 1:44:17 And let's constrain the lights with the damp track and a actual 1:44:25 object. There we go. Going to move this down. And so our spot here 1:44:36 to our target light. 1:44:42 And here. 1:44:54 Cool. Let's save that. Let's see what it looks like. 1:45:00 And make this look something like what we want. 1:45:17 I think the volume needs to be a bit a little bit bigger. 1:45:28 And let's get rid of the other light. There we go. 1:45:33 All right. And so in here the spot 1:45:54 All right. And so let's have some sort of stage. 1:46:17 And so now with this in place, 1:46:22 something along the lines of here and then 1:46:29 saving and shift D, shift D, shift D, shift D. 1:46:40 All right. And coming back and down in here 1:46:53 for multiple things in Blender, the trick is holding down 1:46:59 alt when you drag. And so if you have multiple things 1:47:05 selected and you hold down alt when you drag, as long as they're the same thing, you can change it for all of the things 1:47:11 at the same time. So I can change all of these spotlights simultaneously. 1:47:17 And then the um other thing here for this like club 1:47:26 concert setting kind of thing. A lot of times the stage lighting has multiple different colors 1:47:33 and being able to mix those things up. Also having some sort of principled volume here might be 1:47:43 uh volume noise. But 1:48:05 the quality of what's going on here is going to be a lot of what's going on with the render. If we look at the EV 1:48:13 stuff here under 1:48:52 Uh, I'm going to do the the trick I was talking to Jack about earlier before. I'm going to flip the normals on this 1:48:57 cube. 1:49:31 Okay. So, now we can see a little bit of what's going on. Um, 1:49:39 if this is crashing the EV render, coming up here and doing the viewport 1:49:46 render image, there's been some instances where that crashed for me, but this did not. And so, especially in EV 1:49:53 where the viewport is going to be very close, that's going to help and may also 1:49:58 address some of the crash issues. But here, 1:50:04 right, this is EV doing the super fast version of the light bouncing around. 1:50:10 And so the sup what makes it super fast is number one, this setting right here, 1:50:16 it's only doing it for half as many pixels by default. And so 1:50:22 um you can if it's chugging, this can be even less. And you see what happened 1:50:27 there? see how noisy all of this junk gets right away, right? But now it's 1:50:33 like super fast um and easy to move around. But then when it comes time to, 1:50:39 you know, make the best looking one for the render, I can bump it down. Remember, by default, it's one to two, 1:50:45 but one is going to make it as good as it will be there. Um the rays is how 1:50:52 many times we're going to how many rays we're going to shoot. And then steps is how many times that's gonna bounce. And 1:50:59 so if that's like a one or actually can I put it at zero? Does it let me put it at zero? I don't think you wouldn't want 1:51:05 to do that. So you see that this wall is like way way way darker because it's really just 1:51:11 being ellipt. 1:51:21 We get the light coming down, bouncing, bouncing, bouncing. And so the you know just more and more photons accumulating 1:51:27 hitting the thing there. Um over here if this is a little bit higher 1:51:36 we have a little bit more a little bit softer. These are all super 1:51:42 sharp. So again I'm going to grab these and 1:51:58 soften that up quite a bit. And not only for posing the thing, but 1:52:05 also moving stuff around. Having these multiple lights hooked up to this one 1:52:11 target now allows me to do, you know, stage andor light animation here. Club 1:52:18 animation of this moving around. Where'd it go? There it goes. Right. So, again, I'm just they every light has a damped 1:52:25 track on there. They're all pointing at the one thing. And so, yeah, for your 1:52:30 dead mouse thing, like so. Um, 1:52:38 the 1:53:10 and then if we turn the volume back on kind have to balance the thickness of 1:53:17 the volume with the brightness of the lights. So, if we want to have a stronger light 1:53:24 beam there, and then we need to have um we want a more evident one, we need 1:53:32 to make this thicker, but then offset it over here. So, grabbing all of these and 1:53:39 being able to dial this up. 1:54:08 One of them I set way out of bounds. 1:54:30 So, as long as we're in EV here, we're getting like I mean, you could package 1:54:35 up this whole thing now as its own, you know, asset and use this 1:54:43 throughout the project or use multiple versions of it throughout the project. 1:54:48 If we look at how something would fall into this light here. 1:54:59 So, a lot to balance there between the actual volume and the lights. Um, 1:55:07 yeah. And then being aware of this over here, 1:55:13 how much work we're actually doing. 1:55:20 The threshold is like the threshold at which uh it stops working to resolve the 1:55:26 noise. And so, um, 1:55:31 by far the biggest effect is going to be how much resolution there is. And then if 1:55:37 everything's really chugging, definitely dialing that around so you can look and 1:55:42 move around in a much more effective way with what you're doing there. 1:55:51 So the other if we had something like 1:55:57 the Spider-Man situation here, 1:56:03 let me make a camera. 1:56:11 Look through said camera. Delete the other camera. 1:56:18 Delete it. There we go. Grab this one. Look through this. Control on Z. 1:56:26 There we go. Um 1:57:17 So I would make a new plane 1:57:26 and then like let's say this is going to be a 2D asset that we use you know in 1:57:31 the style frames and then something is going to be uh part of the project later on like this. We'll call this like 1:57:39 essentially kind of like a sprite here. Um but if we did the same thing with 1:57:45 this the damped track here. Um but let's point it at 1:57:51 the camera. And 1:57:57 there we go. And so now if I were to scale this down, tab S. 1:58:09 There we go. Tab. And so if I look through the camera here, zero. 1:58:16 And stay looking through the camera. 1:58:49 So this stays pointed at our camera. 1:58:57 We have the flipping which is not great. I thought I remember this having like an up vector. Is that the other one? Damped 1:59:04 track. Locked track. 1:59:54 Now we can solve it in a simpler way. So if you had a 2:00:09 axis, so just an empty. 2:00:20 And let's make this the point at camera. 2:00:26 And then this gets a damped track to 2:00:31 the camera. Take our sprite and shift drag it 2:00:38 underneath this. There we go. And 2:00:43 does our sprite still have the constraint? No. Okay. And so if we were to move around, that's moving. 2:00:51 We can take the sprite and rotate it relative to what's happening 2:00:59 in order to compensate for any weirdness that's happening there. 2:01:18 And so later once you apply things, you could move 2:01:29 this as it's staying flat to the camera moving around. Let's apply 2:01:37 a splatter or some sort of 2D effect to it. So on this one, if I grabbed a new 2:01:43 material and brought in something with an alpha channel of any kind 2:02:45 There we go. 2:02:53 So, kind of being able to put these two to 3D things around. So, if this moves, 2:03:00 I can move the camera. Still kind of stays flat to the camera. I can manage the rotation as a child object here if I 2:03:07 want it oriented differently. If I wanted multiple of these things, if I grab both of them, 2:03:14 shift D. Go 2:03:30 depending on how I would want them to look. Let's save this file. 2:03:51 So, both of those things interacting there. Be able to spread these around wherever you would want in the scene, 2:03:57 but be able to move this around and still have them interact with the geometry here. So, 2:04:04 you know, this is pointing at the camera. This is a child of it to compensate for the rotation depending on how you want it to be there, but allows 2:04:12 for those same kind of things to move around in the scene in terms of the style frames. 2:04:25 What do you guys think in terms of like making the storyboard and the style frames for your project? 2:04:32 Does anybody have anything that's like completely you're completely drawing a blank on how you would do something? 2:04:43 All that's standing between you and complete success is time. 2:05:06 I could do like fireworks. Well, I I would do fireworks this way 2:05:12 now. Like cut out some fireworks and put them on a plane in the scene. 2:05:21 So later that would have to be a particle effect, but I would not wrangle the 2:05:27 particle effect for the style frame, right? So 2:05:33 any image of fireworks on a plane, make sure it's flat to the camera and you 2:05:38 could put a mission on it and you get all your glow and business there as well. 2:05:45 But it's achievable later down the road. 2:05:50 Yeah. 2:05:56 Anything else? How's your day? 2:06:03 It's a rough week for me. 2:06:13 Okay. Well, I'll give you some more time to because that's the only thing you guys need right now. Okay. Awesome. So, 2:06:21 like Tuesday clear on what we want. We want the music with the storyboard 2:06:26 animatic. Very minimal. Just thinking about how it's going to play out in time. And then at least one style frame 2:06:32 where like I got as close to what I want this to look like as possible. If you're going to have two major different looks 2:06:39 or something or different sections or different sets, it might make sense to make more than one style frame depending 2:06:44 on your setup, but allows you to address both things. 2:06:50 And once you have those two things in place, I think, you know, the style frame really helps lock in exactly what 2:06:57 workflow is going to make sense to try and get to that in a production 2:07:02 environment. And then the storyboards are going to help quite a bit in terms of, you know, is this going to what is 2:07:10 what you have planned going to work in time with the rest of what is happening here. 2:07:17 Sound good? Okay, let's call it. I don't think anybody looks like just Angie 2:07:22 there. Alex Alec may have collapsed out of exhaustion. So,"

Uh because they fit really well into the subdivision surface workflow. And if we're able to use the subdivision surface modifier, that allows us to sort of arbitrarily and procedurally give our object more smoothness, which is very flexible, right? Because then when we're closer to an object, we're able to turn up the subdivision to give it more detail in its silhouette. And when we're further away, we could dial that down in order to give it less polygons. then um it would be faster to render and easier to use. But that works really well dialing up and down quads when they're part of a subd surface workflow. Um the subd becomes not so great when we have anything but quads, something like engon, right? How many sides in an engon. >> Uh well, more than four, right? Because three we're usually going to say try, right? And so um this when you subdivide this, you tend to get shading irregularities. Uh and when we subdivide quads, it's not, you know, impossible to get shading irregularities, but it just tends to be much much more solid. So that's just from a visual presentation standpoint.

However, um, as we've learned, controlling the density of the topology uh is important in that when you have smaller details, you need more quads to represent those details. And when you have uh less detail, a smoother service, you don't need as much. You'd be wasting topology and data and possibly increasing render time by having denser topology on those areas. So you need some way to keep things quads, but then also be able to control where it's dense and where it's not. And so that's what you're looking at here in this chart is that these are different schemes, different specific plans for um in this direction they are decreasing density and then in this direction they are increasing density. And so um for instance something like a hand. This is a good model for what might be happening uh on a hand uh or the hand that's connected to an arm where there'd be some sort of area and then a wrist area that needs to get more topology. And so you go four to two. And then maybe there's another section coming up up here where the we actually need to get down to the fingers. And so we do another four to two conversion there in order to get enough detail to reproperly represent the fingers, but then not have that detail be equally distributed throughout the entire surface of the object. And yeah, uh in I believe these are all all quads except for the two to one situation where you have this one try in the middle there. Uh the rest of them if I'm looking at it correctly when they're four to one they put no that's a one two three four. So some different schemes then what we see over here is like this is what happens when you run those topologies through the subd with the cat mole Clark subd smoothing right as we know now the subdivision surface modifier has two modes right one where it's subdividing and not smoothing the surface. We're just doing this essentially and the other one where it is and that's the Catal Clark. And so you can see how this results in um something where we're going to get edge loops. The edge flow changes a little bit here in that we get these edges that sort of loop around and back depending on what's going on, but we still get uh edge loops as opposed to just sort of arbitrarily connecting a bunch of dots together and not really think about the way that the edge loop flows. You'll find a bunch of different versions of these. This is another one I use and that it's sort of progressing um along multiple axes here. Uh and so you know like this pink part is a two to one, right? And so even though this looks weird, this is still a quad here. And here's a one to three, right?

And yep, that's right. 2 0 06 m. I don't think that's right. >> Is that right? 2 meters. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. And so um this is our again we'll call it uh bounding box and just like before process is the same. Now we come into our reference image and scale this down so that we get um everything happening. I'm going to go uh this way and then uh you know it's just much easier to model things in the center of the world. So I'm going to try and align uh the fork as best I can here. Now um yeah as best you can. Right. So especially the the one for the table and chairs what I gave you was um like a computer rendered blueprint, right? And so here when you have something that's clearly like a photograph, it's not going to line up exa, especially because it's not in the middle of the frame. No matter which camera you're using, it's going to have some kind of lens distortion. And so you've got to use it uh sparingly here in terms of you want to get, you know, this lined up as close as we can, but knowing that you're not going to be able to get it perfect. Um, and it's really going to be needed need to be a guide here for what we're doing."

So, with that in mind, uh, the tines of the fork were way too pointy. And so, you know what? I'm going to keep that stuff on. So, we can check in with it there. And, uh, so this is what's happening right now. This is not what we want to do, right? Because it does this is how it reacts with the subdurface. we have this problem and we can correct this if we tab back in here and start looking at uh this view of it. Uh we need more control here. As what I just said implies, we need a controlling edge. We need to create another loop cut around the very end of the tines in order to avoid this and have more control over what that works like. So that's easy. That's just a when your topology is good, it's just a loop cut, right? Um when topology is bad, then it's like maybe a big problem because then you got to figure out like how am I going to uh create an extra loop cut there. And so you can see how this fixes the problem immediately there, right? We're able to now really have control over what the end of these things looks like. They're a little too stubby now, but we can uh have explicit control over that by um adjusting these uh these points here. So, we can move these in to get a little bit more. And also as we increase or decrease the subdivision level, we'll get a much better result. Turn these off for now. Uh one of the other areas where uh things are happening is here in the middle. Okay. So um we may need where this this ends up being a um pole here and there's some change in the topology. So adding another loop cut can help control some of that and also give you more control over how this topology where the tines are actually uh coming out looks.

    "transcript_segment": "Okay, we'll come back. Let's get a little bit more work done here to uh get this going. So, with that in mind, uh, the tines of the fork were way too pointy. And so, you know what? I'm going to keep that stuff on. So, we can check in with it there. And, uh, so this is what's happening right now. This is not what we want to do, right? Because it does this is how it reacts with the subdurface. we have this problem and we can correct this if we tab back in here and start looking at uh this view of it. Uh we need more control here. As what I just said implies, we need a controlling edge. We need to create another loop cut around the very end of the tines in order to avoid this and have more control over what that works like. So that's easy. That's just a when your topology is good, it's just a loop cut, right? Um when topology is bad, then it's like maybe a big problem because then you got to figure out like how am I going to uh create an extra loop cut there. And so you can see how this fixes the problem immediately there, right? We're able to now really have control over what the end of these things looks like. They're a little too stubby now, but we can uh have explicit control over that by um adjusting these uh these points here. So, we can move these in to get a little bit more. And also as we increase or decrease the subdivision level, we'll get a much better result. Turn these off for now. Uh one of the other areas where uh things are happening is here in the middle. Okay. So um we may need where this this ends up being a um pole here and there's some change in the topology. So adding another loop cut can help control some of that and also give you more control over how this topology where the tines are actually uh coming out looks. And then down here, in order to create more of a loop, you probably want some loop cuts here. Start to create more of that, you know, fat end handle over there.

Um, and so now if we were to grab points and press G, you can see it gives us this much softer sort of situation. Um, and that may be super useful here. So if I were to uh turn on this to make sure that I'm selecting through. And so now I can tell exactly which parts I'm selecting because I can see it over here as I'm dragging over here. And so we know we want this to be kind of rounded. And so I may actually rotate uh a little bit here like this. And then press G and move these up. Actually, I might rotate first in not proportional mode to allow me to sort of create more of that angle. Maybe a little bit too much. There we go. And then in the middle here after it makes that if I grab maybe some of this right there. Um, now back to proportional mode. I might make this even smaller. 05. And if we press maybe there. So proportional editing means like the the ones you move the ones you have selected are going to get moved 100%. And then as it goes out from that center of the selection you'll get a smaller and smaller percentage of whatever transform it is that you're doing there. But the problem is dialing in to be about what you want because you can't see it in the view. You can see it as soon as you press G. Now that circle is representing the length of it. But uh when you're doing this, it doesn't show up, which is a little not great.

So, it's important to keep this like like I said, some sort of relatively even subdivision allows you to create these curves. Creating this curve in the handle would be tough if there were no subdivisions between here and here, right? Uh it would be kind of a straight line. There would be subdivisions created by the subV surface, but you wouldn't be able to sort of control the curve.

Um so that I have this level of smoothness for my painting and my UV unwrapping. And so when you do that, make sure that both these numbers are the same so that you don't if I apply this, I'm gonna get this number, not that number. So again, just make sure both numbers are the same. Um, the only other issue here is how round do I want the edge of the silverware to be? And so if I tab back out, adding an edge loop along the length, which should be a piece of cake because we just controlRr and it finds a super clean edge loop around the entire piece of geometry. If I add one edge loop there and then tab back out, you can see that that does a little bit to uh now interact with the subd service to make this like a little bit less rounded like turning it into just a very very round um handle. So it's your call there depending on how rounded you would want it to be. But now I want to bake in that level of subdivision. And so I'm going to apply that. And now I feel good about this. and saving incremental. So, I've got this trail if I want to go back and make some changes later. And because I've got this very clean edge loop around the middle, unwrapping my fork should be a pretty easy peasy process. Um, if we look over here at the um UV editing and look at the fork here, right? And I'm going to add a seam right here. So, I'll altclick to select around. Right click and mark seam. And that should be it. Let's see over here. We're going to grab all of these A and then um U and unwrap. And you see that gives me top fork, bottom fork pretty cleanly there. Our only issues are what are we going to do with the times? And what are we going to do with the metal pattern? So, a lot like these might have like a sort of metal pattern running on them. And so, um, having just like the wood grain, like do we need that to, um, if we want that to go straight along the fork, then we would want to straighten this out perhaps here in the UV view. So, I mean, I might just straighten these out. uh ctrl l r at least to run straight up and down and then ctrl l r knowing that I'm going to pack in this case we can pack the other pieces of silverware into the same um map here same UV space so that we can paint them together, you know, all having because we're going to mostly be looking at a big scene here on a table. And so having all of these uh available there actually does that actually work here on the end? Yeah, it does go around. So I mean there is a seam here on the very end of it, but like uh yeah, I mean it would just depend on what you want. you I could also see a case for placing the seam there so that the top side was like one uh face wider than the bottom side, you know, because how much you going to look at the bottom side of the fork? Pretty minor, right? This is definitely going to work for us. Um in terms of UV layout here, um what about relaxing I mean, this is going to work great. The other thing we might want to check in with here might be the view. Where is it? It is. Yeah. UV stretch. So if you turn that on, this shows you a heat map. This is kind of like the weight painting thing of where it stretches more or less. The bright yellows being areas where it stretches more. I mean, again, this is pretty clean, right? Again, the for this spaceship, I want people to just do some work. Just get in there, use the programs. Not everything went exactly as you wanted. That's fine. Um, now we're just sort of being a little bit more precise about it here. And yeah, you can see like how easily the UV unwrapping process goes when the modeling process was tightly controlled, right? Um, becomes a a piece of cake there. So, uh, yeah, we're not seeing much distortion in any of those at all there. Cool. That's looking good. Um, let's go ahead and save this and look at some of the uh Substance Painter parts of this.",
    "transcript_segment": "about right. Um in my case in that I want I feel like I want to bake in this level of subdivision at least. Um so that I have this level of smoothness for my painting and my UV unwrapping. And so when you do that, make sure that both these numbers are the same so that you don't if I apply this, I'm gonna get this number, not that number. So again, just make sure both numbers are the same. Um, the only other issue here is how round do I want the edge of the silverware to be? And so if I tab back out, adding an edge loop along the length, which should be a piece of cake because we just controlRr and it finds a super clean edge loop around the entire piece of geometry. If I add one edge loop there and then tab back out, you can see that that does a little bit to uh now interact with the subd service to make this like a little bit less rounded like turning it into just a very very round um handle. So it's your call there depending on how rounded you would want it to be. But now I want to bake in that level of subdivision. And so I'm going to apply that. And now I feel good about this. and saving incremental. So, I've got this trail if I want to go back and make some changes later. And because I've got this very clean edge loop around the middle, unwrapping my fork should be a pretty easy peasy process. Um, if we look over here at the um UV editing and look at the fork here, right? And I'm going to add a seam right here. So, I'll altclick to select around. Right click and mark seam. And that should be it. Let's see over here. We're going to grab all of these A and then um U and unwrap. And you see that gives me top fork, bottom fork pretty cleanly there. Our only issues are what are we going to do with the times? And what are we going to do with the metal pattern? So, a lot like these might have like a sort of metal pattern running on them. And so, um, having just like the wood grain, like do we need that to, um, if we want that to go straight along the fork, then we would want to straighten this out perhaps here in the UV view. So, I mean, I might just straighten these out. uh ctrl l r at least to run straight up and down and then ctrl l r knowing that I'm going to pack in this case we can pack the other pieces of silverware into the same um map here same UV space so that we can paint them together, you know, all having because we're going to mostly be looking at a big scene here on a table. And so having all of these uh available there actually does that actually work here on the end? Yeah, it does go around. So I mean there is a seam here on the very end of it, but like uh yeah, I mean it would just depend on what you want. you I could also see a case for placing the seam there so that the top side was like one uh face wider than the bottom side, you know, because how much you going to look at the bottom side of the fork? Pretty minor, right? This is definitely going to work for us. Um in terms of UV layout here, um what about relaxing I mean, this is going to work great. The other thing we might want to check in with here might be the view. Where is it? It is. Yeah. UV stretch. So if you turn that on, this shows you a heat map.

And so we want to leave these input sliders the same. Don't smush any of the incoming contrast. We just don't want it to go from between maximum white and maximum black. And so if we start to bring these in here, we see it getting grayer, but we get this very, very, very subtle variation in the gray there. And so depending on how dark you would want some of this to go. And now here you sort of move it one direction, the other. But if you move this really far, a bunch of it gets smooshed to 100% white. move this left, it's going to smush up some of it to 100% black, which is just a slightly darker gray in our case. Keeping it in the middle gives us the maximum amount of individual subtle variations. Okay, that feels good for the color. Now, let's go to the metallic and uh enable that. There we go. And we want things to be fairly metallic. And so, that's going to mean it's going to be over on this end. um maybe not 100% but here now we're getting some individual variation based on this this right so moving the light remember shift right click is move the light around and so especially on metal objects like this um being able to move the light around so you can really see how it starts to add this much more interesting specular highlight to things. This is where CG materials can really uh look good or bad. The simple ones will look unrealistically simple. It's just a sort of nothing ever is that simple. And then under roughness here, we have to enable it. There we go. And of course, you know, we're just like maximum contrast here. We want it to be fairly shiny. And so that's going to be uh down here. Uh, so moving the output down. I mean, you can see just how it just totally came to life there with that one, right? Like like that was a big difference right here. It's like really weird. And now it's getting shinier, but it's still giving you this really interesting um change in what's happening. Right? So now we have, you know, a metal that's way more interesting than what we had before. And it's being completely driven by this one mask, right? Uh this one um pattern. And we you could achieve the same thing if you drug the same pattern into this, this, and this. But then if you change the pattern, they wouldn't align, right? Um, and now this also gives us the flexibility to add some other stuff like let's have some speckles along with this perhaps. You know, we have this stretched base, but let's have some variation along with it. And so we can add another fill. Um, in fact, make sure to move the anchor point up to the top. And so here, um, let's get some spot. We got the stretchy noise. I'm going to try this one. There we go. And so you see that that's giving us this spotty noise, but it's not. We've lost the other one. It's totally covering up the other pattern. I mean, this is kind of interesting as it's up, but I kind of want both. And so now I need to this is totally covering up this because they're both in the normal blend mode. And here I let's say I could experiment here. I could you know I would start with what if I brighten the one below with the one above. Okay. What if I multiply darken the one below with the one above? That's definitely a little bit more successful in this instance. And so now if I were to look around here, you know, it's the stretchy pattern is the base. But then, you know, again, you can sort of mix in more or less of that to make it work. And then maybe experiment with some other blend modes. What if it was overlay? There we go. That's a little bit more interesting. And then sort of dialing in how much of that we want. Feels [clears throat] like perhaps a bit too shiny under roughness here. Start to expand some of this upward a little bit. Get some rougher sections in there. Yeah, there we go. Like that. [snorts] That looks good. And now perhaps this does influence the height just very very slightly. And so on the same level we can read uh the height here. Again, read the same anchor point. Um and of course add a levels to get this under control. And uh here. There we go. Bring these way in. Right. So that's giving me that next level of pop in terms of surface detail. knowing that, you know, in my final render environment, maybe I I would error on the side of this maybe being a bit strong and knowing that I can dial it down later. Um, yeah. And so here, you know, a couple different ways in the height mix Cool. So that feels just like a way more convincing surface, right, than just um you know, right?

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 03, 2025 Creating Ring Details with Path Tool uh, I'm going to go ahead and create a new fill and then go ahead and add a black mask. And in here, let's use that path tool. Sort of get around. There we go. And so the the path tool is a little weird, you know, vector pen drawing, but in the um mask. So sometimes moving some of these points is a little click. Let's use that for now. Okay. So, that's good. Uh the path itself, the size, so I can really bring that in even more. Cool. And that's in the mask. And so this will be uh ring detail. And let's go ahead and work with this a little bit. So over here we want to do something in the color. Um we want this to be way darker right there. We want to do something in the height. Going to bring this in. And we need to soften up there in terms of the height. And so we need to add a filter. And we want to blur this. Um but only on actually um if we blur the mask, it does both the color and the height which is not what we want here in this instance. Uh we just want to blur the height. Adding the blur filter here won't work, I believe, because it's reading the mask information. Let's just test that. I think that's correct. Yeah, because this is sort of applying it to the entire channel. So, okay, this gives us what we want, but um for the color, but then let's read it one level up. So, um, here we'll just grab the color and then let's say the roughness make it very not rough and then like that. Okay, that gives us a pretty hard ring. And let's read this up level. So now one more up. This will be ring height. Since it's on a separate layer, we'll be able to add a individual effect. And so here, just on the height, we'll read the anchor point that we haven't created yet, which is needs to be here. So, right click and say anchor point. Notice how I'm usually using the anchor points on the mask. Sort of simplifies the anchor point process because it's only one channel. I don't [snorts] need to then go back and make sure that the anchor point is that I'm reading the correct channel on the anchor point. So up here under height, let's read that anchor point. So ring detail mask. There it goes. And so now I can apply a filter at the top level and that will work. And let's look at some possibilities here. So, we may want one to go up before it goes down. If I duplicate this and then in the height here, uh, we're reading the same thing. We have the blur. Um, but let's go ahead and put the levels on the height. and an invert. There we go. And so this uh I'm gonna put this at the base. I don't know if it's gonna make much of a difference here. Um and now Let's see if we can make that any puffier. Um, we might be able to do that. So, balancing the levels of the height here with the size of the blur intensity can start to give us what we want. It might just be too blurred. That's close. The other thing I might try here is what about the blur off but giving it the mask outliner. So that gives us that really strong break there. We have a little bit of this happening around it. Um yeah, I mean depending on how much you want to mess with this, but again it's all reading this anchor point. [snorts] So here in this mask, in addition to using the pen tool here, you could um create additional detail with this if you wanted like so. And we're doing all the anchor point stuff where it evaluates up the chain um and allows for all of this to go the whole way up, right? And be re-evaluated. A little too strong there. Let's look for some other level stuff. So, this is all good. I like the ring here, but let's package all of this stuff up as it starts to get more and more unwieldy here. Let's save. And then let's uh make a folder. And so this is a ring detail. And let's put this stuff in there. So here, here, and here. Everything that's essentially being fed by that anchor point, right?

Um, that's a matter of, you know, let's get some obvious dirt here. I'm going to make it, you know, crazy color so that we can see it. and then use a smart mask cavity onto here. And it works for the thing, but not on any of these details because it's not referencing those because we need them with the anchor point. And so on the bevel feature, we need to add an anchor point. There we go. And then in the smart mask editor, we need to read from that anchor point with the micro details. And so this is going to be micro height true. And down here under micro height, we need to read that anchor point bevel feature. And there's always and then you need to make sure that you're reading the height channel. Is that going to work? It's clearly not. Let's just make sure up here micro height. True. Yeah. So, this is one of those deals where the actual detail is in the mask. That's where we painted the thing. So, let's get rid of that. On the mask is where we need to add the anchor point. There we go. And then up here, we need to read that micro point. Boom. Uh, and then we don't have that extra problem of making sure we have the correct channel because it's the only channel in the mask. Uh, there we go. And so now um yeah the grunge balance to this and the micro detail intensity here. Bring in more or less of it. There we go. That gives us that kind of like little bit of action there.

Maybe make a different decision on the color there depending on what it is. Maybe there's a little bit of height effect. Nice. So, we get that really nice sort of transition in and out of that. There we have our base layer which is really working for us. Now, we're able to put these details into it. And down here in the bevel features, yeah, this is the paint that covered it up. You can have multiple paint layers here. So um I'm going to turn on. Where is it? Over here. Lazy mouse. Yeah, there we go. Super lazy. My mouse is too lazy. Can't even move it.",

I'm going to make it, you know, crazy color so that we can see it. and then use a smart mask cavity onto here. And it works for the thing, but not on any of these details because it's not referencing those because we need them with the anchor point. And so on the bevel feature, we need to add an anchor point. There we go. And then in the smart mask editor, we need to read from that anchor point with the micro details. And so this is going to be micro height true. And down here under micro height, we need to read that anchor point bevel feature. And there's always and then you need to make sure that you're reading the height channel. Is that going to work? It's clearly not. Let's just make sure up here micro height. True. Yeah. So, this is one of those deals where the actual detail is in the mask. That's where we painted the thing. So, let's get rid of that. On the mask is where we need to add the anchor point. There we go. And then up here, we need to read that micro point. Boom. Uh, and then we don't have that extra problem of making sure we have the correct channel because it's the only channel in the mask. Uh, there we go. And so now um yeah the grunge balance to this and the micro detail intensity here. Bring in more or less of it. There we go. That gives us that kind of like little bit of action there.

So, uh, let's look at the template here I have to hand off to you guys of a project that's going to have all of the stuff that we need for game building here. Um, so this is called event game game toolkit because it's a toolkit that uses Unity events. So, I thought that was a good name. Um the whole idea here is that you have a game object. This is review more or less. Um and then uh that game object can um send signals to other objects um using um Unity events. It can do this multiple times. So there can be many outputs here of Unity events. Most of the time these are based on um an event that gets sent out is based on did something happen. If so then the event gets sent out. So, did the character jump? Did the timer run out? Did the player come in contact with a trigger zone? Something like that. And so that when the game object reaches some sort of state, the whole thing gets triggered and sends out a Unity event. on the other side. Unity events talk to um functions and this gives instructions you know do something. In our understanding of coding, functions are verbs, variables are nouns, and each script that goes on a game object. Um, there's multiple functions. And so this type of thing here, it could be start countdown and then the game object with the script on it manages the whole counting down business. And then when the countdown is finished, it sends out a Unity event which then goes on. Right? So this is what we're using before, but I'm just sort of explicitly laying it out here. And we can use this system and these Unity events to construct a bunch of logic in the game without having to go in and directly access a bunch of C sharp by essentially doing things like this where we chain these things together. Sometimes the chain is not uh from one object to another object. There's plenty of instances where it kind of does uh this where it's sort of sending an event that triggers something on the same object. That happens occasionally, but a lot of things can happen like this where we have multiple objects uh that have a function that kicks things off. code evaluates something, sends out a Unity event, uh, calling a function to another game object, so on and so forth. There's no limit to how big these chains, um, can be. And so this is the fundamental idea. you've already worked with this in the you know ball game but sort of expanded the whole thing into sort of a more capable um system. So",

Um, there may be other things in the template just, you know, I'll give you a full project. Okay? So, it'll be a zip file to a project and you open up that project and start your game there. Okay. Um, but just for the sake of documentation there, this kit is built on a couple other packages um that you probably just want to take note of. It is dependent, meaning that it doesn't work without the following. Uh, one is Cinemachine because we're going to use that because it's great. Uh, and so if you don't if these are hard dependencies, meaning that if they're not already in the template, and they will already be in the template that I hand off, then you would get an error saying like, hey, this it's expecting all this code and it doesn't see it. And the other one is a new one, uh, due tween. And so due tween is, um, a free asset. There's two versions. There's a free one and a paid one. And so this is um pro definitely like hands down the best um animation and interpolation library for Unity in terms of animating things outside of the animator. Being able to just sort of like tween things between two positions, two colors, two rotations, two literally anything. Um, and so it's uh really quite quite good. Like pretty much every Unity project I've ever done has this in it. Um, it I don't know why they just haven't bought this add-on and added it to the official thing. Um, but the those are two hard dependencies. So just for your information, but these will already be in the template there. This doesn't mean you can't add other assets like whatever other environmental assets or particle assets like we brought in or we'll look at the terrain asset thing. All of those will be you can also bring those things in and certainly if it's an asset that's primarily functioned primarily pointed towards game environmental game objects. Those don't tend to have as much scripting in them. It's conceivable that you could find some project some asset that has scripts that conflict with these. although you know I haven't bumped into it. So it's important to know that if you do go and add more assets to your project template you want to add the project add the packages through the package man appropriately named package manager. And if you do add something here, like you go to my assets, you you're looking around on the Unity asset store and you find something that's free that you think might work with your game, you bring it in and then you add it through here. You know, you first have to download it and then you import it into the project. So, it's always a two-step process. And um then at that point I would pay careful attention to the console to see that like once I add this project does my console just blow up with a ton of errors of one kind or another? Uh if so I would immediately go back to the package manager and remove said asset. Okay. and you send me a note at that point if it's something that's going to be mission critical and I can try and see what the what the deal is. But that's if there's going to be a problem, it's going to emerge immediately and so um you want to not ignore this window. I realize that the stuff that comes through on the console can be cryptic, but uh it's important to know Is there like a ghosting on the screen? >> I have to check these things now where it's like am I am I having a stroke or is something actually happening, right? Like no, it's okay. All right. Weird. um over here, right? Uh red error um is going to be 90% of the time something that's going to keep the game from compiling, right? And so you won't be able to go compile. No, you won't be able to go into play mode because you won't be able to evaluate all the scripts and run the code. And unfortunately, this is always like an all or nothing situation. If there's any slight problem, the whole thing is it's not corrupted, but it's un it's un able to be compiled. It won't run. We you've all run into this to some extent at this point already. Uh a yellow one is not going to stop the game from compiling. And in a lot of in some instances, it's really more of a Unity housekeeping message where they're saying like, \"Hey, heads up. Eventually, we're going to get rid of this thing that you're using. So, be aware of that.\" But it usually doesn't have much bearing on what we're doing in class. Uh, and then, uh, white. So, you know, yellow is lookout and white is usually a debug message where either the code I've written or some other code that you're using writes some sort of message to the console that you can use to um you can use this to uh know what's going on when it's not very visually obvious, right? Um like is it sending this Unity event because it doesn't seem like it is. Um and we can sort of set those things up visually like like we'll make this let's let's simplify it and make this cube appear. This cube appears we know this event was sent and then we can troubleshoot the rest of it from there. So um so do pay attention to this. In fact, I'm going to do this and put it over there so that I don't, you know, I can if it blows up at any point and there's like a gabillion errors, I I'll be like, \"Oh, okay.

Um, but the only downside is that this sort of visual flow of information isn't really readily apparent in the editor, the way everything is set up, right? in that we put these scripts on the objects and the events are very visual because they're listed in these scripts, but the functions are kind of hidden because we have to select the game object that we're sending a message to and then navigate those nested dropdowns in order to find the functions. So, in order to alleviate that, I put this in there. So, um it's not very visual.

Um, but the only downside is that this sort of visual flow of information isn't really readily apparent in the editor, the way everything is set up, right? in that we put these scripts on the objects and the events are very visual because they're listed in these scripts, but the functions are kind of hidden because we have to select the game object that we're sending a message to and then navigate those nested dropdowns in order to find the functions. So, in order to alleviate that, I put this in there. So, um it's not very visual. And so I thought about that and I was like, what if we could um visualize at least the um inputs and outputs of the individual scripts that are part of the system. And so in the documentation folder um well actually I'm just going to make a new blank scene here just called documentation. And then in the project up here under tools this is um you know if you install a new add-on and it has some sort of global level stuff happening almost always that happens up here under tools. And so that's where these things are"

That's the first time there's ever been a problem with that. It's usually rock solid. There we go. Um over here the documentation. So check it out. I made a new blank scene. I called it documentation. Up here under tools um there is a script documentation generator. And so if you open up this, it opens up this window. And uh I have to tell it where to go here. In this case, it's going to be the event game toolkit, the folder where everything is. And then um in here runtime I'll have that configured for you so you don't have to type that in. But if I do that and I say generate documentation um there it goes. And so it looked through the entire uh runtime folder, which is the folder that actually has all of the functional stuff in it, and generates this um visualizer of all of the functions, all of the scripts that are part of the system. And in here um these are set up according to the paradigm I just described. Inputs on the left, outputs on the right. And each script has its own um sort of description and then what where can you send information to it? What can you tell it to do with an event? And then also what events does it output? And so by chaining these things together, we can construct a bunch of logic that way. And I've tried to organize them here uh according to animation. So yeah, this animation script, we'll look at that um actions. And so this is a lot of the chaining together of things here will be under actions. uh the character controllers, uh some game management stuff, some different things to handle input. Um, but it's all here, right? I'm not going to cover each one, but a lot of you, depending on what you're doing, may use different ones here. And so having it all in one place where you can just sort of peruse it, I think, is super useful. Um and it all gets set up like so. And uh because it's dynamic meaning that you the these instruct this visualization is generated by code um if we tweak the system and you update it you just need to regenerate the documentation and then the it would be updated as well which is cool.

There's no reason to do that, but this is there to look at. Um and we'll come back and reference it when we need to. There. Um, great.

Remember, the UI is like gigantic compared to the screen itself. And so, if I just click on the player, have my mouse over here, and press F, you know, comes back to back to there. Um, okay, great. So, with that in mind, um, let's look at a few things. The character controller is independent of the Cinem machine camera object. The way the character figure out figures out where it's moving is based on it keeps the air the wazda aligned with what however you're looking at the character at that time because the thing about Cinem Machine is that it has this whole construct that we create these other Cinem Machine cameras but they're actually not quoteunquote real cameras. What's happening behind the scenes is that the main camera is kind of being interpolated or matched to one of these Cinem Machine constructs dynamically, which allows you to switch between them and all of that kind of business. Uh, and so because of that, the Cinem Machine camera that we were using for the ball game is not 100% necessary here. Even when I don't have that in play at all right now, the character controller still works because it's looking for the main camera, which is always tagged main camera. So, don't ever change that. Um, and then orienting the WASDA according to whatever the view is when that happens, right? And so if I were to move the main camera in any way like this or like this, then when I click back in here, the character controller still functions as long as you remember to look over here and not look over here, right? Because this is just some arbitrary view at which you're viewing the scene. This is the main camera view. That's actually the one that matters for all of the movement evaluation. The character controller we talked some about before. There'll be a character controller prefab in the prefabs folder here. So player with character controller to add all the animations and everything. the um it has a bunch of dependencies as well. It needs to have the character controller component thing. It needs to have the player input, but those are in the prefab. But if you were to construct it on your own, those would need to be there as well. Um I've tried to solve that problem in most cases where I can. For instance, if you add a character controller script to something, it automatically adds this component. However, not every component is of the same category. And so things like player input can't be automatically added. There's always some sort of limitation to that kind of um situation. Uh, but all of the stuff that you care about is going to be in here. And yeah, we went over a lot of this last week.

So, um yeah, I'll bring my I meant to bring my controller today, but I did not. Uh I'll bring it on uh Wednesday. The good news is that I mean it's been the same I think for those of you who I've seen use the Xbox controller, but the PlayStation controller if you plug it in via USB, it does pretty much work out of the box, but um like you have it there and it's already moving the character around like that should that should be happening if you just plug it in, right?

So this whole thing uses what if you search for things online, this is Unity's new input system, meaning that you know, I don't know, it's like five years old. Um the because the other one was essentially the entire duration of Unity. And so the good news is is that's super powerful. The bad news is it's super powerful um in that it's also like pretty cryptic. Um, but when I think it's configured in a way that it should quote unquote just work. Um, and you don't have to deal with some of its idiosyncrasies. Um, but if you're looking things up online, the whole project, this is a projectwide decision you need to make. Like, does my project use, you know, the legacy input system or the new input system? And this is using the new input system. So be aware of that when you're looking at stuff online. Um, in the new input system, you're interacting through this through the player input component. And that's why it's the player input component is required on the character controller, which is here, right? Um, right here, player input. And let's not touch anything there right now. And um this is talking to an asset called the input system actions. And this is where you can configure new inputs and it's where you can Um it's the thing that sort of manages keyboard in our case mostly just keyboard or controller and so this is one of those instances where I think it's very clear or it should be clear that putting a layer of abstraction between the controller and what you're doing helps make it more flexible. You have this abstract action called we're going to set up um we'll set up dodge. Okay, so we have this abstract action called dodge. And when our character controller receives the dodge command, it does dodge stuff that's in the code already. Um, however, what do you how does that how does dodge get triggered? Well, if I'm on the keyboard, uh, the default is I think it's C. Um, and then if I'm on, uh, the controller, the default is east. Okay. So, for me, that's circle, right? I have PlayStation. Um the and so having something that manages that whole decision like are you on keyboard, are you on a controller and then both of those things. let's manage those and then route whatever it is to this abstract dodge and have that in the code rather than having the code dependent directly on I pressed C on the keyboard, right? Because then if you did that, if you quote unquote hardcoded this relationship between that keyboard key and the dodge functionality, that would work fine as long as you're on a keyboard. The minute that you want to expand the way to control the game, then you would need to put some sort of branching logic in the controller to say like, you know, he if you press this keyboard key on the keyboard or you press this button on the controller, what kind of controller are you on? Okay. Well, then I need to be well then it's going to be a different, right? You see how this just blows up in terms of complexity there. And so that while this does add some complexity to the system, it's appropriate and I don't think crazy and they did construct a fairly reasonable window here with which to manage this stuff. So that's what's going on here. the uh input system actions asset is what we're going to um configure so that it has a dodge action and then um that talks to all of this stuff. So if we come back here to Unity um up here uh or actually down here. So the in player input, the easiest way to get to it is it's already populated into this field.

Because you got the our data types come into play here, right? What type of data is coming from that controller, right? in terms of like when you press a button, a button is just a boolean, right? We we have long press and short press and stuff, but it's still just, you know, button not pressed zero, button pressed one. That's it, right? Um whereas a controller is not a zero or one. It ends up being a float, right? In terms of there's an x coordinate and there's a ycoordinate for wherever the joystick is at the current moment. And so, uh, those are the two ones we really care about here. And so, this is the whole thing that's managing this. Um, you know, we're just going to configure dodge. Do not mess with the existing stuff here. Like the the way it's set up right now, the this is more or less the default is good and um, let it let it be. But if we were to look here, um, if we were to add more actions, the Let's come over here and Um, so we can use this as a template here because it'll be similar. And that jump has this keyboard command and it has this button south command. And if we were to grab this and uh duplicate it. There we go. Now we have something to start with and we could uh configure this. And so I'm going to rename it capital D dodge. And then on the keyboard here, let's go ahead and uh send it to uh if you this is so this is like the input mapping. Um you this is where like the hard work has been done to make Unity actually receive information from all of these different kind of things. And so looking through these menus is crazy. Don't do it. What you can do here is just simply type um the key you want to use and then it goes to that part right there. And so now it's on the key keyboard. And then over here um we would change this to gamepad button east. And now we have a dodge in there. And so with that in place, um, yeah, it's already set up to do a lot of the other typical stuff.

And so now, as I'm moving around, if I press C, I get this burst of speed, my dodge. And these controls down here now work. Um, so the why didn't they work before? Because there was no dodge. And the there is a hard-coded thing here where this is looking for an action capital D dodge. Again, it's a variable name needs to be precisely that. Um, and so if I want to dodge or dodge faster, I can adjust these here and then my dodge will do more, a lot more in this case. There we go. Right. So, how long you're dodging and how far you're dodging. And then there is a cool down so you can't just jam dodge. Um, and then also an on and off for should you be can do you want the player to be able to dodge in the air or not. Uh, and so you can, you know, enable that or not enable that. Um, cool. Okay. So that's as you want to be doing in that input um actions, but it's important to understand what's going on there. And that it is an extra bit of complexity, but it does allow you to essentially plug in your game pad and have it just work um out of the box, which is not a trivial thing, right? If you had if all that was hardcoded, you'd have to go in and adjust all that, you know, manually or write some other management system to do all those things, which is much less the whole part of like actually getting the data into Unity from whatever thing that you've plugged into the computer, which is also, you know, not not trivial in a lot of instances. I've done a bunch of stuff with like, you know, like connect controllers and uh other depth camera things and like it that's always a very difficult situation to troubleshoot because it's very it's very opaque in terms of like is the data getting in here? you know, like it, you know, essentially you're just sending a bunch of debug messages and changing things and hoping to god they eventually the data shows up over here and then you can do something with it.

So that's as you want to be doing in that input um actions, but it's important to understand what's going on there. And that it is an extra bit of complexity, but it does allow you to essentially plug in your game pad and have it just work um out of the box, which is not a trivial thing, right? If you had if all that was hardcoded, you'd have to go in and adjust all that, you know, manually or write some other management system to do all those things, which is much less the whole part of like actually getting the data into Unity from whatever thing that you've plugged into the computer, which is also, you know, not not trivial in a lot of instances. I've done a bunch of stuff with like, you know, like connect controllers and uh other depth camera things and like it that's always a very difficult situation to troubleshoot because it's very it's very opaque in terms of like is the data getting in here? you know, like it, you know, essentially you're just sending a bunch of debug messages and changing things and hoping to god they eventually the data shows up over here and then you can do something with it. Uh, so cool. Okay, that's good. We've got that in place. [Music]"

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 03, 2025 Moving Platform Implementation One of the first things we're doing this week once we have our character in the new template is gray boxing our level in terms of like just starting to lay everything out in terms of like where do things need to be in space in Unity to get around, you know, if things are going up and down. Is my character's jump height going to be something that works with, you know, the amount of verticality and what I have here? And so part of that is like, is the game going to have moving platforms? And uh let's look at that situation. And so there's two components here to keep in mind with that. um is that in order to have the player quote unquote stick to the platform um there's a couple things to keep in mind. Moving platform is one. The platform collider needs to be tagged um moving platform. And then additionally there is a moving platform script, which will for a lot of typical moving platform situations. It'll make it easier to animate. However, it's not going to cover every conceivable moving platform motion. And if it doesn't, if you can't seem to do what whatever it is that you want with the moving platform, you can just use the standard animator. Uh, as long as it's tagged moving platform, you should be all right there. So, um, if you need different animation. So, let's look at setting that up over here. Uh, let's make this a bit smaller. And I'm going to save this one now. So, control drag here and then call this one Okay. And over here, uh, in addition to, let's just make the note of that. It needs to be tagged moving platform, but have the layer ground. Right? So there's just two ways. Remember layers here have nothing to do with like Photoshop layers. It's just another way of grouping or categorizing objects. And this is one this is a perfect example of why we have these two separate systems because there's plenty of instances where you would need and this is one of them two ways to categorize things, right? in terms of like this thing is moving and so it needs to activate all the moving platform functionality, but you also want your player to be able to jump on it and so it needs to be also identified as ground. And so we need to have both of those things. So let's do that here. Uh and so I'll grab this plane and just cr it. Um here or just control D it. There we go. And move it over about there. And uh let's put a material on it so I can tell what's happening. And then when I'm just sort of testing here in order to be able to see what I'm doing without getting Cinem Machine involved. Again, in order, I would recommend you using these tiny scenes to test out something you want to use so that you can control the variables. It's science, right? Like you want to really just be you you want to know that there's not a bunch of other factors influencing what you think you're doing, right? And in the main scene where you're building the big game, that's going to get complicated. There's going to be a bunch of stuff going on. And there's plenty of instances where things can conflict with each other. And so, especially if you're having trouble with something or if it's you like, I'm going to bring this element into my game, you know, make a tiny scene like this where I have a tiny scene template that you can use as a starting point to sort of like, okay, do I know how this can I make this work in this very, very limited environment? Okay, I understand how it works. Now I has now I stand a chance of getting it to work in the larger system. So, uh, let's do that. We're going to call this, we're just going to name it platform. Although that has nothing, no bare can be named Bob. It doesn't matter. That's not always the case. You can have uh Unity search for things based on the actual name, but I don't think any of this system does that off the top of my head. Um, and so we're going to put the moving platform tag on there. It's already on the ground layer because I just duplicated it from the other thing. Okay. And then over here uh under runtime uh let's look for platform. There it is. And so uh for the most part here, yeah, I tried to name things appropriately. Um and so when you look for different scripts, um a lot of times you'll see there's a script and then there's like the same script with the name editor. Do not use this one. Okay, that one needs to be there because and it is sequestered in a different folder labeled editor. But that in order to have more complex user interface in the editor, it makes sense to separate that stuff into a separate script. So they're still scripts and so they come up when you look for stuff. uh but don't they'll be activated automatically by using the actual script. And so um here uh we just want the platform animator on there. And uh if we were to let's look at this uh yeah so this one like I said you could animate every platform with the whole animation system but you you're starting to understand the cost benefit of the animation system for our main character. it makes a lot of sense, right? Because that whole state machine thing of switching between like that's not simple business. The complexity of the animator really shines there. But for like moving a block up and down, it's really like a lot of clicky overhead to get that done. And so I tried to create a couple things like this that do animation only in the script that make it a little bit simpler. And so this is a platform thing and it essentially animates between some points that you can add. And so it can go back and forth or to multiple things. And so if we hit plus here, it makes a new um object. And then in this object are the way points and you can then add to this. Right? So everyone is used to this user interface. um design pattern now where a lot of things when there's many many of the scripts are like this where I tried to make them as expandable as possible like how many way points do you want how many lines of dialogue are there um I tried to make it as many as you want and so that you can expand this by hitting the plus here and so here's way point one. Let's move that over here. Uh, and so now, yeah, in the editor, we see this moving from there to there. If we were to save and hit play, um, it should do its thing. Also, you're welcome. I made the default something that makes sense for um animation platform animation because 90% of student games start off with moving platforms that go like this and are impossible to jump on. Um and so the default is slow. But um now if I wanted to make this more complex, I could uh add another waypoint. Here's waypoint two. And move that one over here like this. And then um yeah, and it comes back. And so over here our settings are uh total time, right? And so if you add more way points to the existing thing, it ends up going faster. So yeah, at some point you just need to make a decision here where it's like do I have the amount of time per thing or do I have it a total amount of time is divided by the number of way points and so you know at some point you just need to make a call there. Although each when we have something like this where this quote unquote piece of data has two parts. There's a pause value and then there's the actual transform of where it is. Uh the name you want to learn here is this is a strruct just some sort of more complex piece of data constructed out of smaller pieces of data. Right? So like a float and a bool together would be a super simple strruct. This could explode into you know gigantic strructs of arbitrary s like entire spreadsheets full of stuff um could be a single strct you know format with which the other things are read. So here now if we have put a pause let's say let's pause for a second on each of these and then we were to animate now it does that I feel like this is clapw worthy [Applause] said fishing for compliments also going into third person which Casey does often when you continue go in third person talking about yourself in the third person does that become like sixth person or ninth person is there some sort of like exponential >> it becomes validate Hey, thank you. It's I'm fine. But um yeah, my hope is that this means that no longer will we ever have to see a student game where the platforms are going like this all the time uh in the first draft where the the feedback is like, I couldn't jump on any of your platforms because they they're they seem to be going way too fast. Um, yeah. And so the rest of the controls here, uh, I tried to be clear about, right? So, total animation time, easing curve, and so all of the animation scripts almost always have this in them, allowing you to get in here and do, you know, make your money. This is where you as animators do your thing is in the key frames. And you have the power of the scriptable animation, but then also the um fidelity of being able to uh control this here. And so for instance, say you wanted it to ease more. It's just a matter of you being able to manipulate this curve and knowing that in Unity you need to say free and that gives you a tangent handle. Nope, not free. Did I have it clicked? Both tangents, sorry, weighted. That gives you the tangent handle that you can drag. Free just keeps the tangent handle the same size. And so, right, both tangents weighted. And now if I wanted to really smoosh this scurve of easing to have it look very eased, I could do that. And if I know I'm going to reuse this S-curve, I can do um this and save it. And now within the entire project, if I need to come back and do this again, I can grab that same S scurve or whatever it is I did in here, right? Because why is this super applicable? What is the range um on the x axis? >> What is the range? That's right. What is the range on the y- axis? What is the name for for this range? Normalized. Right. And so this you would want to most of the time when you click on these animation curves in the editor, they want you to have a normalized curve here because wait, my thing, my animation is longer than one second. The script is handling that, right? And that math is easy, right? If we want the animation to be 3 seconds, we just take this stuff and we because it goes from zero to one, we just multiply it by three. And that then when you have this normalized stuff, makes it very very easy to map that on to any arbitrary range of stuff. So keep that in mind there. Um, good. And so now we looked at this. It would be very very slow startups. Okay. And let's make sure that we can get on this train. Um Oh, yeah. And so here I want to look at it from like here. I'm gonna grab the camera and with in these like tiny scenes where I'm not using the um cinem machine camera in order to again reduce the number of variables I'm dealing with. Uh if you want to change the camera position to this view, it is uh control shift f is the alt control alt0 of unity, right? Control alt0 being the move camera to view in blender. In Unity in the scene, it is control shift F. And so you need to be in the scene. Control shift F, but you need to have the camera selected and the mouse here. Then there you go. Now it's moved to here. And so you see that this moved over there. And so now I can see what I'm doing. And so I should be able to get on the platform and move on the platform and jump on the platform. Okay. And yeah, you need to be Yeah, in this case, this particular script has to generate more stuff over here. Why couldn't it just make these waypoints a child of this thing? because this thing is moving. And so if it moves, if the parent moves, the children move, then you're moving the waypoints, right? And you end up in this animation parent child moious strip of of movement. Um, and so you can't do that. Maybe it might be a good idea to then take both of these and say create empty parent and label this, you know, platform construct or some other obtuse name and then you can fold it up as one thing and then move it around to wherever you would want. Or if you wanted to re reuse this, you would Yeah, make it a prefab. Everybody else knew that, right? Yeah. Okay, good. Um, and we'd make it a prefab by doing that. And so now we have that. And now we have this. Why is it bigger? Oh, is it? Yes, it is. So, let's just zero it out over here. Reset. There we go. And so, now I can move this over here. And then I could see if I could uh Yeah. And so, in this case, they're going to stay synchronized. So, you wouldn't be able to do that without making that jump. And so if you wanted to do that, there's not a direct offset. What would be the simplest way to do such a thing? Maybe that. Yeah. and so now you're all free to make",

Um and then uh outputs here, right? So, when it completes the cycle, if you wanted to have some sort of sound play every time, right? That's where it would get connected to this, right? Like every time it gets back to the beginning, it could play a sound file of some kind. If you've got some sort of like elevator sound effect that you wanted to trigger each time, um, or every time it reaches a waypoint, right? If you wanted it to each time, um, that would be triggered from here. Don't let this intimidate you. I tried to make that say something else for as long as for we don't it's just an int is an int. Don't worry it's just a regular int for us. So just know that that's that's what's going on there. Um, oh yeah, and then for a lot of things that loop, we have loop or ping pong, right? So ping pong is I'll switch the second one here so we can see how that does. It's going to go, you know, like around and then back and then it'll be that pattern. So a bunch of the other animation type things loop like that. And so it's doing its thing. And then yeah, this shows up in the editor, too, which is outstanding in terms of the path. So being able to see this in the editor, I think, is super useful um for trying to plan these things out. Okay. And so let's save that. And again, the main things to keep in mind that on the platform, it's not going to work unless it has a collider. And it's also not going to work if that collider is a trigger because then you would just fall through it. Um, and then both of these things need to be the case for a moving platform is that you need to have the tag moving platform and the layer ground. And let's take a picture of that and put it on our muro. There we go. Cool. All right, that's in place. Let's look over here. Uh along the same lines there, if we look at our uh documentation, select the script here, F for looking at the documentation. It helps to go to 2D. It's really designed to be look viewed over here in the scene, which is why I'm just sort of shift spacebar over here to make this, you know, something to look around. Uh and so um along the same lines for the rest of your environment for things that move um again if it's going to be some sort of much more complex animation I want this thing to kind like jitter and then jump up and down and then tilt left right. That's clearly a job for the animator system so that you can key frame all that stuff for other things like I just want this sign spinning around stuff like that. Um action animate transform is going to do the job. And so if we look at this here, um there's a lot of options here for doing, you know, simple looping animations without the overhead of the uh animation system.

So being able to see this in the editor, I think, is super useful um for trying to plan these things out. Okay. And so let's save that. And again, the main things to keep in mind that on the platform, it's not going to work unless it has a collider. And it's also not going to work if that collider is a trigger because then you would just fall through it. Um, and then both of these things need to be the case for a moving platform is that you need to have the tag moving platform and the layer ground. And let's take a picture of that and put it on our muro. There we go. Cool. All right, that's in place. Let's look over here. Uh along the same lines there, if we look at our uh documentation, select the script here, F for looking at the documentation. It helps to go to 2D. It's really designed to be look viewed over here in the scene, which is why I'm just sort of shift spacebar over here to make this, you know, something to look around. Uh and so um along the same lines for the rest of your environment for things that move um again if it's going to be some sort of much more complex animation I want this thing to kind like jitter and then jump up and down and then tilt left right. That's clearly a job for the animator system so that you can key frame all that stuff for other things like I just want this sign spinning around stuff like that. Um action animate transform is going to do the job. And so if we look at this here, um there's a lot of options here for doing, you know, simple looping animations without the overhead of the uh animation system. And if we were to look at this here, come back over to here."

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 03, 2025 Transform Animation System Cool. Okay. So, other environmental animations. Let's come over here and make something simple. And I just want a slowly rotating cube or something that's going to form some other piece of the environment here. And so I've got my cube and I'm going to look for transform action animate transform. And a lot of the same stuff. Um if we were to set it up here by um default, let's look at what we're mapped to. If you hit plus uh actually let's just do the first one. And so this is another instance where it's a strruct. And so there's multiple um pieces of data that are part of this thing. And so in this case, let's go ahead and do the rotation Y. And then rotation Y, I'm going to make 60 so that it goes the whole way around. And uh then if we just hit play, we should see it doing something. And so it's just looping back and forth doing its thing here. Um, and so each element here is kind of like a track on one of the transform parameters. So this is limited to position, rotation, scale, and same kind of thing. Okay. So let's make this a slowly rotating cube instead of this which is not not something I would use. Um so over here uh which not Jack which of these is going to be the key to giving us a slowly rotating cube that continues to rotate indefinitely at the same speed like a sign on a gas station. Yes. Which one's that? >> Yeah. Which is which one? >> Yeah. This one right here. Right. And so we want that one which should be there by default in yours. Right. See it's just a line from 0 0 to one one. Uh and then it gets multiplied by all this business. And so the duration here um let's make it five seconds. And now if we hit play, it'll just be slowly rotating once every five seconds, which is super useful and easy to build stuff using this. For instance, I want to turn this into like an environmental element here uh of this rotating glow cubes or whatever it is I decide to do with these, right? Um, this right here, duration randomness, is essentially a slider that does the job of that animation speed script that works with the animator where I want to make sure I have variation, just slight variation between all of them. Uh, but I don't want to go to all of them and give them all slightly different values. Right here, I can do this. I can turn up the amount of randomness that there is. And then I can just um control D this. And now I'll know that each one should select a slightly different duration value based on um the value that I have there. And so now you can see I could start to build um really interesting environment that has some motion to it here with these with this kind of tool. A lot of the same uh controls here. Start delay loop delay. I tried to name these things where I don't need to teach you what they do like they should be. As long as you understand what ping pong means here, um, that I think is clear. Um, yeah, when something says read only here, this is more like a display for you. Like you don't directly manipulate this. This is just like to let you know that it thinks it's playing, you know. So where this would where this would be key is like you notice may have noticed that when I just the default for a new strct here I think if I hit plus it duplicates it. Is that right? Yeah it does. Okay. Um but the when I dialed up the default it was min zero max one which for scaling and for movement is almost always fairly visually obvious that like something is happening for rotation not really. That means it's turn it's going to animate one degree of rotation. And so there'd be plenty of instances if I didn't change that value before I hit play, it would be it would be doing something, but it wouldn't look like it's doing something because it's just animating back and forth between 0 degrees and one degree. And that's very minor, right? Um, and so keep that in mind like as soon as you enter the world of rotation, you have to remember what what the values are here that are going to actually look like something is happening. Um, and then same thing in order to chain this to other stuff. Um, we've got other uh events here. So, for instance, you know, let's say I wanted a burst of particles every time this thing turns around. And so let's go to effects, particle system, and I'll uh now I'm using my blender keys. Come over here and move this to where I want it. Maybe right there. And over here a little bit. And change this to a shape sphere. There we go. And then under emission, let's just not zero. Um, we want to emit particles. And we can do that from the menu. And so also these don't need to live that long. Just for the sake of demonstration. lifetime uh one or let's go random between two constants one and five. Okay. And so that's okay. Now I come back to let's say this top cube and every time it turns around I want a burst of particles. So on animation loop, I want to talk to this particle system. And in the particle system, I want to emit And so now I could save and hit play. So chaining together based on the events. I could have a sound effect. I'm also triggering the sound effect for the sake of um let's do that just for the sake of demonstration. And so uh I think a best practice here is going to put your sound effects on their own empty game object. You could put the audio source on the same component on the same go game object, but that um the reason I'm discouraging you from doing that is that then it wouldn't be clear what's going on when you just glance at the editor, right? Uh it would be hidden underneath here, right? And so that's a lot of what we're trying to overcome is like not having the current state of stuff um hidden from us in the system. And so uh let's label this sound and then add an audio source. And let's just grab an audio source of some kind. And that needs to go in there. Not play on awake. Do not loop. We just want it to sit here and wait for a play signal. And so back up here and we expand this again. And we look for the sound here. And then we go to audio source uh play. And let's test it. [Music] Yeah, that one has a bunch of stuff. I wish there was a way to just sort of clip things here because if we look at this because we can do that with the animation. Wonder if there's a package for that. There probably is. I'll look for that and see if it comes up. So, we could just sort of grab this part without having to go into um uh Audition, but you get the idea. And then, you know, I want to reuse this Amy. What do I do if I want to reuse this whole thing? The particles, the sound, these spinning cubes. I've got this whole setup here, these things and they, you know, it's like this. Now, this is going to be like a tree in my environment, you know, like a tree and that there'll be a bunch of these that sort of define the space. So, if I want to reuse this whole construct, multiple spinning cubes, particle system, sound effect, what do I do? I need to package it up as a yes prefab. And um before I would do that, I would want to you know package them as a make empty parent. And this will be spinning cube thing and um in here that gets dragged into there and then I can make all of the spinning cube things I want. It's much easier to drag them in when you're in perspective view. [Music] Yeah. So, each one is randomized, so it's slightly different. It's triggering samples that are the same distance apart, but they get triggered at slightly different times. Um, but then that would continue on in this looping pattern. And we've um sort of inadvertently created emergent behavior with these stacking this stuff on top of each other. I mean more or less unintentionally, but like the system is designed so that you can build stuff like that. Um yeah. Okay. So that that works.",

    "video_id": "4nnGLSXaFJw",
    "search_text": "AVC200 November 03, 2025 Camera Zone Switching Okay, there's some stuff. Okay, so here's some stuff. And we'll walk up to said stuff. And then we want to have a different camera view when we get to this stuff. And so let's set that up. Uh I'm going to create a new uh you know when I want to just have zones here to handle things. Um I'm going to go ahead and make a empty and then put a cube or sorry box uh collider on there and immediately trigger. And we're going to call this uh trigger zone. And I think it would make a lot of sense to then uh use the trigger zone script on here and you know as a way to handle stuff. Let's go ahead and instead of scaling it here, I don't know if this is too critical. I'm going to actually change the size of the box collider to maybe five five5 as a starting point so I can see it there more clearly. And and okay, so I just have a trigger zone. It's set to trigger. I've got all this set up. And I would put this in here as a prefab so it' be easy to access later on uh and use for stuff. And so if we look at this here from the top and bring this over this way and move it over here, maybe rotate it so it's more oriented along with this stuff. And perhaps this one needs to be a little bit bigger. So 20 and that's good. And I'm in that trigger zone. And let's walk over to that thing. And so the trigger zone script here gives us enter while we're in it. It'll send out uh an event and then when we exit, it'll send out a separate event. And so this sort of consolidates. I think we had two separate for these before. And so now it's just one. So a little bit simpler. The other thing to know is that um for our event system, it uh the system is designed that in really in no instance I can think of should you put yourself in a situation where you're sending an event every frame. That's bad. From both like a just handling it logically and then also from a performance standpoint. The events are not designed to be sent 60 times a second. They should be discreet times that happen. And so it does make it a little bit difficult for how what if we want to do something while we're in the zone, right? I would try to logically solve that problem by turning something on when I enter and turning it off when I leave. However, there may be some other uses. And so I did put on trigger stay, but it does not trigger every frame by default. It sends out at this rate. Okay, so it sends it like once a second. It'll keep sending out that event, which you know could be a lot, but like in terms of like the game programming, it's not it shouldn't, you know, debilitate the system unless you had a hundred of them or something. Um, and so and by default it's off so that you know even when you're in there and you're not send the event isn't hooked up it's not pinging it for no reason. Anyways, we're not going to use that right now. We're just going to use the enter and we'll go from there. But um yeah, and by default it's looking for player and player should be tagged player, right? pretty much the whole system hinges on on that. Okay. And so we got that now. And so let's say that we want to look at the player different when we're over in this area when we step over to here. Um and we want to manage our cameras. And so I'm going to create a new empty here. And I'll call this camera manager. And then reset it. This isn't going to be like a visual thing in the scene. Um, and if we look at this, this should be Yeah. Camera switcher. Okay. So here, let's we can accumulate cameras over here and and then access them via Unity events. So when I get over here, let's create a new camera. So, I'm just gonna I don't want to have this one be like a free look camera, just a stationary camera. And so, when I get to here, I kind of want to look at it from, you know, maybe I zoom out so that I'm looking at the scene here. And so, I'm going to come over to Cinem Machine and make a uh just, you know, regular vanilla Cinem Machine camera. And now I want to look at stuff maybe up here when I get to here. And so I'm just going to get my scene where I want it. Make sure I have cinem machine camera selected. And then control shift F to put it there. And so now I want to go over there. And then let's say um we've got a a setup here now. And so labeling things becomes important. This cinem machine camera zone one. You know, sure I call it zone one. over here. Let's get some other stuff so we can tell what's happening. Actually, let's just test this for now. And so, uh, our trigger zone talks to the camera manager. Camera manager is going to do the important job of making sure that we don't have more than one camera on at a time. And so we can put this over here. There we go. You grabbed the wrong one. Game camera manager. There we go. This is what we want. And so over here, we can drag in this one. Um, we need to list our cameras. So, let's start a list of our cameras here. And the nice thing about this is that you can label your cameras. And so, here's uh this one. And this is going to be zone one. Label it something that's easy to type. Uh, and then over here our free look is going to be this one. And so this one is going to be the player camera. And now we can access this via Unity event. Uh, the game camera manager. The managers should have manager in the name. And so over here uh, we need to talk to this. And so when we enter, we want to talk to the camera manager. And then over here under game camera manager, we have uh enable camera. And then it's up to you to correctly type the name of the camera. There's no no other way around it there. I tried to think of some other system. It was going to be way too complex. Um, you need to make sure it's not going to work unless you make sure that you're you're putting whatever you named it. There is what you need to tell it to turn on or turn off. And so I called it zone one. And so I'm going to actually not rely on my typing because we've all seen how good that is. And come back over here and say that we want to look for zone one. And then when we exit, we want to come back to um again talk to the uh camera manager and game camera manager. enable player camera. Is that what I called it? Yes. Let's just make sure that that's correct over here. and let's test it out. So, I hit I'm going to make sure this is off so that it can be managed. And now if I uh look over here, what's a problem? Camera player not found. Oh, default should be player camera. There we go. And there we go. I'm using it. And I'm gonna walk over here. And when I get in here, there we go. Now I'm in here, I'm doing a thing. And then I'm not doing that thing and leaving. And once I leave, I get my sweet, sweet Cinem machine interpolation from one camera to another. And if I walk back over here into the zone, there I am. I'm doing a thing and then I'm leaving and I'm back over here to this. Um, so a little bit of setup there. The pain points were Yeah, this is the default one. It should probably be your top one. And in most cases, you probably need this to match this. So I call this player. By default, this is set to player. And so you solve a lot of problems by instead of calling this player camera, just call it player because that'll be the default name over here. Whatever it is, they're just names. You just need to make sure that they match. Could be Bob. As long as this is Bob and this is Bob, then it would work. Um, and so there now we have, let's say we're we want to have multiple sections like that. I might package some things up here. And so for instance, there's the camera itself, there's the stuff, and then there's the trigger zone. I might grab all of those things and make a new parent. And this is going to be a, you know, interaction zone. And now it's a thing that I can um duplicate. And so I could shift D this whole thing. Control D. And then move it over here. And perhaps rotate the whole thing like so. And now just update some of my stuff. And so in this trigger zone here, um we don't want to go to uh we want to go to the camera, you know, first of all, we need to add the new camera here. And so yeah, give me one more camera. And this one is going to be called zone, you guessed it, two. And it needs to reference this camera, which I probably just want to keep straight with two. I don't even think I need to have these off. I think this script actually turns them all off when it starts up. Let me just confirm that. And so now over here, you I've changed the camera. I've given it its own distinct name. And then in the triggering, I can just sort of um adjust this. And so when we get here, uh we don't want to talk to zone, we don't want to enable zone one, we want to enable zone two. Again, being sure that I got it correct. And so there we go. I've got a whole system for that. And so let's save. And we should be able to then pretty easily manage this. Let's make sure that they turn off by default. And they do. And so now over here, come over here. And there we go. Switching you. We also there's going to be some debug messages here, right? And inside this one. I tried to let you know it's working. That's great. Okay, I just interacted over there. And so now, uh, let's get out of here. All that name switching on mine. Yeah, keep it simple. insert now. Let's walk over here. Look at this thing. Why don't we go to zone two? Trigger zone. This trigger zone. Enable camera zone two. Make sure it says zone two. It does say zone two. I just didn't drag the zone two camera into zone two. So, just a little greater attention to detail here. Should do me a good job. Excellent over here. Get back over here. And you know it's live. So if I come back to this at any point, it's all there. But this keeps you from having to worry about switching all of the as you you know it seems like a lot of setup for two cameras and yeah but once we have more than two cameras this becomes much simpler at that point um in that you don't need to worry about turning all the other ones off when that one's on. this manager will make sure we only have one on at a time. It's also sending you these really friendly messages down here to let you know that like things are doing what you think they're doing. And then even sent me that alert that said like, hey, this thing doesn't match this thing. And so making sure that you have distinct names and you have the right objects set there so you can switch between those things. And by having these names, it makes this whole array, you know, one of indeterminant size. you can just keep adding more and more and more cameras as you go on because you can only ever have one camera on at a time period. So, um yeah, and then yeah, leave this to player and mark that player and you'll not run into a bunch of the uh renaming issues I just did. And then if you want to have something happen when the camera shifts in terms of maybe uh something appearing around the player, probably something player based there. This is an event that it sends out like this is the only output here. Mostly the script is just about input in that you're changing the camera. But in case there's some, you know, I tried even in cases where I wasn't even sure like why would you use this I tried to make some kind of event output so that it is possible to put it in some sort of chain of logic if you want to. And so, yeah, once we have that uh and everything set up, you know, making more zones where the camera would change, you know, now if I if I like this, but I don't like particularly like where the camera is for this one here, I can uh select this camera. If I want to look through this camera, that's control F. Nope, that's just camera F. Nope. Look through the existing camera. Alt F. I don't use that one as much. I'm not sure. Let's look. Actually, it may not work. machine. Maybe there's not one for that. Oh, look. Anyways, if you wanted to change it, like I didn't like the view here. Selecting Zh camera zone 2 and let's say I wanted it to be more of a thing like this is a giant thing we want to communicate. its uh size and stature. And so we put the camera lower. We do something to the field of view uh to do that. And then maybe right about here. Have this selected. Control shift F. And now when I would walk over to that one, I would get this other camera view. It's selected. Control shift F. There we go. It's over here. It is good. That's changed. Zone two. Okay, that should update. Let's see. Am I walking towards the correct one? Yeah, this one over here. Yeah, I think the field of view that's the only problem with not looking through it is like the field of view is different. And so maybe figuring out where that was where you want it in game view. Just remember, make a dental note of this 20. And then come back here and make sure that this isn't it in the menu. This one Yeah, maybe it doesn't have that where it changes the scene view to that view at the time. Okay. But event based camera switching. So camera manager, different zones, different cameras. We're good. Does it make sense what's going on there? Right. So mo I I there could be other things that change the camera, but I imagine most of the time it's going to be the trigger zone in that you're, you know, when I'm in here, we want it to look at the side and then like we some of you did with the uh rooms in your game, it could, you know, switch between dynamic camera between multiple dynamic cameras, right? So if you have multiple freelook ones with different settings, you can uh switch between those. Or if you have static and freelook ones, you can go and then if you want to change the way it interpolates, that's all down here in our ease in ease out settings. Um if we didn't want it, if we wanted to take less time there. Okay, that's good. Let's keep going.",
    "transcript_segment": "Okay, there's some stuff. Okay, so here's some stuff. And we'll walk up to said stuff. And then we want to have a different camera view when we get to this stuff. And so let's set that up. Uh I'm going to create a new uh you know when I want to just have zones here to handle things. Um I'm going to go ahead and make a empty and then put a cube or sorry box uh collider on there and immediately trigger. And we're going to call this uh trigger zone. And I think it would make a lot of sense to then uh use the trigger zone script on here and you know as a way to handle stuff. Let's go ahead and instead of scaling it here, I don't know if this is too critical. I'm going to actually change the size of the box collider to maybe five five5 as a starting point so I can see it there more clearly. And and okay, so I just have a trigger zone. It's set to trigger. I've got all this set up. And I would put this in here as a prefab so it' be easy to access later on uh and use for stuff. And so if we look at this here from the top and bring this over this way and move it over here, maybe rotate it so it's more oriented along with this stuff. And perhaps this one needs to be a little bit bigger. So 20 and that's good. And I'm in that trigger zone. And let's walk over to that thing. And so the trigger zone script here gives us enter while we're in it. It'll send out uh an event and then when we exit, it'll send out a separate event. And so this sort of consolidates. I think we had two separate for these before. And so now it's just one. So a little bit simpler. The other thing to know is that um for our event system, it uh the system is designed that in really in no instance I can think of should you put yourself in a situation where you're sending an event every frame. That's bad. From both like a just handling it logically and then also from a performance standpoint. The events are not designed to be sent 60 times a second. They should be discreet times that happen. And so it does make it a little bit difficult for how what if we want to do something while we're in the zone, right? I would try to logically solve that problem by turning something on when I enter and turning it off when I leave. However, there may be some other uses. And so I did put on trigger stay, but it does not trigger every frame by default. It sends out at this rate. Okay, so it sends it like once a second. It'll keep sending out that event, which you know could be a lot, but like in terms of like the game programming, it's not it shouldn't, you know, debilitate the system unless you had a hundred of them or something. Um, and so and by default it's off so that you know even when you're in there and you're not send the event isn't hooked up it's not pinging it for no reason. Anyways, we're not going to use that right now. We're just going to use the enter and we'll go from there. But um yeah, and by default it's looking for player and player should be tagged player, right? pretty much the whole system hinges on on that. Okay. And so we got that now. And so let's say that we want to look at the player different when we're over in this area when we step over to here. Um and we want to manage our cameras. And so I'm going to create a new empty here. And I'll call this camera manager. And then reset it. This isn't going to be like a visual thing in the scene. Um, and if we look at this, this should be Yeah. Camera switcher. Okay. So here, let's we can accumulate cameras over here and and then access them via Unity events. So when I get over here, let's create a new camera. So, I'm just gonna I don't want to have this one be like a free look camera, just a stationary camera. And so, when I get to here, I kind of want to look at it from, you know, maybe I zoom out so that I'm looking at the scene here. And so, I'm going to come over to Cinem Machine and make a uh just, you know, regular vanilla Cinem Machine camera. And now I want to look at stuff maybe up here when I get to here. And so I'm just going to get my scene where I want it. Make sure I have cinem machine camera selected. And then control shift F to put it there. And so now I want to go over there. And then let's say um we've got a a setup here now. And so labeling things becomes important. This cinem machine camera zone one. You know, sure I call it zone one. over here. Let's get some other stuff so we can tell what's happening. Actually, let's just test this for now. And so, uh, our trigger zone talks to the camera manager. Camera manager is going to do the important job of making sure that we don't have more than one camera on at a time. And so we can put this over here. There we go. You grabbed the wrong one. Game camera manager. There we go. This is what we want. And so over here, we can drag in this one. Um, we need to list our cameras. So, let's start a list of our cameras here. And the nice thing about this is that you can label your cameras. And so, here's uh this one. And this is going to be zone one. Label it something that's easy to type. Uh, and then over here our free look is going to be this one. And so this one is going to be the player camera. And now we can access this via Unity event. Uh, the game camera manager. The managers should have manager in the name. And so over here uh, we need to talk to this. And so when we enter, we want to talk to the camera manager. And then over here under game camera manager, we have uh enable camera. And then it's up to you to correctly type the name of the camera. There's no no other way around it there. I tried to think of some other system. It was going to be way too complex. Um, you need to make sure it's not going to work unless you make sure that you're you're putting whatever you named it. There is what you need to tell it to turn on or turn off. And so I called it zone one. And so I'm going to actually not rely on my typing because we've all seen how good that is. And come back over here and say that we want to look for zone one. And then when we exit, we want to come back to um again talk to the uh camera manager and game camera manager. enable player camera. Is that what I called it? Yes. Let's just make sure that that's correct over here. and let's test it out. So, I hit I'm going to make sure this is off so that it can be managed. And now if I uh look over here, what's a problem? Camera player not found. Oh, default should be player camera. There we go. And there we go. I'm using it. And I'm gonna walk over here. And when I get in here, there we go. Now I'm in here, I'm doing a thing. And then I'm not doing that thing and leaving. And once I leave, I get my sweet, sweet Cinem machine interpolation from one camera to another. And if I walk back over here into the zone, there I am. I'm doing a thing and then I'm leaving and I'm back over here to this. Um, so a little bit of setup there. The pain points were Yeah, this is the default one. It should probably be your top one. And in most cases, you probably need this to match this. So I call this player. By default, this is set to player. And so you solve a lot of problems by instead of calling this player camera, just call it player because that'll be the default name over here. Whatever it is, they're just names. You just need to make sure that they match. Could be Bob. As long as this is Bob and this is Bob, then it would work. Um, and so there now we have, let's say we're we want to have multiple sections like that. I might package some things up here. And so for instance, there's the camera itself, there's the stuff, and then there's the trigger zone. I might grab all of those things and make a new parent. And this is going to be a, you know, interaction zone. And now it's a thing that I can um duplicate. And so I could shift D this whole thing. Control D. And then move it over here. And perhaps rotate the whole thing like so. And now just update some of my stuff. And so in this trigger zone here, um we don't want to go to uh we want to go to the camera, you know, first of all, we need to add the new camera here. And so yeah, give me one more camera. And this one is going to be called zone, you guessed it, two. And it needs to reference this camera, which I probably just want to keep straight with two. I don't even think I need to have these off. I think this script actually turns them all off when it starts up. Let me just confirm that. And so now over here, you I've changed the camera. I've given it its own distinct name. And then in the triggering, I can just sort of um adjust this. And so when we get here, uh we don't want to talk to zone, we don't want to enable zone one, we want to enable zone two. Again, being sure that I got it correct. And so there we go. I've got a whole system for that. And so let's save. And we should be able to then pretty easily manage this. Let's make sure that they turn off by default. And they do. And so now over here, come over here. And there we go. Switching you. We also there's going to be some debug messages here, right? And inside this one. I tried to let you know it's working. That's great. Okay, I just interacted over there. And so now, uh, let's get out of here. All that name switching on mine. Yeah, keep it simple. insert now. Let's walk over here. Look at this thing. Why don't we go to zone two? Trigger zone. This trigger zone. Enable camera zone two. Make sure it says zone two. It does say zone two. I just didn't drag the zone two camera into zone two. So, just a little greater attention to detail here. Should do me a good job. Excellent over here. Get back over here. And you know it's live. So if I come back to this at any point, it's all there. But this keeps you from having to worry about switching all of the as you you know it seems like a lot of setup for two cameras and yeah but once we have more than two cameras this becomes much simpler at that point um in that you don't need to worry about turning all the other ones off when that one's on. this manager will make sure we only have one on at a time.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 03, 2025 Environmental Animation Examples Uh, under example scenes, there's a couple existing things here. Actually, action animate is the one to look at. Let's open up that real quick. So, this is just some more stuff. Anytime we get pink like this, something with the materials. Let's go to edit graph rendering materials. There's usually a convert all materials there. Let's look. You just didn't have any material. There we go. Now we have materials. Uh so if we look at this, let's hit play once. Some other things you can do with the action animate script. So delayed start over here for these things. rotating um pulsing for powerups or collectibles. That's kind of thing that would be great for this. And then even this that's totally done with the action animate ping ponging back and forth between two uh parameters on the Y. So, if we look at that one real quick. Uh, yeah. And so, the position Y is the up and down. Position Z is the making it go back and forth like this. And so, uh, having it set to um, you know, ping pong here allows it to go back and forth between two positions here. And then again, these are always um, normalized. And so most of the time when that's the case, there's a second parameter which is going to essentially be a multiplier like how how how much of an influence do you want this normalized parameter normalized change to make? And so for instance, this is the position Z on this ball here. And so it rem you could do it as a multiplier, but um it's even more flexible to have a min and max, right? We can just change what do you want the zero to be? What do you want the max to be? And so if I make this um you know eight or something like that and then run this, you see it bounces back and forth much much further there. Right? We're talking about this ball right here. And if I were I think this is live or no I mean some of the parameters are not going to update in real time. You'd have to restart because they get loaded in at start and so you would need to stop and then um move this over here and then do it again. Right. So, all sorts of super cool environmental movement here could be done pretty pretty easily, especially because these parameters these animations only apply to these parameters. And so, you're free to move it around on the not Z position. And then that'll all work. Um, no, even if you moved it around on the Z, that's what this parameter is for, this offset. And so, for instance, if we did this with this ball and controll D and create another one, control D, move it up like this. Because this is set to offset, it should bounce from its starting position like so. And so, you would end up in a situation like this. where you see that they're bouncing. It's adding this information to the starting position. But that's configurable. You can make it absolute. What are the options here? Offset or Yeah, absolute. Great. meaning that they would all if I clicked absolutely for all of these they would snap back down to the same position because they'd be reading this as quote unquote world position on the Z. Um yeah, so explore that one. There's a bunch of stuff there to check out. Um yeah, a lot of things you can manage there. Let's look at Okay, making more stuff.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 03, 2025 Spawning System Setup And so we've got this. I'm going to make a new um empty. And we'll call this spawner. And then for the time being, I'm going to make it a child of trigger zone. And just so that we know where it is. And I'm gonna take trigger zone and make it visually obvious. So this material that's here, let's give it some sort of color, but make it transparent with our alpha. Nothing's going to happen because we don't have we have an opaque material. Change it to transparent. And then if we come over to our trigger zone and make a cube of some kind just so we can see what's happening. and the filter. There we go. And so we'll be able to see that uh in the scene view or in the game view rather. Okay. And so that's there. And then our spawner. Let's bring in over here and look for spawn. Um, we've got a few options here. Let's go with auto spawner. There we go. And so this is going to have a list of things to spawn. And we can spawn them at a specific rate. Uh, so for instance, let's make something that's going to work here and do something. So I'll make some spheres for now. And so we'll grab a sphere here. And I want it to move around on its own. So I'll give it its rigid body in there. And that's good. And let's make it a color or something. There we go. That works. And now let's make sure that this just falls down like it's supposed to. Mission accomplished. Okay. And let's come back to our spawner. And here's something we want to spawn. So, let's put this in here. And um we want to be able to talk to this. So, um, in the trigger zone here, when we enter, let's talk to the spawner. Why does it not like that? There we go. I don't know what it didn't like before. Um, auto spawner. And so we can um we we can enable this or disable it or turn it on or turn it off here. Um, and so in terms of enabling it or stopping it or stopping it, um, we can turn things on or off or set, uh, our times here if we wanted to like increase or decrease the rate at which things are happening. Um, and so let's just turn it on for now. So, and under spawner here, that's there. Let's make sure it's off and give it a shot. Let's put our camera somewhere where we can see what's happening. There we go. spawner is on. So, a lot of times you're spawning stuff that has, you know, in the physics system here. And so, there's some um weird quirks. By default, the physics system is like super super perfect. And so even here where we have these spheres, um the spheres are sort of exactly in the same place. And so when it spawns a new sphere on top of the old sphere, it's not until they reach some sort of critical mass like that that they stop stacking exactly on top of each other in this like totally impossible in the real world way that would happen. Um but let's make this a little bit more interesting, right? And so it's essentially doing it randomly. This is the max amount of time between spawns. This is the minimum amount of time between spawns. So we'll make it like 0.1 and 0.5. And then we'll see that this may be much more dramatic. There we go. And to solve this problem, we have this range which allows us to sort of randomize where they're going. And so if we just give this a little bit of variation. Now, if we hit play and walk over there, you get something that's much more obvious as far as what's happening here. And then if we wanted that to stop again in the trigger zone here, we would talk to the spawner uh on the exit. So trigger zone plus on the exit. Talk to the spawner and make sure that we turned it off. And so that should do it. Let's put the spawner somewhere that makes more sense for the project. So, you walk into this room and all of a sudden it starts spewing spheres on top of you. Or if you're really good at sports ball, maybe it's some sort of dream, right? Or you're like, \"Finally, lots of balls to do something with. Uh, and then when we walk out that stops, start, stop, start, stop.\" Okay. So now um a really important thing to understand here when we're going to start to dynamically make objects which will someone's going to everyone's going to use this use this to some extent right because this could be right now it's just spheres it could be uh enemies or particle effects or other parts platforms that come up any you know could add new things. So, um, important to realize a few things here. The most thing that may not be totally obvious here is that, um, want to spawn new things. What type of new thing do we want to spawn here? Will this be a game object or a prefab? the eternal question. Um, and if a if you if if spawning a game object, um, it doesn't work if the game object",
    "transcript_segment": "And so we've got this. I'm going to make a new um empty. And we'll call this spawner. And then for the time being, I'm going to make it a child of trigger zone. And just so that we know where it is. And I'm gonna take trigger zone and make it visually obvious. So this material that's here, let's give it some sort of color, but make it transparent with our alpha. Nothing's going to happen because we don't have we have an opaque material. Change it to transparent. And then if we come over to our trigger zone and make a cube of some kind just so we can see what's happening. and the filter. There we go. And so we'll be able to see that uh in the scene view or in the game view rather. Okay. And so that's there. And then our spawner. Let's bring in over here and look for spawn. Um, we've got a few options here. Let's go with auto spawner. There we go. And so this is going to have a list of things to spawn. And we can spawn them at a specific rate. Uh, so for instance, let's make something that's going to work here and do something. So I'll make some spheres for now. And so we'll grab a sphere here. And I want it to move around on its own. So I'll give it its rigid body in there. And that's good. And let's make it a color or something. There we go. That works. And now let's make sure that this just falls down like it's supposed to. Mission accomplished. Okay. And let's come back to our spawner. And here's something we want to spawn. So, let's put this in here. And um we want to be able to talk to this. So, um, in the trigger zone here, when we enter, let's talk to the spawner. Why does it not like that? There we go. I don't know what it didn't like before. Um, auto spawner. And so we can um we we can enable this or disable it or turn it on or turn it off here. Um, and so in terms of enabling it or stopping it or stopping it, um, we can turn things on or off or set, uh, our times here if we wanted to like increase or decrease the rate at which things are happening. Um, and so let's just turn it on for now. So, and under spawner here, that's there. Let's make sure it's off and give it a shot. Let's put our camera somewhere where we can see what's happening. There we go. spawner is on. So, a lot of times you're spawning stuff that has, you know, in the physics system here. And so, there's some um weird quirks. By default, the physics system is like super super perfect. And so even here where we have these spheres, um the spheres are sort of exactly in the same place. And so when it spawns a new sphere on top of the old sphere, it's not until they reach some sort of critical mass like that that they stop stacking exactly on top of each other in this like totally impossible in the real world way that would happen. Um but let's make this a little bit more interesting, right? And so it's essentially doing it randomly. This is the max amount of time between spawns. This is the minimum amount of time between spawns. So we'll make it like 0.1 and 0.5. And then we'll see that this may be much more dramatic. There we go. And to solve this problem, we have this range which allows us to sort of randomize where they're going. And so if we just give this a little bit of variation. Now, if we hit play and walk over there, you get something that's much more obvious as far as what's happening here. And then if we wanted that to stop again in the trigger zone here, we would talk to the spawner uh on the exit. So trigger zone plus on the exit. Talk to the spawner and make sure that we turned it off. And so that should do it. Let's put the spawner somewhere that makes more sense for the project. So, you walk into this room and all of a sudden it starts spewing spheres on top of you. Or if you're really good at sports ball, maybe it's some sort of dream, right? Or you're like, \"Finally, lots of balls to do something with. Uh, and then when we walk out that stops, start, stop, start, stop.\" Okay. So now um a really important thing to understand here when we're going to start to dynamically make objects which will someone's going to everyone's going to use this use this to some extent right because this could be right now it's just spheres it could be uh enemies or particle effects or other parts platforms that come up any you know could add new things.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 03, 2025 Prefab vs Game Object Spawning So this is an issue here. If the game object itself that you're using as the template to copy to spawn, if that goes away for any reason over the course of the game, then it doesn't work. Right? So, for instance, um if I were to start the game and then delete the first sphere and then go into here, nothing happens because the spawner is actually Let me deleted the spawner just to because I think it should throw an error. I delete the correct thing. There we go. We're going to delete the sphere. Now, I'll walk into here. Yeah. In error town, right? Um because it's trying to to spawn something that's not not available anymore. So, that's a problem. the this can be addressed by having the spawner reference a prefab. Um, and so in the spawner here, instead of dragging the sphere from here, we're going to drag the sphere from here. Right? because the game as it's running cannot delete a prefab a pre like the as the game runs you can't like delete stuff out of the project of the game that's not how it works um and so now if I address this in the spawner and I say here prefab sphere not game object sphere in fact I'll clear it so we can clearly see so none And then under here, in fact, it gives you that option where do you want to refer to things in the scene or do you want to refer to things in the in the project? And in our case, let's say project sphere. Now, if I start the game and delete the sphere game object and then walk into the area still works because it's referencing the prefab reference a prefab. tab to avoid this problem. Right? So, you want to drag from the assets to the spawn object field. However, that's not the end of the story. for simple objects, that's the end of the story, okay? Like if if you're just going to walk in and just stuff's going to start raining down and that stuff doesn't have any other functionality that's chained to other events, then then we've solved the problem. Reference the prefab. the problem becomes and I really tried to figure out a way around this but it's just the structure of the way Unity is set up is that um let's make a new prefab. We'll call it cube. There we go. And give it some other color. And let's say this cube does something else where it needs to talk to things. So for instance um it has an input trigger zone on it and it triggers something on some other game object other just for the sake of example right now. Okay. Um that's great. And so it would seem that we could solve this by prefabbing this cube. The problem is this is that when we instantiate the prefab here, the unity event is unconfigured. This uh configuration of events only persists in the game objects, not in the prefabs. It's kind of a bummer. I'm trying to consider some ways to sort of hack that, but for right now, it's a limitation. Um, so if this were the case, we wanted this cube to be able to do this other stuff it does after we've spawned it, then we would need to talk to this one, right? Because if we tell the spawner to spawn the prefab cube, it's spawning these. These don't have um rigid bodies on them, so they're just as isis. It's spawning the prefab cube, but every prefab cube doesn't have whatever functionality it is that we wanted it to do there. If we tell the spawner to spawn the game object cube, which is this one that has this configured. And we run it. Now these spawns are correctly configured. Okay, so it's just a trade-off. Uh you need to be aware of both of these situations. So um configured events on prefabs will not spawn. And so here the answer is to spawn a configured game object. And so it's a little bit of a limit. We can't use prefabs quite as ubiquitously as one would hope here with the event game system because of this limitation. And so there are some instances when we're using this system where you're going to want to duplicate things. Even if you make them a prefab, if you do configure stuff on them, you're going to want to duplicate them. This is why you may have noticed or not noticed when I was doing the camera example and I made zone two over here. I duplicated it. I didn't drag in the prefab because it had a bunch of configured event information the all of the stuff about the zone the the trigger zone talking to the camera switcher. And so if I could make that whole thing a prefab and then just drag it in. But on each prefab that I dug in, I would need to reconfigure those events. If I just duplicate it, the events get duplicated and then you need to adjust them anyway. So there's that. But that's one of the the underlying first principle to understand here is that this configured events on prefabs will not spawn into the scene. Does this make sense here? So most of the time definitely use the prefabs to save templates, but then if you need if it's configured and it's talking to a bunch of other stuff and you want the copies to also talk to that stuff, it makes sense to just duplicate it in the scene and then go from there, not keep dragging it in. If it's a simple thing like this, here's a tree prefab is great, right? Because the tree doesn't need to do anything. It's just it's just a tree that just sits there, right? Um but if your trees talk to you when you walk up to them because they have input trigger zones that trigger tree whispering, then then you would want to make a tree whisper prefab and then control D the tree whisper throughout the entire scene. Does it make sense? It's a pretty good idea. I think it would be kind of spooky if you walked up to all the trees and they started talking to you like this. That That's a freebie there. Someone Someone run with that. It's not going to work for your game. You're on a submarine. >> Yeah, I suppose it's pretty weird submarine at that point. I guess >> what's that? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Meline with her uh flowerhead person. Yeah. All the all the trees and the plants whisper to each other. They whisper like really passive aggressive stuff. >> Do you think she likes that hat?

So, there's some different terminology in here. when you're working with a much bigger group of people, this sort of discreet stepping from part to part to part to part um is probably more important and necessary when you're working on your own. It's been my experience and from what I've seen of a lot of the students where this process, you know, instead of being this nice progression in this direction ends up looking a lot more like this. um as you're working by yourself and it's you know easier slashnecessary to sort of step back and forth throughout different parts of the process. Um the other um you know sort of in between section here uh something like previs. This would be a this term is mostly used for things like um visual effects where something's going to be um totally created in some sort of like lowfi animation uh environment as a way to make sure you're shooting the right stuff if you're combining it with real world production. Um, so these are kind of loose terms, especially here, previs and animatic. There's a lot of things that would sort of show up in those different categories. But, um, for our music video here, uh, you know, we're not working with a script per se. A lot of the visual ideas are kind of starting over this part. Um, I think once we're done with the music video, we'll do something where we go directly from script down the whole way through for something that's more narrative. But given our um situation here where we're doing something that's not as um doesn't sort of have our step-by-step narrative progression in it and can be more tempor, you know, let's say temporally loose like a music video is. um be starting over here with the process and in addition to that um the techniques for doing even the first step of the process here the storyboard are sort of varied. And so when we look at this some different examples and then we look at some different strategies for actually implementing this stuff uh with the storyboard itself. Um let's just list off some options here. This could totally be analog in parenthesis pencil paper. I'm fine with any of these. Um, we could be drawing in grease pencil. We could uh pencil and paper into Blender for sequencing here. Um or we could be blocking rough uh in Blender, you know, sort of sketch in 3D. I'm okay with any of these techniques. I do a lot of this now. um just having starting to put I I can I feel comfortable just sort of sketching in the environment at this point where it's sort of like I have this space I want to set things up in space and you know roughly place the camera and do all that sort of stuff and so uh especially because you know for a variety of reasons some of them personally my fault things are happening at a you know let's say compressed time scale and so um you know doing something starting here um does move the process through a little bit quicker in some instances, right? It's not like all the stuff that you do here, you know, even ends up being the same Blender file or same Cinema 4D file, you know, like it's sort of like, okay, well, doing that allowed me to see exactly how this is going to work and or at least have a better idea how it's going to work. Now, let me burn it all down and do it properly so that I can uh set it all up. But it does give you this, you know, essentially functional storyboard, which is going to be, you know, what do we want out of each of our storyboard scenes here? We want to be able to talk about wrangle my stuff here. There we go. Stop doing that. Here we go. There we go. Like that. Uh we want to be able to talk about you know what is it going to be the framing um the uh what's the word I'm making here a production design the yeah set characters what's going to be in this shot and then additionally here um depending on what you're doing you know at least some sort of idea of what's going on with the camera. And if you're doing it in 3D, you can also have some sort of idea of what's going on with the lighting. Again, not getting too distracted by any of these in particular parts, but just being able to start to get an idea of what's going to be going on here. This is sort of what we want out of our storyboard process, right? And so this is what we want to get. This is some different approaches for achieving strategically you know planning this stuff out.

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 03, 2025 Jodorowsky's Dune Case Study The first one being so there's the dune. When was the first dune 804? Yeah. Okay. So, Dune Her uh Herbert's sci-fi epic. Um the first pass at this is in 1984. Um the David Lynch version with Sting U the musician in it, right? The guy was the lead singer of the police. Um and then uh after that take on it um what's Jodaroski's first name? Um Alejandra Jodaroski uh who's more much more fringe um figure is interested in making um a new version of this. He is well known for Alapo and then Holy Mountain. I've seen Holy Mountain the whole way through. These are much more uh mystical, surreal, provocative movies. um but wanted to produce uh a new version of Dune because you know like the 1984 version people have a lot of issues with the whole thing. So um this this kind of hap this this movie never happens first of all. So but it's notable from a standpoint of the storyboard is that um that's like as far as this movie ever got. but it turned into like one of the like a really really really um you know almost fully functional graphic novel as um just during the storyboard um process and so the uh there's a separate documentary called Jodki's Dune just about the making of this movie that was never made. Um, >> quote on there. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like that that's there's I mean, I suppose a lot of the quoteunquote well-known Hollywood screen writers have a sense for a much stronger sense for how long these things should be. But, you know, like there's every especially like sci-fi epics, I feel like most of them start off as some sort of quote unquote unfilmable script that would be, you know, some sort of much much longer thing. And maybe some of that stuff gets filmed now because now like you can just sort of skip movie and make it, you know, six six seasons of television. Um, you know, that works to varying degrees. But um the documentary itself, again, Jack, put this one on your list. Is a highly controversial character, and I am no way endorsing him or his views, um which are, you know, I find some of his views not only questionable, but also offensive. So, be aware that he does express those views in this movie. But the movie is interesting from the just the whole situation surrounding trying to get this made. He kind of also commits his son to being um Paul Latreus and like kind of like trains him as a martial artist for like the better part of a decade for this role that never happens. And so part of the movie is looking back at um having spent the good part of your you know young childhood training for something that you know ostensibly never happened like that. So they actually talked to him. But um yeah, the let me see here. There was at some point the whole thing was published as a book, but I don't think it's in um Yeah. So, one of the big things was bringing on, I believe, French storyboard and comic artist Mobius. I don't know, probably better sounding and cooler in French. Um, but I'm not I'm pretty sure that's like a you know, like pen name, but I'm not quite certain. But the better part of the quote unquote, you know, like the whole movie is pre the whole thing is pre-production because it never ends up getting produced. Um, but you know, the entire um movie gets exhaustively um storyboarded here. And so, um, I'm not exactly sure how much Jodaroski, I mean, just off the cuff, I don't believe a lot of his other works were, you know, prevised and storyboarded with the same high degree of intentionality, like bringing ha scoring this having this really really amazing French uh, storyboard and comic artist agree to do the whole thing was sort of like the main like primarily like the biggest success of the whole project because it never gets made as a movie. Um and I don't believe it's part of you know Jodaroski's ongoing process. If you watch Holy Mountain again that's also a super long four hours and like also like Yeah, it's long. Uh >> yeah, I mean it is funny. What did you say? >> Four hours a week. >> Right. Right. Right. Well, I mean, just thinking about describing the movie as like quote unquote, you know, like almost unwatchable at four hours versus like how much time you put into any game, especially like the time they expect people to put into like AAA games where, you know, like me personally, I wish I could I wish there was a time slider on the games so that, you know, like I'm an adult with a job. I would love the 20our version of this without all the fluff so I can experience the thing because I really don't need to like go find all the, you know, gem tokens for the butcher in, you know, medium town uh that takes up another 25 hours in the middle of the game. Like I'm just I just don't need it. But uh maybe that kind of thing will happen more in the future. But it seems to be a future a feature of games these days in that there's a lot of people, you know, me not included, who want to pay for games by the pound. They're like, man, this thing only had quote unquote 15 hours of content, you know, whereas like it's going to take me probably two months to get through 15 hours of content as opposed to, you know, the other part of it. But it's interesting here in the uh you know the movie becomes unwatchable at four hours but people will easily devote that much time to the game. So this is one way to go about it. This is we're trying to work out all of the possible get as much detail into the pre-production as possible in order to have a much much more solidified artistic vision once it comes time for production. This makes a lot of sense for real world production because you've got, you know, anywhere between five and a hundred people that you're trying to point in the same direction to make something. And so having some sort of document you can hand off as opposed to having everybody ask their boss what they should do is really really really useful. Um, but the case being there was no, you know, like there's pretty much no 100 person uh animation or real world production house in Phoenix. And a lot of the work that happens here is of much much much smaller scope. And a lot of the work that essentially you would be doing at the beginning of careers is also of much much smaller scope. And so work you know having some sort of plan for how to unless you're going to graduate and move to Los Angeles immediately. That's a tough tough call. Um then what kind of work happens locally? what kind of things can you do with much much smaller teams even the team of one um so yeah it's definitely worth the look into a creative process and the visualization of everything here I find this like especially I mean it's been a couple years since I've seen the documentary but then you know I've since watched all the new Dune stuff the Dennis Villain new stuff and if you haven't seen that that is also So, I mean, I think it's outstanding. He's an outstanding filmmaker, but um yeah, interesting to see someone able to complete their vision at that scale because essentially like Dune 1 and Dune 2 are just Dune, but they split it into two movies because it was probably, you know, unfilmable slash unscreenable having both of the movies, you know, like I don't know what the combined runtime is, but it's probably close to four hours. like they're both like pretty long movies, but that's like essentially everything that's within um I don't know the first chunk of story. I'm not exactly sure where the narrative breaks down across all the books. I think that's all in book one, but I'm not totally certain. Have you guys read through the entire because there's like Yeah, it's one of those ones that like the Herbert starts it and there's like six books but then other people have since trailed off and continued the whole thing.",

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 03, 2025 Cohen Brothers Storyboarding Process The other um notable filmmakers who work in this way are the Cohen brothers where they uh really really really um commit to storyboarding the entire uh the entire film before uh before going to before getting out of pre-production. And so there's a bunch of different interesting versions of this online. Um this one here, this is Blood Simple. And this is an interesting thing. I've seen this one before. This is an overlaid version of sort of the shots from the film and then they're as in retrospect here just sort of like overlaid what was storyboarded for each um scene along with some of the script direction uh for what's going on. And this this kind of thing is possible given their um process because they are known for going through and working uh working out the whole thing you know graphic novel style. But the other main difference here is that even though they're, you know, filmmakers who have probably very very few uh constraints on their vision, the end product is not just we brought the storyboard to life. There's still significant changes that are part of the process, right? And so the messiness when I draw the squiggly line at the beginning is not, you know, like I do it for lulls, but it is, you know, indicative of what happens. A lot of, you know, quote unquote Hollywood making of stuff will look at the process and try to present it as like this really great step-by-step process that proceeded in a very orderly fashion from one part to the next part. But, you know, you're making things creatively and it's always much much much much more um messy than that. So, in terms of technically setting up or what to put in our storyboards here, um the other main thing I would write down here is arrows. If we're going the pen and pencil route here, um, this is going to be incredibly important for uh not only direction of characters slashobjects, but also um, uh, camera movement, this all becomes super useful. And so in if you're doing this in this sort of two-dimensional style, imagining how things exist outside the frame is useful. I mean, this is just a matter of like I'm going to be setting up the scene here, but now we're going to be looking at this part of it uh in this uh in this sequence uh versus, you know, pulling the camera out here with this. And again on all of these this is really really detailed and yeah this one has gone around a bunch. So this is no control for men. So the >> Yeah. And I'm sort of hesitant about getting knocked down, but as long as we keep the sound out and I keep blabbing over the top of it, I think we'll be okay. Um, can we do There we go. Uh so here we get you know this this kind of animatic here if I had to guess almost 100% this is like you know post um post animatic where yeah we took someone took the storyboard and then after it and so you can do that process going forward and uh there's another really interesting one for Wall-E that does that but the uh yeah we're seeing sort of at this you know this is I would say storyboard plus right so storyboard now given some minimal animation with an animatic and then how it compares to what was actually there and then here you also have the um script for what's going on at that point I think this is the end of the film if I remember correctly it's been a while since I've seen this should be on your list as Well, Jack, as it you know, I expect as soon as we're done with the final in December, you'll be doing nothing but watching movies until school starts in the middle of January as your list expands.",
    "transcript_segment": "The other um notable filmmakers who work in this way are the Cohen brothers where they uh really really really um commit to storyboarding the entire uh the entire film before uh before going to before getting out of pre-production. And so there's a bunch of different interesting versions of this online. Um this one here, this is Blood Simple. And this is an interesting thing. I've seen this one before. This is an overlaid version of sort of the shots from the film and then they're as in retrospect here just sort of like overlaid what was storyboarded for each um scene along with some of the script direction uh for what's going on. And this this kind of thing is possible given their um process because they are known for going through and working uh working out the whole thing you know graphic novel style. But the other main difference here is that even though they're, you know, filmmakers who have probably very very few uh constraints on their vision, the end product is not just we brought the storyboard to life. There's still significant changes that are part of the process, right? And so the messiness when I draw the squiggly line at the beginning is not, you know, like I do it for lulls, but it is, you know, indicative of what happens. A lot of, you know, quote unquote Hollywood making of stuff will look at the process and try to present it as like this really great step-by-step process that proceeded in a very orderly fashion from one part to the next part. But, you know, you're making things creatively and it's always much much much much more um messy than that.

But storyboarding, getting some sort of very preliminary visualization happening, whether it's pencil, whether it's grease pencil, whether you sketch some stuff in Photoshop, whether you scribbled it in Procreate and then output all of it and then dumped it into After Effects, I don't care, right? Whatever Whatever you think in terms of selecting a process here, which one should you pick? whichever one seems like the least amount of technical overhead for you right now. So that you can really think about like what do I want to see at the end of the process here, right? Is it a little bit shorter of a process if you sort of sketch stuff in Blender with everything there? kind of like we said, but um you really want to be focusing on what is this going to look like and feel like, not what is it going to um you know because the there is no standard process besides like you know drawing the image on the paper but then in order to take it to the next level you've got to get it moving in time and so any of your time tools that you know those of you who have taken 184 with me or with Amanda certainly have the After Effects skills to be able to sequence it in After Effects as we've discussed before like you can sequence things in Blender but that's not without its you know I don't put that in the like I'm not going to be using it a whole bunch if I have to sequence a bunch of stills you know I'm definitely doing that in After Effects because it's just much much much faster at this point. Um, but we want to get our storyboard in time. And so the good news is is that your timeline is set. You've picked out part of a piece of a song and things need to progress along with that in time. And so we don't need to worry about the, you know, recording the audio, um, the speed at which the actors are recording their lines, all that kind of business right now because we're just doing this music video. We're just focused on the visuals progressing along with the timeline. Um, and you can see here, I mean, especially with the storyboard and the final thing happening at the same time, you know, when things lined up with a story board, when they don't line up with the story board. And then when you're talking about real world production here, again, somewhere between, you know, three and a 100 people show up on set or on a sound stage. And there's always the process of discovery. Right? When we tried to put the camera here, we couldn't because there was a wall. Actually, you know, I just walked over here and this looks great. And so now I'm going to come over, you know, let's let's shoot this over here and then put it together. And then additionally, there's the, you know, the proc the post-production of the editing all this together. And I've discussed this before, but it's really really important is that the tools that we use and the process is really inherited from real world movie production that's shifting. it has been shifting slightly over the you know over the last I don't know 50 60 years but um using that to inform but not being sort of slavishly devoted to the real world process because the tools now give you a flexibility that just simply wasn't there uh before but depending on the amount of resources you had like the comb brothers have plenty of flexibility if they want to shoot an extra shot here they and do that. And the good news is is that, you know, within Blender, you're the Cohen brothers. If you want to put an extra shot here, you can. When students do their productions for uh FMP 108 next door, that's not always the case where like, well, we just ran out of time or what, everyone's been up for 10 hours and we're going home. We're not going to shoot anything else. Whereas, you were not up against those kind of things. Um, Angie asks about what about Odyssey for Unreal? It's like responsive. Yeah, I mean for this previsisualization stage again I don't care. Everyone, this is a 200 level class. Everyone at this point knows how to sequence some kind of stuff on a timeline. And so whatever is going to allow you to not be worried about the checkboxes and the file formats and the channel alpha channel conversions and think about what what does the end what does the end thing need to look like? How does it need to move? How does it need to feel? That's what you really want to be thinking about here, right? Um, there's another, if I can remember correctly, if we can look at some of this All right. So, I'll link to this list. This one has a bunch of the ones I've seen before of all the Cohen Brothers um different uh movies there. again they've worked with the same storyboard artist for like many many many of their films um just because uh I remember several times them just talking about the speed at which this gentleman sort of can sort of sketch their ideas.

They go through the whole film doing this whole thing with the script. Um and part of the reason he's kept this job is that they continue to do this is that he does this very very very very fast. And so you know speed here although you know our project is not gigantic is something to consider just sort of you want to make the the process as frictionless as possible right so that you're not being overly concerned uh with um with trying to get things from point A to point B.

Do we want to have one storyboard frame per shot? >> Yeah, I would say this is the minimum. And in a lot of cases, especially if we're going to have a lot of uh, you know, camera movement or is something going to, you know, substantially change over the course of that shot? In which case this would warrant multiple storyboard frames where you know it's possible that especially given our workflow in our setup that you would have a longer sequence that maybe be that might be one you know continuous unbroken thing. Now you should not are there famous scenes entire films that are one shot unbroken. Yes. Don't do that. So, um, like one of my favorite movies, um, Birdman is essentially one I mean it's it's actually not, but they make it look like it's one continuous camera shot until the very very very end. Um, so the in that case that film is still storyboarded, but isn't um you're not you don't have the you know edit as the point at which to clearly create a new frame. So consider this. If you get, you know, if you go to storyboard your thing and you end up with three pictures, like okay, well then you're probably what is changing over the course there? You need to substantially plan that there. And so this is going to be our sort of guiding principle for this. But uh when this breaks down or there's more than one thing per shot, you know, break it into multiple um multiple separate storyboard frames. And so in our pen and pencil workflow here, uh let's go ahead and scan. My recommendation here would be scan. This can be take a picture of it with your phone.

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 03, 2025 After Effects Animatic Setup Okay, let's look here. A couple options for putting everything together animatic style in um After Effects. We want to have us on the timeline. Our big um shortcuts here, L and then LL show the waveform in After Effects. And so this is key. And in terms of sequencing things, you although it's kind of counterintuitive, you want to prioritize the visual alignment. So for some of you, depending on what piece of music you picked, it may be more or less easy to see the quoteunquote beats of the music in the waveform. It just depends on the music. Um, you should certainly be able to see like the general sections and the repeating in there. Uh, once you do this in After Effects, if you mouse over right here, um, you can actually drag this down so that you get more real estate and you can see like a much better uh, impression of the waveform that's happening there. Um, also for After Effects, uh, what is it? Control. Yeah. So, control drag will scrub audio scrub the timeline. Um, which may sound like just a bunch of nonsense, but can be useful when you're trying to figure out like what is what is this part here. And depending on how far you zoomed in, you can see a little bit better what's happening. Um yeah, so there's that part of it. If we were looking at this, we've got this sequenced out. Um you can fade this in and out in After Effects with the um levels. Real quick here, zero is the max. So don't go above zero. You would just to fade in it would be something like -60 to 0. And then to fade out it would be something like 0 to60. And that uh this would be fade in and this would be fade out in order to organize this. So for instance at the beginning here if I wanted to fade this in for now I would move forward you know maybe here set a key frame move back and then just put this After Effects will show you this here which is useful and so you'll see that [Music] the in sound in AE. Uh the big problem here is that even just doing the storyboard, the visuals, the rendering will take longer than the sound. And so After Effects compensates by slowing down the sound. And so you'll hear it actually lower in speed and pitch. That's not it doesn't mean that that's what it's going to sound like when you export. It just means that that's what it's doing to try and keep it in sync while it's playing back for you. So keep that in mind. Especially this will be clear when you're doing something here and the bar is not green, which means it's been not pre-rendered by After Effects and not cached. And so then it will be um uh red, right? If I were to make any changes here, like bring in some other images of some kind So here I would be when you drag in just any image here, right? So these would be your scanned in images or photos thereof. Um, once we have these in place and you drag them onto the stage, they end up filling up the entire timeline. So, however long it is that you've decided to use, you know, somewhere between 15 and 45 to 50 seconds. 50 seconds, right? That's our max. Totally. Totally not going to go beyond 50 seconds. >> 54. Okay. 54 seconds. Um, and so you need to trim these here. The square brackets. Uh, alt square is going to trim the beginning. And then alt, uh, this one is going to trim the end. And so, for instance, I want to have this car and then the other shot. And so, I've got the car here. And I want it to stop right about here. Alt have that layer selected. Alt square bracket. That cuts that off. And then this. The other thing here is that in order to line things up in After Effects, hold down shift while dragging um so that it uh will snap to the next thing. It's pretty useful. It snaps to either the key frames or the edit or whatever. And so you can hold that down and snap to there. And so we would see that shift at this point. And so in the animatic here, you can add some pretty simple stuff. Again, communicating what it is you want to have happen here. And so if this were to fade in in the opacity, you know, we could key frame that there. And then again, you only hit the stopwatch once for those of you new to After Effects. And then you just change the value and it automatically sets another key frame. And so this would fade in and then cut to that one. [Music] Pretty dramatic, abstract music video, right? >> It'll be crazy at the end when the icosphere gets in the car >> and drives away. And so here um you know now we're doing this theosphere shows up and um things get real and here uh now yeah I trim this one so it's here and here. Um, maybe there's some camera shaking going on here. And so, uh, if we want to start to layer things on top, either pre-MP this layer, if it's going to get it all complicated, if you want to add multiple things in the same scene, then I would do that here. So for instance uh if we come in here well let's add the motion here. And so in After Effects a good one here is wiggle. Wiggle is random motion. Uh so if you come over here to effects and look for wiggle position and then the speed and the amount [Music] the camera operator has had way too much caffeine. [Music] Okay. And let's look at a situation. What's that? >> National Day. >> Is that what this is for? >> I haven't even had a sandwich. So the main draw uh I believe we did",
    "transcript_segment": "Okay, let's look here. A couple options for putting everything together animatic style in um After Effects. We want to have us on the timeline. Our big um shortcuts here, L and then LL show the waveform in After Effects. And so this is key. And in terms of sequencing things, you although it's kind of counterintuitive, you want to prioritize the visual alignment. So for some of you, depending on what piece of music you picked, it may be more or less easy to see the quoteunquote beats of the music in the waveform. It just depends on the music. Um, you should certainly be able to see like the general sections and the repeating in there. Uh, once you do this in After Effects, if you mouse over right here, um, you can actually drag this down so that you get more real estate and you can see like a much better uh, impression of the waveform that's happening there. Um, also for After Effects, uh, what is it? Control. Yeah. So, control drag will scrub audio scrub the timeline. Um, which may sound like just a bunch of nonsense, but can be useful when you're trying to figure out like what is what is this part here. And depending on how far you zoomed in, you can see a little bit better what's happening. Um yeah, so there's that part of it. If we were looking at this, we've got this sequenced out. Um you can fade this in and out in After Effects with the um levels. Real quick here, zero is the max. So don't go above zero. You would just to fade in it would be something like -60 to 0. And then to fade out it would be something like 0 to60. And that uh this would be fade in and this would be fade out in order to organize this. So for instance at the beginning here if I wanted to fade this in for now I would move forward you know maybe here set a key frame move back and then just put this After Effects will show you this here which is useful and so you'll see that [Music] the in sound in AE. Uh the big problem here is that even just doing the storyboard, the visuals, the rendering will take longer than the sound. And so After Effects compensates by slowing down the sound. And so you'll hear it actually lower in speed and pitch. That's not it doesn't mean that that's what it's going to sound like when you export. It just means that that's what it's doing to try and keep it in sync while it's playing back for you. So keep that in mind. Especially this will be clear when you're doing something here and the bar is not green, which means it's been not pre-rendered by After Effects and not cached. And so then it will be um uh red, right? If I were to make any changes here, like bring in some other images of some kind So here I would be when you drag in just any image here, right? So these would be your scanned in images or photos thereof. Um, once we have these in place and you drag them onto the stage, they end up filling up the entire timeline. So, however long it is that you've decided to use, you know, somewhere between 15 and 45 to 50 seconds. 50 seconds, right? That's our max. Totally. Totally not going to go beyond 50 seconds. >> 54. Okay. 54 seconds. Um, and so you need to trim these here. The square brackets. Uh, alt square is going to trim the beginning. And then alt, uh, this one is going to trim the end. And so, for instance, I want to have this car and then the other shot. And so, I've got the car here. And I want it to stop right about here. Alt have that layer selected. Alt square bracket. That cuts that off. And then this. The other thing here is that in order to line things up in After Effects, hold down shift while dragging um so that it uh will snap to the next thing.

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 03, 2025 Multi-Layer Photoshop Integration this before, didn't we? Where we linked to the multi- layer output for Creta. Didn't we do that this semester? Was that in this class? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. >> What did we do that for? That was for >> all right. Right. And yeah, even rough here with a mouse. Let's see. So, um, yeah, all of that stuff. We got multi-layer output from Credo. We got multi-layer output from Procreate. A lot of people draw on both of those programs. Uh, or obviously here Photoshop. And so in Photoshop, you would even need to go multi. I mean, we want to make multiple layers, but let's say we're staging something. And just in terms of again, doesn't need to be crazy with our character design, just sort of roughing out what's happening. Here's somebody in the foreground. You know, there's something over there. They're worried about something like this. And so they're all here on layer one. And so this is character. Um, and then uh let's go ahead and make a new layer. And over here, putting this behind uh you know, this is a distant thing. And so over here, uh, let's go ahead and actually we'll just let's go ahead and This is going to be um background. Some sort of house here. some sort of window. It's a little bit off screen and over on just thinking about this. Um, then if we have another layer here, again, this one didn't have the transparency on. And so, this one will be the character. And, uh, just very quickly, there's somebody in the foreground here. Uh, one of the things I think works here is knowing that we're going to be placing and animating the characters to an extent, thinking about the action line of the character and not having all the characters be completely stiff boards. I'd like to start with that as a way to sort of like guide the body placement here and thinking about what's going to be going on with the character's body placement knowing that this is going to be end up being some sort of informed uh way to inform sort of the silhouette placement of the character. You know, other especially if there's going to be multiple characters, you know, does does this one have is this Abraham Lincoln? Yes, it is. He's pointing at his childhood homestead, which was an answer on Jeopardy that I can't remember. No. >> What's that? >> No, it wasn't named It wasn't named after him yet. That doesn't come till later. Unfortunately, he didn't live long enough to see a lot of that stuff happen. Um, so, uh, yeah, we've got this, uh, bringing this into After Effects. Um, let's save as. We can just go directly PSD. And so, this is uh, Lincoln shot three. And let's put it in here and leave it as a PSD. And then over here when we bring in this Lincoln shot, I believe After Effects should prompt us. Yeah. And so uh we you can bring it in as footage. That'll smush it all together or composition. And so composition should give us access to our individual layers. Okay. And so now it comes in over here as composition. I can bring this down to my timeline here like so. And there's my Lincoln shot. Again, it populates the entire timeline. It actually needs to come here after this gripping icosphere scene. And so here we'll trim this up like so to here. And then you know it's a pre-MP. And so we double click and we can go into this here. We don't see anything in the background. Um especially if you're going to sketch in white. You you're in in black. Then you can come in here and add a new solid of a lighter color and have that as your background so you can see what's going on. But the all multiple characters would come in separately here. So could we arrange this stuff in 3D and After Effects and then create an After Effects camera and move it? Yeah, you could. Um, but uh I think again we want to stay lean and mean here. And so, you know, we could just simply uh, you know, scale some of the background here and uh just add some uh position key frames to sort of communicate what's happening. And so there's that. In this case, for these kind of camera animations, it's fairly quick because After Effects is linear by default. And then for instance, Lincoln here um could be moving um more I just didn't zoom in far enough. Plus, plus+++. Should have been holding down shift there. Right. So, we can sort of fake parallax by doing this kind of thing. Just moving one at the one speed versus the other speed. If you, you know, know how to wrangle After Effects quasi 3D, sure, you could go ahead and do that and move the camera. It's not that much longer, but if you're not already hip to that, it definitely is a bit more of a slog. Um, and so then back here, you know, we have this happening in our scene there. Another uh common one is you know bringing this in. Uh so we edited the composition there. If you needed to reuse something like this, if I drag this down again here, like so, it will have the same animations and everything, and they're both linked to the same comp. So if I change one, it'll change the other. And so if you do want to do two separate things with the same Photoshop file, you need to um duplicate the comp, which is uh just control C controlV. There we go. And so that gives me the other one. And so this is two. I can prove that by coming in here and like if I put in a different uh color background under solid go below the other layers. Um now you see that that doesn't affect this one is white. This one is red there. And so the only confusing thing here is that it will be this longer sort of timeline. And so you kind of need to look where that happens and then alt trim and then go to here and alt trim. And then you can hold down shift and sequence it where you would need it to be there. And so in this one instead of uh moving these let's just um zoom in. And so again, we can just do some pretty simple uh scale stuff. So here and here. And I'll go ahead and scale. And then drag this up. If we click both of them, we should be able to yeah, essentially push in on that shot. And so then back here that would be happening on this um the shot. So a lot of the kind of stuff we would want to be doing in animatic here kind of covered by that. So again Photoshop pretty low friction in that you can just sort of sketch each thing, think about how much of it needs to be in a separate layer. Sometimes maybe none, right? And again, um, I'm not looking for you to create a graphic novel version of your music video, right? That's not the point of it. And just sort of think about what it is that we're going to be doing here. Make sense? And then in After Effects, just to be clear, um file uh or composition add to media encoder cube. That will sometimes open up media encoder and then you can uh export this as a YouTube setting MP4. Let's see. Did it send it over? No, that's an old thing. Give it a second. It takes a long time for the bits to get over to Media Encoder. There we go. Now they're here. And so come over here and search for YouTube and look for 1080p and then drag that over here. And then you can just hit decide where you want to render this to, which uh in this case is we'll just send it over to here. And this is animatic. And we'll do this.",

And actually this arrow, let's have this all come from up here, right? Music preview production. This is essentially our uh idea. And so here this needs this idea needs to get worked out. The especially because it's a music video, the timing needs to get worked out here. But in addition to that, um, we need to start zeroing in on what what this is going to look like. And in this case, it's a good idea to uh essentially uh test the look and um workflow for the final project. And the terms we're looking at here are the I want you to produce one style frame. And depending on what's going on when you actually, you know, try to get hired to do a job, um, sometimes they're going to want more of this, the style frames. Sometimes they're going to want more of this. Sometimes it could be doing some of both in order to get hired to do the thing. Ideally, you don't want to have situations where you're doing a bunch of work for the possibility of getting paid to do more work. Um, but that is the reality of doing this kind of stuff in different points. And so over here, we're not concerned about the timing. We're trying to create um something that's as close we want to create one frame that's as close to um what we think the final project is going to be. So, one frame very to the final look. Um, sometimes people would ask for multiple style frames, you know, like if there's different locations or different parts of the thing, something like that. Uh, so the job over here is fundamentally different. over here we're sacrificing visual quality in order to plan how is this thing going to unfold over time without doing this in the past a lot of student projects end up being like one really cool looking first scene and then like some junk that really get looks less and less good over the course of the entire thing because there hasn't been any plan as to like how this all will progress that sort of just start the project and they're like okay here's the blender scene for scene one or for shot one and then somehow 90% of the time gets spent on that one and then the remaining 5% of the time gets spent on the remaining 90% of the project. Right? So the storyboard and animatic process is a way to try to avoid that kind of situation. The style frame process here is trying to really nail down what do you think you know as close as you can to get one frame. And so because of that um there are no rules. Um, so all the like you're like, \"Okay, well this snow is going to be maybe it's going to snow and that's going to be like a particle effect in Blender and so maybe I should make a particle.\" No, no, no. Don't make a particle effect, right? Just simply try to comp some still frames of snow in over top. So here we could What's What are What's the workflow over here? You certainly could start with a blend like a blender render in EV or maybe even cycles because you just need one frame and if the light and the quality are really important for you then that may be important and then bringing that into you know this is again do we start in Blender? Do we even know how to spell Blender? No. Who knows? It could be anything at this point. >> Blender. Blender. Bender. >> A Vitamix. >> Is that what that's called? >> What? >> Oh. Oh. Oh. Like the Vitamix. The the actual blender. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have a really fancy Vitamix, so I like the Then you're going to need to do some more for most of you. I imagine there's going to be more to get the look and feel down here sort of comp level work. And so again, you can choose where that needs to happen. Could be Blender compositing, could be Photoshop, could be After Effects. Right? Again, whatever is going to be allow you to get closest to what you think the quality, the visual quality of the final thing should be. And so between these two things, I think by next Tuesday, we can have a really good you'll be able to communicate clearly what it is you're trying to make, right? Like it's it's going to look like this and unfold like that. Okay. So, there's",

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 03, 2025 Pacific Rim Title Sequence Analysis This is what ends up being some of the end sequence for uh the Pacific Rim, the first Pacific Rim movie. This was the sequence was done, the title sequence, end title sequence was done in Cinema 4D. This a lot of what we see here. um we get the this is you know kind of half breakdown half um animatic right so a lot of what we're seeing in terms of the gray rendering of these ver versions this would definitely be something that would be in the animatic territory here right we've got our things laid out in space we're able to get a really good sense of the camera movement and then some of what we see here is some of the comp and whatnot for the end and so getting to here Just one frame of this is what we would be looking at for individual style frames. And so we really want to get to one thing that is one frame that is close to what we want to see here at the end. Um, another good site to have bookmarked here in terms of process and then also just awesome stuff is Art of the Title. And so this is like a Patreonup supported website that um is documenting really really great uh title sequences. So in the past this class has done like a more expanded title sequence project and this year we're just going to do the more experience more expanded music video sequence. Um, but the title sequences are most of the time function very much as like music videos that are kind of in the vibe of whatever the particular show is. Um and a lot of times in these um there's not only sort of like making of but then also uh frames and then style frames from uh putting this together. So, where's the severance? So like the quality of animation in this one, I don't want to play the whole thing, but if we look at parts of it is, you know, a lot of it is these sort of isometric miniatures of the characters. Um, and a lot of the sort of surreal application of what is, you know, not super super high poly versions of, you know, the characters in it with a lot of like Miximoesque um animations applied. Um, I think it's a really good the, you know, sort of, uh, sequencing of the whole thing and what they're doing with the characters in the overall look and feel of it, I think, is, you know, not only super super well done, but also as you're looking at this now, I think it's something that looks, you can sort of understand what was being done here uh step by step by step. Some of the transitions are pretty, you know, probably a lot of After Effects work after the render is done, but uh a really good example to look at there. Let's see. Does anything come up? If I'm look for the actual this Oh, here we go. This is what I was looking for. Okay, so in the Pacific Rim art of the title story, right? So again, this is uh you give a flavor of what this ended up being at the end of the day. these sort of like really dramatic camera movement shots of the joggers, the giant robots um in this space like super stylized but uh there's a really great talk online that used to be online I should really start archiving everything that's a link to in canvas so I have it um where uh they talked at length so uh this was at the time the company was imaginary forces is That's still a studio. Yeah. Okay, good. That's confronting that that still exists. Um the uh other name I would write down here is Ryan Summers. So he has since moved on. He has he did have his own studio. the name is escaping me, but he's uh a fairly public personality around motion design and animation. And he at the time was working for um uh Imaginary Forces here, and they got hired to do this Pacific Rim uh job for the title sequence. uh and and so this uh is an example of uh some style frames when they're pitching GMO. This the first one was GMO de Toro um on the title sequences. And so these like sort of three different directions they could go here uh in terms of what this title sequence could look like. Um, and so again, this would be uh, you know, like more of this like anime action line sequence thing, more of this, you know, Japanese kanji in the background and some of this is uh, sort of vector drawing over top of these things or this. And they show all of this to give Toro. And I think they also had some um renders of some of the uh joggers in the 3D environment with just this dramatic lighting on it and he he really really really liked this. He kept saying that like this is this is what I want. He if I remember if I can't believe that it's not online. Really want to find it again. Even though like the software is outdated and everything, it's a really great story, personal rendition of going through this whole process with someone like that. He kept referring to these as sexy robots. And when I see the sexy robots, um, and the that's what ended up being. These are some of the um style frames that they presented then to move forward with the project. And so this is usually, you know, if the studio is either bringing in a subcontractor to do a job because, you know, a lot of studios are just more or less a creative director who then has a pool of subcontractors that they bring in depending on what the job is, right? Right? That's how a lot of these things work, especially now when like, you know, a lot of places don't even exist in real life in that they have a location at all. It's more of like this creative director has these connections and this identity and then they have this pool of people that they're working with. And so, um, at that point, a lot of it may be, you know, ask asking people to submit some style frames of like what would you do with this, right? How would you get close to this? The idea being that like obviously it's going to take a ton of time to animate a lot of these things, but could you show me one frame that's going to be close to what it's going to be what you think it would be at the end? Um, and here we see some cool storyboard frames for what, you know, as they planned out what shots they're going to see there. not sort of like pen and pencil sketch, but more of just sort of like very very very rough vector sketch in order to knowing that the whole thing was going to be dark and it was really gonna visually anchor on these lights that were in the robots. You know, they tried to represent it that way uh in this entire sequence. And so, um, yeah, I'll link to this article for sure, which has a lot of the same info that's in the talk, but the talk was also spectacular. And yeah, they had a lot of shots to get done here. And at the time, even rendering those shots in Cinema 4D, I mean, when's this movie come out? It's like 201 maybe before. I don't quite remember, but um they're working. I believe he said they did get versions of the models from um the visual effects company that was doing the actual robots in the movie, but that was about it, right? It wasn't that like they even got rig models, I don't believe, or anything like that. Um, this is this is not an animation uh animatic breakdown. This is just a breakdown of what's going on with this one shot where they're using this um essentially mask to drive uh this shader animation in the actual reveal of the title there at the very end. Uh and just sort of like what's happening in that final thing. But um yeah, now uh Ryan Summers has his own podcast that seems like it's kind of happening. He has a substack like everybody. Um, I thought the podcast was called Keys. I think it's the same as the Substack Keys and Curves as well. It's one of those things like he's been on a ton of other podcasts as well. But um somebody I pay attention to who you know works he's he comes like I don't know if he's very finicky or whatever but he seems to go to many companies and um also talks a lot about the state of the industry in various uh platforms. So important to pay attention to there. But here, yeah, we want to get one frame that's as close as we can to what the look and feel will be. Um, so that is going to depend on what the final process is here. What do you want the final look to be? How to like there's no requirements here. Everything that we've done is on the table, right? more of a two and a halfD thing with stage background, some sort of combination 2D, 3D thing, whatever it is, like how can you get close to that look and feel for just a single frame in terms of the color palette, the quality, the, you know, line quality, if it's going to be more of a two-dimensional or if elements of it are going to be two-dimensional, what it is. What is it that you want to do there? With this",

The mood board is not, you know, it being a static thing essentially just a big I would recommend using Miro for this or anything else if you have Pinterest if you're a Pinterest person. But um you know collection of references, things that you've seen that you think there's portions of these that speak directly to the look and feel of what it is you're going to be doing. Um, here I think it's okay to have multiple references here, but a lot of times it I see what happens if students put a a ton of stuff on their mood board. They collect a bunch of like stuff that looks great, but at some point you get too much stuff on there that it's hard to focus in on something and think about what what is what is the visual a visual trait of this reference that I'm going to try to extract and put in my work, right? And so because of that, I think um you know like two main references is useful where it's like I like this part of this you like their color palette or their lighting or the way the characters look and I'm going to combine it with the you know whatever it is the movement the kinetic uh typography of this thing and it's those two things I'm going to focus on combining here. Once you get beyond that, if you want to have some other things in the mood board, that's great. But, um, you know, I see a lot of mood boards where it's like a lot of really good-looking stuff, but then it's just not that helpful when it comes time to design because it's just unfocused. You don't know what it is that you're trying to focus on. Even if you just had one image where you're like, \"This iconic image is something that's like the whole vibe of this is something I want to stretch out over the entire timeline of my music video.

The mood board is not, you know, it being a static thing essentially just a big I would recommend using Miro for this or anything else if you have Pinterest if you're a Pinterest person. But um you know collection of references, things that you've seen that you think there's portions of these that speak directly to the look and feel of what it is you're going to be doing. Um, here I think it's okay to have multiple references here, but a lot of times it I see what happens if students put a a ton of stuff on their mood board. They collect a bunch of like stuff that looks great, but at some point you get too much stuff on there that it's hard to focus in on something and think about what what is what is the visual a visual trait of this reference that I'm going to try to extract and put in my work, right? And so because of that, I think um you know like two main references is useful where it's like I like this part of this you like their color palette or their lighting or the way the characters look and I'm going to combine it with the you know whatever it is the movement the kinetic uh typography of this thing and it's those two things I'm going to focus on combining here. Once you get beyond that, if you want to have some other things in the mood board, that's great. But, um, you know, I see a lot of mood boards where it's like a lot of really good-looking stuff, but then it's just not that helpful when it comes time to design because it's just unfocused. You don't know what it is that you're trying to focus on. Even if you just had one image where you're like, \"This iconic image is something that's like the whole vibe of this is something I want to stretch out over the entire timeline of my music video. What is it I want to do there?\" Okay. So, what what are the end"

So we have an idea of like how many shots are going to be in this, how long it's going to be. This will be a really good metric in terms of being able to give you some feedback in terms of like this seems like a crazy amount of work and undoable given our current amount of time or like yes, this seems like pretty good or it almost never happens but like there's nothing here. We need to put more stuff like what else could you do? Almost always it's the other thing with the student projects where it's like here's my plan to make Avatar 5 by next Thursday. Um and we have to >> what are we even on like which one's coming out? Four. Three. This is three. >> Three. Doesn't he have plan to make like 10 of them or something? I don't know. I mean like James Cameron's not getting younger. Like he's like he's an older man at this point. Um, but I'm sure he's probably uploaded himself to the Matrix and his, you know, AI, uh, similacrim will continue to produce Avatar movies in perpetuity after this. Um, so this again, whatever technique is going to give you the quickest output. So you can think about the timing and the progression of ideas over here. Again, whatever whatever it takes to get close to what it is that you want the final thing to look like. Not everything needs to be rendered. If you need, you know, we if you've taken 185, we do quotequote kit bashing there where we make some of our own parts and then we put them together into a bigger thing, right? The other the Photoshop equivalent is photo bashing where you would take out, you know, subtract different parts from different images to sort of put them together into a comprehensive render. Um, and so whichever 2D compositing setup you're more, you know, used to there, like I don't really touch Photoshop very often because I can just sort of like do it in a in After Effects and I'm way faster because I'm just I just use it way more. Um, and I just spit one frame out of After Effects, which isn't what it's designed for, but like it's just way faster for me. So, um, so yeah, we want a style frame and essentially what we're going to be calling our animatic, our moving storyboard for next week. Does this make sense? So, hopefully I can find some of those links that have been apparently subtracted, you know, just falling off of the internet at this point. And we'll look at some of those coming up. Questions? What do you think? Is it sort of clear? >> RI rigs that are styled similar in style like [Music] Okay. Rig has all of that built in. So any mesh that you just >> Yeah. Um there's also the ones from the Blender um foundation. So let me grab those and I can put those up for all of you guys because that those are not they're behind the Blender Foundation wall. But I'll put I'll make that we'll fi we'll find a way to make that available. So those it's a wide variety of characters with like different amounts of controls. Again I would discourage from having a bunch of things where you the character is lip syncing to the music, right? That's going to be a huge time sync when we want to be focusing on the cinematography of the thing. a lot of animation. >> Again, try try to focus on what we've actually been doing. >> Yeah. I mean, there's all sorts of ways to do it without that, right? I mean just you know music video you know immediately think like MTV people gy rating a lot but that doesn't have to be that kind of thing. Okay. Uh good. All right. So on you guys will be coming in with your ideas. You've got your lighting stuff coming together and we'll talk a little bit about moving the camera. Um, so these have some motion and then yeah, we can get to animatic and then some sort of um style frame and then move forward towards putting this together piece by piece and also addressing workflow concerns, right? because that's because it's pretty wide open creatively here what it is that you want to do. A lot of most of you will probably have different workflows from each other, right? So as this is the hard that this is the hardest part of doing this kind of work, right? I could make all the projects exactly like we're making this thing this time and everybody's making one of these, but I don't think that's really useful in terms of you guys figuring out what it is you like as an artist. And so making things more open-ended like this allows you to do that, which is ultimately more important. But it does make the being able to have everyone be on the same page and workflow much more challenging because now it should be clear to you having done this for a little while that like the part of motion graphics that is in animation that's the most difficult is like depending on what you want the end product to be the workflow can be radically radically different. Right? It's not like drawing a picture where like it's paper and it's pencil and you make a series of marks on the paper until it ends up as whatever it is that you wanted to draw, right? Like the technical strategy there is fairly clear at this point, right? I mean, there's other meta strategies to how you're making the marks on the t on the paper and that kind of stuff, but here it's like radically different like you're in a different program doing something else or you scanned a bunch of things or, you know, whatever it is. uh to get things uh based on what it is that you want to do, which is why we're doing the style frame now, right? Figuring out a lot of trying to get the style frame as close as possible helps us work backwards in terms of like what again break all the rules to make the style frame, whatever it is, to just get that push the pixels to what it is that you want it to look like. Right? If you if you want this character to be outlined, you don't need to wrangle grease pencil, you just need to go into Photoshop and draw an outline around the character, right? And then later we can figure out about like, well, how often is the character outlined or not outlined? Like, does it make sense to out, you know, render them from grease pencil or just comp them and then put do a 2D outline in the comp or or whatever it is. Uh, and so we can make those kind of decisions later at that point. >> Later meaning the Wednesday or the following Wednesday when we see all the style frames.

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 29, 2025 Student Feedback: Blender-Only Workflow everybody's work first. Hey, Thomas. Tommy. >> Okay. Hi. Um, I'm Thomas Camerazel and this is my spaceship scene. The reason the background looks different is because I'm at my grandpa's house taking care of their dog while they're away. Um, so here's my spaceship with it being textured and stuff. Once again, I don't have Substance Painter, so I just had to do all this in Blender. Yeah, great job for doing it in Blender. Uh yeah, let's see the when I saw this, you're definitely one of the ones where it came through and you know these tiny windows really uh tiny lights, this you kind of assume they're windows really sells the scale of this in terms of making it look like a giant freighter ship. And yeah, J Jack and I were talking. He watched the Industrial Light and Magic show. I mean, I think I mentioned it in this class. It was this class. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we've been talking about spaceships. Um, and if you have Disney Plus, it's just an absolutely great um, you know, education about the history of VFX. and uh you know by the end of the first season they're getting to what we're doing directly um in terms of using you know CG stuff in there but um there's a really great anecdote in there about uh them figuring out how big the lights should be on the Death Star for Luke's um final approach at the end of the movie. Spoiler alert for a movie that came out uh in 1977 and um that George Lucas's wife showed up on set and said that the scale was wrong and so they had to go back and remake all of the windows much much much smaller. For us, that's probably grabbing like a scale texture node and dragging the slider down. for them it was like a month of reconstructing all these tiny little reflectors in the entire thing. So, um, so yeah, uh, good. You did a nice job communicating the scale there. and yeah. So, by turning up the tiling on a lot of these things, these patterns, like you really makes it seem like a much much bigger thing, right? This is the counterintuitive or in some cases counterintuitive notion that like these small things make it look much much much bigger, right? Um, and it's way more uh it's way quicker to create this tiny tiny tiny detail in texture than it is in geometry, right? And not only is it way faster strategically, but then also technically in order to if all of those tiny little things were separate pieces of geometry, like then we were then we're in the in the world of like, you know, are we going to even be able to open this file, you know, because it's going to be so dense. Uh so yeah. And >> so the one the one that kind of gets away from it for me is this one over here, which is clearly like this like floor pattern kind of thing that looks, you know, gigantic compared to what you did over here. I I would recommend taking whatever this, you know, dark indents that there are in the red and maybe using that as a base for a smaller pattern that's existing over here, right? Um it's not it's not about using the most number of materials. Uh in fact, that probably works against you here, right? in that you wanted to make it seem like, you know, ships are, you know, built of similar materials and so you want to see things reused throughout the ship design. Hence the the >> this will be my scene. Do that. Okay. Uh this is my final scene. I couldn't uh render it. So I couldn't do anything in the compositing. I don't think I think you had to render it for that. So yeah, Tommy's computer situation is compromised. But what could you do? Well, if you wanted to stay in Blender and you can't render it, what would be another approach here? What's that? >> Yeah, I mean he that that's what he ended up doing. He ended up viewport rendering it. But then you can take your viewport render and then just drop that image into the compositing space and then you won't have you know you at least be able to apply the effects like bloom and stuff. you wouldn't have access to the cryptomat stuff and everything, but um yeah, you would at least be able to get uh that kind of stuff or render it and bring it into Photoshop and apply a glow in Photoshop and some layers of some other masks and stuff in there in in there. Right? So that's uh you know Photoshop the original compositing software. Uh, for my lighting, I tried to angle the sun in a way where it wouldn't have the ship cast a shadow on the planet because it just felt not very real when it did that. >> Yeah, the the ship is not going to cast a shadow on the planet, right? So, yeah, our lighting situation here is >> Yeah, we we'll we'll address some of those issues here. Uh, for my lighting, I tried to angle the sun in a way where it wouldn't have the ship cast a shadow on the planet because it just felt not very real when it did that because it shouldn't be able to cast a shadow on a planet like from this high up. Um, for the atmosphere it was just this. I would have done more with it, but I think I needed to do that in compositing again. >> Yeah. So, here the main thing that's that's not making this work is that the clouds are so far from the surface. And so I, you know, the depending on what your numbers are, like I would just scale this cloud sphere down closer, not exactly the same as the whatever you have the planet at, but just a tiny bit uh bigger so that you know they would be closer because having the cl as we discussed previously, having the clouds cast shadow onto the surf surface of the planet really helps give it the sense of like a real atmosphere and everything. So the distance here is too too much because it really just gives away the fact that the clouds are just a flat alpha pattern on a sphere, right? If if the atmosphere was this high, then we'd have to use a volume or something to sort of volutrically portray the clouds there. And then, you know, like you're already having problems rendering. You don't need to bring volumetric rendering into the equation.",
    "transcript_segment": "everybody's work first. Hey, Thomas. Tommy. >> Okay. Hi. Um, I'm Thomas Camerazel and this is my spaceship scene. The reason the background looks different is because I'm at my grandpa's house taking care of their dog while they're away. Um, so here's my spaceship with it being textured and stuff. Once again, I don't have Substance Painter, so I just had to do all this in Blender. Yeah, great job for doing it in Blender. Uh yeah, let's see the when I saw this, you're definitely one of the ones where it came through and you know these tiny windows really uh tiny lights, this you kind of assume they're windows really sells the scale of this in terms of making it look like a giant freighter ship. And yeah, J Jack and I were talking. He watched the Industrial Light and Magic show. I mean, I think I mentioned it in this class. It was this class. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we've been talking about spaceships. Um, and if you have Disney Plus, it's just an absolutely great um, you know, education about the history of VFX. and uh you know by the end of the first season they're getting to what we're doing directly um in terms of using you know CG stuff in there but um there's a really great anecdote in there about uh them figuring out how big the lights should be on the Death Star for Luke's um final approach at the end of the movie. Spoiler alert for a movie that came out uh in 1977 and um that George Lucas's wife showed up on set and said that the scale was wrong and so they had to go back and remake all of the windows much much much smaller. For us, that's probably grabbing like a scale texture node and dragging the slider down. for them it was like a month of reconstructing all these tiny little reflectors in the entire thing. So, um, so yeah, uh, good. You did a nice job communicating the scale there. and yeah. So, by turning up the tiling on a lot of these things, these patterns, like you really makes it seem like a much much bigger thing, right? This is the counterintuitive or in some cases counterintuitive notion that like these small things make it look much much much bigger, right? Um, and it's way more uh it's way quicker to create this tiny tiny tiny detail in texture than it is in geometry, right? And not only is it way faster strategically, but then also technically in order to if all of those tiny little things were separate pieces of geometry, like then we were then we're in the in the world of like, you know, are we going to even be able to open this file, you know, because it's going to be so dense. Uh so yeah. And >> so the one the one that kind of gets away from it for me is this one over here, which is clearly like this like floor pattern kind of thing that looks, you know, gigantic compared to what you did over here. I I would recommend taking whatever this, you know, dark indents that there are in the red and maybe using that as a base for a smaller pattern that's existing over here, right? Um it's not it's not about using the most number of materials. Uh in fact, that probably works against you here, right? in that you wanted to make it seem like, you know, ships are, you know, built of similar materials and so you want to see things reused throughout the ship design. Hence the the >> this will be my scene. Do that. Okay. Uh this is my final scene. I couldn't uh render it. So I couldn't do anything in the compositing. I don't think I think you had to render it for that. So yeah, Tommy's computer situation is compromised. But what could you do? Well, if you wanted to stay in Blender and you can't render it, what would be another approach here? What's that? >> Yeah, I mean he that that's what he ended up doing. He ended up viewport rendering it. But then you can take your viewport render and then just drop that image into the compositing space and then you won't have you know you at least be able to apply the effects like bloom and stuff. you wouldn't have access to the cryptomat stuff and everything, but um yeah, you would at least be able to get uh that kind of stuff or render it and bring it into Photoshop and apply a glow in Photoshop and some layers of some other masks and stuff in there in in there.

Uh, for my lighting, I tried to angle the sun in a way where it wouldn't have the ship cast a shadow on the planet because it just felt not very real when it did that. >> Yeah, the the ship is not going to cast a shadow on the planet, right? So, yeah, our lighting situation here is >> Yeah, we we'll we'll address some of those issues here. Uh, for my lighting, I tried to angle the sun in a way where it wouldn't have the ship cast a shadow on the planet because it just felt not very real when it did that because it shouldn't be able to cast a shadow on a planet like from this high up.

And then um everything else is just pointed uh painted normally. Uh the wing has some more stuff on it. So on my spaceship, um so the texture set I found here was magic space bus. Um I made the wings the opposite. So black over yellow versus the the bus is yellow over black. Um, and then for my Blender, this was the final Blender image. So, I added It's not working. There it goes. So, I did Earth. Um, and then I added my Magic Space Bus on here. Um, I added two things from the NASA site. So, I added the satellite and then the asteroid.

I tried to um get it to where it was here um where it was light and dark, but I couldn't get the right lighting or the way way I wanted to look at um my magic space bus.

So like uh yeah, I mean just to have it read as asteroid. I mean at this point how like what making an asteroid quote unquote from scratch shouldn't seem like a crazy feat, right?

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 29, 2025 Student Feedback: Reaver Pirate Ship >> Hey, good afternoon, class 185. This is Bo. How's everybody doing today? So, this is my Reaver spaceship that I modeled in Blender, and this is how I made her look in Substance Painter. So, I made a smart material. Uh it's following along in the videos, but this is the one that I made. It looks all like beat up and rusted. Uh, I like actually the way it came out. Um, so I just left it like that cuz it looks like it's been worn and like I said, it's like a pirate ship. Has all the guns and, you know, everything that's on there. So, I just kind of left it a little bit beat up. So, I made a glass visor for it for the cockpit. Uh, did change up some of the base materials to make it look like a little bit darker here, lighter around the edges. And then I made a vent because I did delete the other one. So I made this in the alpha channel, not alpha channel, but I made it with an alpha and then raised it and colored it in so it looks like the outline of event. >> Oh, and then following Casey's advice, I did cut um some booleans in there. So there's a curvature here now on the ship, and there's also this inset here. So I think it came out pretty good. I made uh some dust inclusion to kind of fill in those creases around the ship and then also put a little spaceship, you know, kind of, you know, just like the old fighter jets and bombers used to have back in the World War II. >> Yeah, that's a cool. >> Um for my antenna, I did create an anchor on these and then use the ship materials as that so it fill in and then made it a little bit darker. And then it's also where my lights are. And then on the lasers, I did use the ship material again, but added a copper bleach on top of that to give it a little more color and have it stand out a little bit more to where it's like worn, but it's not as worn as everything else. Not as worn as the rest of the ship. You got to take care of your guns. You want to stay alive. Um, so yeah, that's what I did in Substance Painter. Not not a lot of crazy crazy stuff, you know, not a lot of, you know, pretty sure everybody else did way more than that, but still, you know, still learning, getting in there, but I like I think I like the way this came out. And then for my blend file, this is the river in orbit around the planet I made. So, I made like a little marsh lens. Um, I have a couple different lightings in here. Turn off the lighting is really dark. You get the green glow from the nebula I made, which is I thought was pretty cool to see. Um, but that's with one sun lights up the planet and not too much of the ship. It does let the light stand out a little bit more, but I added another sun to kind of give some more depth on the ship so you can see a little bit better. And I kind of threw a moon over here. And then um, so this is what it looks like before the compositing. And this is what it looks like with the emissions on the compositing. Um, so if we move that out of the way. So yeah, I don't think it turned out too bad. You got a little glow from the atmosphere. Um, the clouds, the moon is a little bit brighter. Oh, and so what I did for the atmosphere is it's kind of hard because if you look in this room, I'm pretty sure my graphics card's on the way out, but it's just dots. Um, so it took me a while going back and forth from compositing to actually doing the, you know, shading on the planet and atmosphere. Going back to compositing, going back to shading, cuz you can see here there is a lot of actual, you know, depth to the clouds. They're not just dots, but when you come back to uh the shading, they are just dots. you know, it's it's really hard to see, you know, it's just Yeah. And my computer did crash a lot doing this project. Um, like I said, it's it's >> Okay, so Tommy just was able to render if he uninstalled render kit. So, at this point, let's all uninstall render kit. I'll see if there's some other add-on that automatically saves the renders. Certainly, there must be. Um, yeah. What's going on there? like your the rendering on the shader view is different. I didn't think there was a resolution on the view. Yeah, I'm not quite sure there. Yeah, the the planet looks really cool. Yeah, we'll look at getting some more light on our It's probably on this last legs, but we're almost through the semester. Um, but yeah, that's pretty much it. See? Yeah, the technical challenges would be that texturing. Not too much with the texturing of the planet. I mean, we went over that pretty extensively uh when we made our planet. So, I I liked I thought it was really cool, you know, getting back to where we had this before. Um, and that's, you know, how big the world is compared to my spaceship and the moon I didn't put too far away. No, that could be a little bit brighter. Um, but yeah, other than that, I enjoyed it. Um, let me know if there's anything else that I could have done, should do better, you know, for my portfolio. So, appreciate it. Thanks, guys. >> Yeah, we just want to be able to see more of the work we put in here. So, we'll do a couple of things to this, but let's let's look at everybody's stuff here first. Uh, who else are we missing here?",
    "transcript_segment": ">> Hey, good afternoon, class 185. This is Bo. How's everybody doing today? So, this is my Reaver spaceship that I modeled in Blender, and this is how I made her look in Substance Painter. So, I made a smart material. Uh it's following along in the videos, but this is the one that I made. It looks all like beat up and rusted. Uh, I like actually the way it came out. Um, so I just left it like that cuz it looks like it's been worn and like I said, it's like a pirate ship. Has all the guns and, you know, everything that's on there. So, I just kind of left it a little bit beat up. So, I made a glass visor for it for the cockpit. Uh, did change up some of the base materials to make it look like a little bit darker here, lighter around the edges. And then I made a vent because I did delete the other one. So I made this in the alpha channel, not alpha channel, but I made it with an alpha and then raised it and colored it in so it looks like the outline of event. >> Oh, and then following Casey's advice, I did cut um some booleans in there. So there's a curvature here now on the ship, and there's also this inset here. So I think it came out pretty good. I made uh some dust inclusion to kind of fill in those creases around the ship and then also put a little spaceship, you know, kind of, you know, just like the old fighter jets and bombers used to have back in the World War II. >> Yeah, that's a cool. >> Um for my antenna, I did create an anchor on these and then use the ship materials as that so it fill in and then made it a little bit darker. And then it's also where my lights are. And then on the lasers, I did use the ship material again, but added a copper bleach on top of that to give it a little more color and have it stand out a little bit more to where it's like worn, but it's not as worn as everything else. Not as worn as the rest of the ship. You got to take care of your guns. You want to stay alive. Um, so yeah, that's what I did in Substance Painter. Not not a lot of crazy crazy stuff, you know, not a lot of, you know, pretty sure everybody else did way more than that, but still, you know, still learning, getting in there, but I like I think I like the way this came out. And then for my blend file, this is the river in orbit around the planet I made. So, I made like a little marsh lens. Um, I have a couple different lightings in here. Turn off the lighting is really dark. You get the green glow from the nebula I made, which is I thought was pretty cool to see. Um, but that's with one sun lights up the planet and not too much of the ship. It does let the light stand out a little bit more, but I added another sun to kind of give some more depth on the ship so you can see a little bit better. And I kind of threw a moon over here. And then um, so this is what it looks like before the compositing. And this is what it looks like with the emissions on the compositing. Um, so if we move that out of the way. So yeah, I don't think it turned out too bad. You got a little glow from the atmosphere. Um, the clouds, the moon is a little bit brighter. Oh, and so what I did for the atmosphere is it's kind of hard because if you look in this room, I'm pretty sure my graphics card's on the way out, but it's just dots. Um, so it took me a while going back and forth from compositing to actually doing the, you know, shading on the planet and atmosphere. Going back to compositing, going back to shading, cuz you can see here there is a lot of actual, you know, depth to the clouds. They're not just dots, but when you come back to uh the shading, they are just dots. you know, it's it's really hard to see, you know, it's just Yeah. And my computer did crash a lot doing this project. Um, like I said, it's it's >> Okay, so Tommy just was able to render if he uninstalled render kit. So, at this point, let's all uninstall render kit. I'll see if there's some other add-on that automatically saves the renders. Certainly, there must be. Um, yeah. What's going on there? like your the rendering on the shader view is different. I didn't think there was a resolution on the view. Yeah, I'm not quite sure there. Yeah, the the planet looks really cool. Yeah, we'll look at getting some more light on our It's probably on this last legs, but we're almost through the semester. Um, but yeah, that's pretty much it. See? Yeah, the technical challenges would be that texturing. Not too much with the texturing of the planet. I mean, we went over that pretty extensively uh when we made our planet.

Um, uh, it was fairly simple. Uh, or at least it was a lot more straightforward to work with than it was previously. Uh, I had a lot of fun with it. Um, the general workflow was a lot simpler than it was previously and uh, I'm happy to have added a lot more texture than I would have done initially. Uh, so first things first, given uh, that this ship is fairly simple, I wanted to add a panel texture throughout just to give it some variation. Um, so there there's that. Uh, and then there was the actual decals that were added. Uh, I do kind of regret not adding the um having them interact with the uh the paint uh like the paint chipping the the paint chipping. Um, I definitely could uh utilizing some anchors, but it's so like jumbled up right now. Uh, it's not my best work in terms of organization, but there are there is use of anchor points. Um, I used it with the um the visor here. Um, let me see if I can get an example. >> Yeah. Uh, I used the visor mask in order to have it interact with uh the height maps and stuff. >> Cool. >> Um, and gener >> so Oh yeah, this with bows too as well. T O. Um, yeah, the looks like a bunch of people grabbed the blue glass preset or whatever to use for their this part. And that's fine. I mean, to my eyes, it just looks too, you know, like this color doesn't make sense with like the rest of this very controlled um design that you put together. And then both of them, yours and Bose, this looks way too clean um compared to the rest of the ship. And so wherever that Yeah. glass visor needs to have another fill layer on top that is just, you know, roughness with uh some with one of the grunge patterns in order to just, you know, put some something on there to make it look especially Bo, especially yours, like the rest of the ship like it's pretty worn and then that part really looks like anomalous anomalously clean compared to the rest of it. And this is also suffering a little bit from that. Andreal challenges. I would have worked with um the displacement a lot more, but I ran into a small issue, which was the low uh the the low poly count that was inherently a part of my ship. Had some problems. If I can show them off. Uh just gonna test it out. Oh, never mind. Uh, forget what I said. Uh, there were issues, some some major issues with um the uh displacement. Uh, now I'm going to have to fix that. Yeah, it's fine. Um, but yeah. Yeah, both. So that doesn't look out of place with the rest of the ship. Exactly. You want the glass just to be a little worn out. So yeah, using the displacement like that on this kind of thing in that way over the entire ship, you know, probably um yeah, I'm not sure if that's, you know, really a solid because remember this here, this is not you get an exp displacement map exported, but then the the displacement map that it makes doesn't include this which is the important part of displacement the subdivisions right in order to displace stuff it needs to be subdivided. Now the subdividing that's happening when you do displacement displacement is usually you know sort of a different category than the kind of uh subdivision that happens when you just add a subdivision surface. I mean, it's still subdividing, but it's technically happening on the GPU or something, so it's faster, but um yeah, you still need to ask your final render environment to do that, which is why this is not a thing that's happening in games, right? Uh because that would be a lot. Uh so yeah, you may not have noticed that it was displacing before because perhaps the subdivision count was way down, right? Or if you turn the scale of the displacement up with this the whole way down, every model is going to look like garbage because it's just displacing the existing. There won't be any detail in the displacement. Uh there were some major like uh there were gaps as you can see here. There were gaps whenever I would mess with uh the displacement of the ship parts. So I didn't really touch on that too much as much as I'd like to. Um I did add a lot of decals here. And I also had a lot of fun with adding a honeycomb pattern into the underside of the ship to make it >> more interesting. Um but yeah, so there is my full ship. Uh some issues uh will weren't really in the ship itself but more so uh in the render which I will show now. the tape and now there's no audio. So, you're telling us something about the ship. The Fresnel on the planet feels really big in terms of this amount of space here. If we look at a lot of images, it's really more of a thing that's much closer to the edge of the planet. Yeah, Andre, we just can't hear you. So, yeah, you've got bloom on. If you're telling me that you're not seeing the bloom here in the render, it's because you're didn't connect this here, right? this and this. The reason why in Blender 5 there's like a bundle group thing and then it goes to both the viewer and the output is that almost all the time you want to go to both the viewer and the output. And so if you're not seeing the uh bloom in the render, that's part of it. That's I mean that's completely why if this is the setup yeah I don't know Andre give us uh the gist on a Discord post in terms of what you are getting at here because yeah, there's no audio so we can't quite tell what you're showing us. I mean, I can definitely tell that you won't see any bloom in the output because you don't have it hooked in. You don't have the output of the bloom routed into here. But the ship looks cool.

So, yeah, here's my fully painted ship. Uh I'm really happy with how it turned out. I loved um messing with the panel, this like panel stuff here. Um, and just like combining this um, just combining all the materials together. I thought it was super fun. It was super cool. Um, yeah. So, I've got this text decals stuff, which is just uh, this right there. The normal decals, just a bunch of panels I put around the place. Yeah, all these yellow decals. Uh, I painted these with stencils uh, because I thought it really helped um, you know, kind of create that worn look. I added lights everywhere. I got lights here on the back. Got a bunch of stuff on the back here, too. The main thing that I used was this like kind of custom smart material, I guess, that I kind of made, which was like this olive green uh spaceship metal. So, it's like this metal but without the panels. This this like green metal. Um I made a combination of like yeah, like this charcoal buildup that's on it. Um a nice dirt layer as well. and then the base metal. Um, and I use that for most of these other things. So, like the gribbles, all have like that same metal. I think one of my biggest struggles was uh I really wanted to um procedurally add like bolts running along all of the panels and I was having a really hard time trying to make that work procedurally. Really trying to learn how anchor points work more. Uh because I think I still don't really understand fully how they work. But after yesterday, I think I kind of understand them a bit more. But yeah, I was trying to like use the anchor point on use the fill layer as like a mask, do like the mask outline and then somehow turn that into bolts, but I I couldn't figure it out. But yeah, so um yeah, I don't know like a good way to like make procedural bolts running along. That'd be really nice to also add to this. But uh and yeah, as far as like export settings, uh I just exported as um everything was. So export the ship at 496. Uh these two at 2048 and then all the rest at 1024. And I I think it works really good. It look it looks really nice in Blender. And yeah, I didn't export as a USD. I did the um I exported all the textures. And I did like the node wrangler um setting up the textures in Blender. So we'll show that now. Okay. So here's what the scene looks like um without post-processing and all that. Yeah. So this is my space scene. Uh I basically did everything that we talked about. Um, I used a very similar setup to the planet I made like earlier when we when we were messing around with making making the planet. Um, and same clouds as well because I thought they were really cool. Um, and then I added the um, Frenel as well. Uh, and I thought this was a good idea and I think it works pretty nicely was I also added a big huge volume around the whole thing. So this is that with it and that's it without it. So, I I think the volume was really cool and I think it really um in cycles. I mean, yeah, it looks especially nice in cycles. Um but yeah, I think the volume really works good there. Uh and I just have a big >> You made like a a sphere volume that's like just bigger than the planet. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would you know disperse all of the lighting more softly throughout the whole thing. >> And Yeah. And it it did something in EV as well. >> Yeah, pretty sure. I just I like how I think it >> Yeah. Yeah. Like it's a much more sophisticated volume rendering thing. >> Yeah. >> On it. Um and then that's where the sun is also coming from. I don't have to move the sun over to there, but it really helped me kind of like visualize what direction the uh the sun should come from. So I kind of like pointed it at the camera. Um, I decided to go for this lighting setup where it's like kind of a harsh lighting like on this side kind of just to, you know, really accentuate the fact there's only one light source out here. Um, however, the downside to that is it's a little dark to like it's a little dark to see everything, but I do really like like these really high contrast like shadows on it. I think it looks really cool, but in the post-process, what kind of lighting is this? thing. I tried to kind of bring out the bring out the shadows more. Um, what I did for the planet. Yeah, very similar to um what we did before and added the Fresnel as well. Then, yeah, I mean, also made the um that background in a different file. That's what it looks like. Uh I was having trouble having it come out like smaller. Like it's like it's like huge. That was a little annoying because I I think it looks kind of fake now with like how big it is. Um I'll move over to compositing. Yeah. So I had a pretty simple compositing setup. Um I didn't do the cryptomat because I really like the uh the glare that it ended up getting right here. Here's the final rendered image that I did. Um but I really liked like this these glares that it got on like all the highlights. So I didn't really feel a need to uh to cryptomat it. Uh but yeah, this is with the glare on to make the sun just super bright so it actually looks like a sun, not um that Uh yeah, this is my compositing. Um yeah, I did multiple I did two different glares at the same time to give the do the streaks and the fog glow. Did color correction too. So um I tried to increase the shadows a little bit. Yeah, I messed around a little bit with with the settings, but very subtle changes I think um do a lot. That's that's everything. Thank you and goodbye. Awesome. Looks really good. Yeah, I mean the renderer looks really good. the, you know, the main thing here is that we want to get some >> really >> more lights in here that are just going to, you know, highlight some of our details here so we can see some of the work that went into what's happening here, right? So I mean this is part of the uh again kind of what we've been talking about with some of the other things where like you start with something that's informed by the real world and informed by physics and infor but then at the end of the day you want to make the best looking image possible right and so then yeah like is is there primarily a singular singular light source in space yeah and that's part of the re from what I understand like part of the reason a lot of actual footage for as much as we have actual footage from face, which is not, you know, a lot. Um, it looks quote unquote fakeish sometimes. Um, is that, you know, things are falling off uh into completely uh digital blackness and um, you know, very very hard lighting, right? So the yeah, of course there's the then the the refaked fake moon landing stuff. Um, you know, here you we get this really, you know, like 100% dark shadow here, right? Because we're not getting any ambient light. Like even on, you know, the moon in this particular instance, there's no real atmosphere as far as I understand to speak of. Uh and so like really a total lack of ambient light, right? The kind of thing that's like impossible to reproduce on Earth. Um and that there wouldn't so yeah having this one really strong directional source and something to make that sun appear in the render, but then we need to be doing something to actually um show off the rest of the detail of the of the thing we're making there. some fill light and some other lights there.

So, that's a good idea too in terms of like I was when I was messing around with the uh texture I made, you know, we put it on the uh world and that's there primarily for reflections, but it's really not doing anything for us reflection wise, right? like like none of that stuff is right enough to make any of that work. And so um it would be much easier to wrangle how it looks on a plane than it would be to get into all the scale settings on the world, you know, spherical projection. So the the ship design is really cool. The only thing that's not um working for me are, you know, these are definitely sort of, you know, like definitely substance painter decals. Um like especially this the idea of having it be a pirate ship is cool, but I I'm envisioning these fins. What if this was more like uh what we see on the tails of planes, right? where like maybe this it would be a lot more interesting visually if it was the skull itself but just maybe like half of it here you know like how things don't just taking the whole thing and fitting it on the fin isn't very interesting from a design perspective uh as opposed to you know if this were the fin you know the just part of it is what we're seeing over here uh on the thing and then maybe masking out this line because it just reads as like obviously poison bottle decal. Um, and the rest of it is like detailed enough that it kind of undermines what you're doing there. I think it fit well for because my spaceship is a bit longer.

Okay, we don't need this open right now. There we go. And is this at the Yeah, let's get out of there. And this is the volume right here. Okay, you can get rid of that for now. >> Yeah, it definitely helps fill in some of these some of the gap there between those things. That sort of makes that a little bit better. Um, okay. So, uh, and then there we go. get to see what's going on with the compositing uh in the view. And so this is good, but you know, there's a lot more detail to Jack ship and everybody else was also running into this issue where let's uh do something to make this look a little bit more so we can have some more detail on the ship. And so we need some smaller lights that aren't going to mess up, you know, the rest in in real life. If there were smaller lights around this, you know, lighting this spaceship, then um none of it would fall onto the planet because we really have even though we made planet very big, you know, relative to the ship, it's still not even close to like what scale would be, right? Because the the whole thing would be the file would be gigantic or I mean the not it's not like you'd have a lot of memory in it. It would just be really hard to manage the scale of it. So, uh let's turn these off now. And the thing we want to do here is some uh light linking. We want some lights that only light the spaceship. So, actually, I'll put the planet back on so we can test what's happening. And am I looking through the camera right now? No. Okay. Uh, and so let's grab the uh ship. There we go. And if I were to make another um point light here and so I can see what's going on with it. There we go. And so let's look at this. Move this over here. And then probably up a little bit. And to get this uh brighter, our exposure is going to make it much much brighter, much much faster. And so we can see what's going on there. Our radius, right? So the bigger this is, the sort of softer the light is. Um, and so something like this to just sort of throw some extra light onto what we're seeing. Let's Okay. So now uh again, right? So, we're getting some, you know, we're able to see some of what's going on in here with the detail. And let's get a little bit more of this happening perhaps over in this side. And so, I'll call this uh you know, fill light and the we don't want this to affect the planet system. And so on the fill light under object under shading under light linking you can say new and then drag the spaceship in there so that this is only going to affect the spaceship. Uh in this case want to get all of the spaceship stuff in there. This might be easier to put the spaceship in its own collection. Or was it already just it was the only thing in this collection? I'll just name this collection spaceship. Now, under light linking on our fill light here, remove that and drag down that. Okay. So, we can know that that's not going to bother this other stuff down here. And we can then adjust this to give ourselves some more And again, I'm going to overshoot so that um if I need to tamp it down, I can always do that later in compositing, right? Especially because it's all in the spaceship. Crypto map of the spaceship. And then you can give your own color correction node to the spaceship. Um, now let's see if we can get a few more glints of light maybe on the spaceship in some other areas. And so I'll take this light here, um, this fill light and I'll control crl + v it. And >> did I Oh, no. It's just right there. Okay, it went into that. There we go. Feel like two. Let's look at this from the top. And I'm going to move this one a little bit further away. And come back and look through the camera. And let's move this one up. I'm going to make the radius smaller. so that it's more of a hard light. And then Let's turn the original fill light off so we can know that we're looking at just this effect right now. Yeah, this copied the settings here. Why are we not seeing any effect here? Is there some problem with this? No, it's in the compositing. Yeah. Something weird with the light linking. So, turning this down. The other thing we can do here is this. So, under influence for this light here, um the diffuse light is just sort of the basic what's filling things in. If we were to zero that out, you'll see what happens now. It's just kind of what's happening with the gloss areas. So, transmission doesn't need to be going to volume scatter, just on the glossy there. And so, you can see how that affects what's happening. Let's give it some more. And now that it's doing what we want, let's find a angle where it's going to give some more action like the edge of the object. So small. So we're getting this very hard directional light. Um no diffuse, right? Because otherwise it' just be sort of like filling in the whole thing in a dumb way. Uh just having the glossy on it here. And so there's this one is we'll call this um specular light. specular being the reflection of the light sources. And there it is with the the fill. And so these two things are separate now. the amount of specular getting out. And then this essentially should be creating these much much much harder spots that will um start to activate some of our compositing glow for instance. And so the specular light here Now it does cast the shadows over to the other side and so you could just sort of opt out of the shadowing for this one. So most of the shadows are still being motivated from this side. But now we just get way more information about what's happening here with Jack's ship than what we had previously. So you without this and this right just nothing there. Now with this and this we could still make it darker later but there's information to be stepped on. Before there wasn't anything of the kind there. The other thing that we could do here to give it a little bit more uh difference is perhaps give some of these a little bit different flavor. Just very slight. And so this was more over hereish. And then perhaps this maybe was a bit over there to sort of give you some change in color value across the surface. Something to make it a little bit more uh pronounced there. Great. So if the lights that you add",
    "transcript_segment": "those situations here. I think Jack's opened here. And if we look at this, do I have anything else open? Okay, we don't need this open right now. There we go. And is this at the Yeah, let's get out of there. And this is the volume right here. Okay, you can get rid of that for now. >> Yeah, it definitely helps fill in some of these some of the gap there between those things. That sort of makes that a little bit better. Um, okay. So, uh, and then there we go. get to see what's going on with the compositing uh in the view. And so this is good, but you know, there's a lot more detail to Jack ship and everybody else was also running into this issue where let's uh do something to make this look a little bit more so we can have some more detail on the ship. And so we need some smaller lights that aren't going to mess up, you know, the rest in in real life. If there were smaller lights around this, you know, lighting this spaceship, then um none of it would fall onto the planet because we really have even though we made planet very big, you know, relative to the ship, it's still not even close to like what scale would be, right? Because the the whole thing would be the file would be gigantic or I mean the not it's not like you'd have a lot of memory in it. It would just be really hard to manage the scale of it.

So, actually, I'll put the planet back on so we can test what's happening. And am I looking through the camera right now? No. Okay. Uh, and so let's grab the uh ship. There we go. And if I were to make another um point light here and so I can see what's going on with it. There we go. And so let's look at this. Move this over here. And then probably up a little bit. And to get this uh brighter, our exposure is going to make it much much brighter, much much faster. And so we can see what's going on there. Our radius, right? So the bigger this is, the sort of softer the light is. Um, and so something like this to just sort of throw some extra light onto what we're seeing. Let's Okay. So now uh again, right? So, we're getting some, you know, we're able to see some of what's going on in here with the detail. And let's get a little bit more of this happening perhaps over in this side. And so, I'll call this uh you know, fill light and the we don't want this to affect the planet system. And so on the fill light under object under shading under light linking you can say new and then drag the spaceship in there so that this is only going to affect the spaceship. Uh in this case want to get all of the spaceship stuff in there. This might be easier to put the spaceship in its own collection. Or was it already just it was the only thing in this collection? I'll just name this collection spaceship. Now, under light linking on our fill light here, remove that and drag down that. Okay. So, we can know that that's not going to bother this other stuff down here. And we can then adjust this to give ourselves some more And again, I'm going to overshoot so that um if I need to tamp it down, I can always do that later in compositing, right? Especially because it's all in the spaceship. Crypto map of the spaceship. And then you can give your own color correction node to the spaceship. Um, now let's see if we can get a few more glints of light maybe on the spaceship in some other areas. And so I'll take this light here, um, this fill light and I'll control crl + v it. And >> did I Oh, no. It's just right there. Okay, it went into that. There we go. Feel like two. Let's look at this from the top. And I'm going to move this one a little bit further away. And come back and look through the camera. And let's move this one up. I'm going to make the radius smaller. so that it's more of a hard light. And then Let's turn the original fill light off so we can know that we're looking at just this effect right now. Yeah, this copied the settings here. Why are we not seeing any effect here? Is there some problem with this? No, it's in the compositing. Yeah. Something weird with the light linking. So, turning this down. The other thing we can do here is this. So, under influence for this light here, um the diffuse light is just sort of the basic what's filling things in. If we were to zero that out, you'll see what happens now. It's just kind of what's happening with the gloss areas. So, transmission doesn't need to be going to volume scatter, just on the glossy there. And so, you can see how that affects what's happening. Let's give it some more. And now that it's doing what we want, let's find a angle where it's going to give some more action like the edge of the object. So small. So we're getting this very hard directional light. Um no diffuse, right? Because otherwise it' just be sort of like filling in the whole thing in a dumb way. Uh just having the glossy on it here. And so there's this one is we'll call this um specular light. specular being the reflection of the light sources. And there it is with the the fill. And so these two things are separate now. the amount of specular getting out. And then this essentially should be creating these much much much harder spots that will um start to activate some of our compositing glow for instance. And so the specular light here Now it does cast the shadows over to the other side and so you could just sort of opt out of the shadowing for this one. So most of the shadows are still being motivated from this side. But now we just get way more information about what's happening here with Jack's ship than what we had previously. So you without this and this right just nothing there. Now with this and this we could still make it darker later but there's information to be stepped on. Before there wasn't anything of the kind there. The other thing that we could do here to give it a little bit more uh difference is perhaps give some of these a little bit different flavor. Just very slight. And so this was more over hereish. And then perhaps this maybe was a bit over there to sort of give you some change in color value across the surface. Something to make it a little bit more uh pronounced there. Great. So if the lights that you add"

See how that works with this as some sort of exhaust coming out the back. Come back over here. Yeah, we can see some of it. might make it a little bit more pronounced in this direction. And so let's come into here. So if you're already, you know, on the edge of your computer's capability, maybe let's see how this one goes. Select the cylinder. Go to shading view down here. And let's make a new material and call this like exhaust. And uh we're going to use a volume. So, we will come out the volume here and we'll use the um we use the the volume there and so you can kind of see what's happening. Um we get this volume like area. Let's get we need to have it change over the length. And so we need a um if I go control T. There we go. It gives me this mapping. And the mapping for the I think we're going to want the generated normals here going to a generated um going to a gradient. or actually just a um it's easier to visualize with a ramp up. And so this goes into here. And I'm just going to make this obvious colors here. So this one I'll make really orange. And this one I'll make like kind of bluish. And this needs to go into here. And let's look over here. Okay. So, you can see what's happening there. We're going from orange to blue, but not quite in the way that we want. What do I put object in here? There we go. That gives me what I want. I actually want the No, that's about it. So, kind of like so. And then we want the density to sort of cool off here. Why we have that slant there? Um, so Crl + V. And actually, we just want a regular black and white one now. And this needs to go into the density. Let's look. And so now Yeah. So, our color into density there. See how that makes part of it transpar like see through there. But we want the other thing. We want it sort of trailing off on that side like so. And let's run some of this into the emission. Getting there. Right. So we, you know, essentially taking a great just mapping stuff along the length of this. Um, what does generated look like? That's not quite right. Really be that one. What does this one look like? Object is what we want here. Um, okay. Getting there. Let's check this through. Okay. And if we were to just turn up the intensity of the emission here on the uh volume Not getting anything happening there even though we are looking through the compositor. Why is this not activating our emission strength? Oh, I'm just in the wrong thing there. There we go. Now we're getting what we want. See where I'm going with this now? Okay. So, the emission strength, right? Our exhaust, we need to have this. The more I cut it off here on the end. Let's see. Let's look again from the top. Maybe this needs to go into emission strength as well to sort of curb the emission strength. But the problem is I can't crank it now, right? And so that's always solved with a which node multiply. Take the same thing and just multiply it. So if this comes into here, this comes into here. Now we still get the gradient, but we should be able to crank the gradient like so. There we go. Now we can sort of control this. Getting there. And you know how blue the sections are. You if you want to have some more adventurous exhaust of different kinds. There we go. And if we went back and looked at this, let's look at through the Right. And so this is light wrapping around back here. That's looking pretty cool. I mean, that's kind of cool as is, but I want some more noise here, right? I mean, I hear your uh objections about fire in space and whatnot, and I am ignoring them. Um the you know this this is a pretty good setup as is here. So uh for again I made some sort of primitive that's going to occupy the space of the of the flame. Then uh ran the principal de deleted the principal BSDF added the principal volume added that to volume. The main things here are getting this gradient ramp that controls color and emission color. And yeah, I ended up using a control T to get my texture coordinates. And object is giving me what I want right now because I that should Why is it not turning with the object? Oh. Uh, because I haven't provided the object. Is that right? Now's the turn with the object. For the love of Christ. Uh, here we go. Yes. You have to tell it which object. Not the object you're connected to. Sure. And so here. Yeah. So depending on the view, it's kind of giving us what we want. So, this is good for this exhaust. Also, Alec, I'm looking at you with your laser firing onto the surface, right? It's just a much longer, thinner cylinder of laser fire. Um, and then, yeah, if we want to break this up some more, we need some noise. And we need to composite the noise with this gradient. And so shift a uh noise texture and we need to mix it here after this ramp. And so we need to eat into the bright part because we want the black part to stay white. And so we want to make it darker. Then we want to make the white part break it up with dark patterns. And so what blend mode are we going to need here? And we'll make the bright darker. Yeah, darken multiply. And so here to A, here into B. Finding the scale for the noise may be a little tricky here, but we'll see. Uh, and then multiply this value into all of the what's going on there. And let's see if we can see if we put zero and then sort of shift drag it up. We probably want a pretty small value. If we look at it from the top, can we see a little bit more detail what's going on? Um, and so there's that one. Where else is this going? Oh, to the density. Oh, I didn't put in the right blend mode. Darken. We'll check multiply first. And there we go. And there we go. We can start to see this break up. Noise looks all stretched. I think I didn't apply scale. There we go. So, we want a much smaller pretty. There we go. That's what I'm talking about. All right. Um, now we're now we're doing something. Um, yeah. So now how far this reaches is yeah. So let's look at this mapping object feed the object. Mapping goes into our ramps. One ramp to control color. Color is going to both color and emission color. I'm not sure if it even matters that it's going to color at this point. Let's see if I disconnect this. Does it look different? Yeah, mostly emission right now. But this part gets a little white there. So we want that blocked out. So leave that connected. Now over here, um, this is controlling essentially the alpha of the volume multiplied by the noise texture which is here. um and then multiply it again into the emission strength so that we can crank it to get that um uh bloom activation. And now here there we go. That's looking much better. Um yeah, you could spend a little bit of time, you know, modeling like some other shape here, you know, beyond just uh this, but um that's going to get you in the ballpark there for a lot of that. And then this is going to allow you to really crank this up. You know, the again, noise is just room for experimentation here, depending on what you'd be looking for. Yeah, sure. That's fine. Yeah. And then since we got the bloom on, gives us that cool light wrap around there. And if we turn the planet back on, And here, do you have a Fresnel layer on here? >> Okay. >> The mispass. Yeah. Yeah. Let's look at that as well. But now we can see all the work that Jack put into this. Right. Right. So there's, you know, part of it making a compelling render. The other part is that we want it to look like something. I mean, also the the ship is the star of the show. Okay. So in your case, maybe there's a maybe moving restaging the planet. Don't have the planet be you want the planet to intersect a little bit with the ship. Otherwise, I don't think that's really great from a composition standpoint. But maybe if it was like this, that's going to give us a lot more dark background. Maybe change some of the background back there. The Oh, it's down here, right? Yours is in the world.",

See if we change the scale of this whether we can get some more Let's say 555. Actually, if all the numbers are the same, I think it's when I ran into that problem. Yeah, this this the math gets weird here. Um We can just see a lot more of what's going on with the ship. You know, the, you know, this definitely adds a lot. And yeah, still feels like primarily motivated the light happening over here, but um yeah, we could step on this later in compositing to sort of, you know, isolate the ship and work from there on it, but I think it gives you a little bit better. And then the Yeah, the sun here. But that's that sun. Yeah. Where's the the other sun? The one that's lighting the planet, isn't it? This Yeah. Is there like will your Fresnel emission? Yeah. Yeah. That's the clouds. Okay. Yeah. So you can uh have more control over this running this into a ramp. So the frenel and now I can move that much much closer to the edge to get us much darker over here. Uh give us that line. And so now our fill light given that a different color quality. Our specular light. There we go. And then this is the sun over there. And then yeah, let's save incremental. And yeah, so the other pass uh our link was mentioning was the mist pass which is essentially the depth into the scene which can be used in the composite. So, as things get further from the camera, I mean, let's look at some reference here. So, I've been watching myself and I've been watching Brave New Worlds, this new Star Trek show, which I think is great. Uh, but the opening title sequence is really good. Um, you know, it's the old it's it takes place before the 1960 Star Trek, you know, in the Star Trek timeline. Obviously, it's made now. Uh but uh um some really great spaceship work, you know, because the original show like the 1960s William Shatner Leonard Nemoy show, um the opening sequence, the title sequence for the show was all the ship, you know, kind of sort of like zooming by. And then even the music, they kind of um uh worked on that. You know, there's our Substance Painter hexcomb pattern right there. Um so we got a little heat distortion happening on this. So, some of you guys who have these tiny windows, having an a noise go to the emission so that they all don't light up exactly the same might be something to check out. But yeah, it starts off with a lot of this uh we see the windows of the ship in the lights light up one by one. Yeah, it's really nice. This is uh there's some there's this one volutric cloud shot which is just like I mean the whole thing is really good. Um yeah and so it's it is you know like the 1960s design which is a little you know quoteunquote corny but they've really sort of like updated it and so like yeah a lot you know we've got our paneling here. Oh that was the other thing the procedural bolts. Look at that maybe. Um, but yeah, a lot of blur, uh, procedural motion blur there. All right. So, this is our project right here, like straight up. Um, you know, so this they've already established the scale of the ship. So, here, you know, giving the planet more gravitas, but, you know, we we're only going to have a couple shots. And so, we want to have a little bit more, you know, there. But the you can see a lot of the similar things that we've been doing. Um, yeah, some really great space work here. Um, same kind of stuff, right? A lot of you guys did stuff like this throughout the entire thing. Again, like uh I mean this is the YouTube, you know, rip of whatever you know this is. And so, you know, this is falling off onto pretty dark areas, but um yeah, again, we're trying to balance it and that we do want to show off some of the work we've done here, but also see some of the detail. Here's a you know, definitely more well exposed shot where we can see a lot of the detail on the ship as it's sort of like flying through this ice area. Oh, yeah. This shot is just like killer. Yeah. coming out of the nebula there. Nebula just looks like great. So, some procedural noise on what's going on there. And they go back to the space station a lot. And this is some shots of the space station. Yeah. But I think really useful in that this, you know, the spaceship design isn't like bananas. Um, but like the texturing carries a lot of the of the work there. Um, so us being able to do that, you know. So maybe this does seem, you know, especially after watching that, this seems like pretty well lit here. And so, you know, maybe this fill light gets backed off a little bit. And maybe our specular light just a touch again. Airing on the side. ering on the side of it being a little overexposed knowing that you can, you know, uh, stomp on it later. And then, yeah, mostly the, you know, like it's mostly space out there. It's not, it's really not that much stuff. Um, and so, um, you know, it really allows this the ship to speak a little bit more against the background there. Um, yeah. So re, you know, adjusting your lights here so we get a better look on this, the feedback that I gave everybody individually. Uh, trying to keep everything a little bit better. What does this look like when we put our volume back in here? Oh, I didn't move the volume. Although the way the volume interacts with the world is super cool. This is this was the other idea I had was um how the volume's interacting with that volume in a weird way. Why would that all of a sudden go in front weird? Yeah. Yeah. So, another way to maybe make, you know, some even if it's a little bit, you know, displaced like that and then, you know, this sun probably gets more action if that comes up past that a little bit. But then this volume here playing with the density of that although it's I don't know why that's doing that weird thing to this volume. So, uh I honestly have no idea there. That's tough. But I mean, even without that. Yeah. So, I know a bunch of you probably gonna want to use this. Um, what was the other thing I wanted to do? Oh, Bose's um let's look at Substance Painter. the",

That's the clouds. Okay. Yeah. So you can uh have more control over this running this into a ramp. So the frenel and now I can move that much much closer to the edge to get us much darker over here. Uh give us that line. And so now our fill light given that a different color quality. Our specular light. There we go. And then this is the sun over there. And then yeah, let's save incremental. And yeah, so the other pass uh our link was mentioning was the mist pass which is essentially the depth into the scene which can be used in the composite. So, as things get further from the camera, I mean, let's look at some reference here. So, I've been watching myself and I've been watching Brave New Worlds, this new Star Trek show, which I think is great. Uh, but the opening title sequence is really good. Um, you know, it's the old it's it takes place before the 1960 Star Trek, you know, in the Star Trek timeline. Obviously, it's made now. Uh but uh um some really great spaceship work, you know, because the original show like the 1960s William Shatner Leonard Nemoy show, um the opening sequence, the title sequence for the show was all the ship, you know, kind of sort of like zooming by. And then even the music, they kind of um uh worked on that. You know, there's our Substance Painter hexcomb pattern right there. Um so we got a little heat distortion happening on this. So, some of you guys who have these tiny windows, having an a noise go to the emission so that they all don't light up exactly the same might be something to check out. But yeah, it starts off with a lot of this uh we see the windows of the ship in the lights light up one by one. Yeah, it's really nice. This is uh there's some there's this one volutric cloud shot which is just like I mean the whole thing is really good. Um yeah and so it's it is you know like the 1960s design which is a little you know quoteunquote corny but they've really sort of like updated it and so like yeah a lot you know we've got our paneling here. Oh that was the other thing the procedural bolts. Look at that maybe. Um, but yeah, a lot of blur, uh, procedural motion blur there. All right. So, this is our project right here, like straight up. Um, you know, so this they've already established the scale of the ship. So, here, you know, giving the planet more gravitas, but, you know, we we're only going to have a couple shots. And so, we want to have a little bit more, you know, there. But the you can see a lot of the similar things that we've been doing. Um, yeah, some really great space work here. Um, same kind of stuff, right? A lot of you guys did stuff like this throughout the entire thing. Again, like uh I mean this is the YouTube, you know, rip of whatever you know this is. And so, you know, this is falling off onto pretty dark areas, but um yeah, again, we're trying to balance it and that we do want to show off some of the work we've done here, but also see some of the detail. Here's a you know, definitely more well exposed shot where we can see a lot of the detail on the ship as it's sort of like flying through this ice area. Oh, yeah. This shot is just like killer. Yeah. coming out of the nebula there. Nebula just looks like great. So, some procedural noise on what's going on there. And they go back to the space station a lot. And this is some shots of the space station. Yeah. But I think really useful in that this, you know, the spaceship design isn't like bananas. Um, but like the texturing carries a lot of the of the work there. Um, so us being able to do that, you know. So maybe this does seem, you know, especially after watching that, this seems like pretty well lit here. And so, you know, maybe this fill light gets backed off a little bit. And maybe our specular light just a touch again. Airing on the side. ering on the side of it being a little overexposed knowing that you can, you know, uh, stomp on it later. And then, yeah, mostly the, you know, like it's mostly space out there. It's not, it's really not that much stuff. Um, and so, um, you know, it really allows this the ship to speak a little bit more against the background there. Um, yeah. So re, you know, adjusting your lights here so we get a better look on this, the feedback that I gave everybody individually. Uh, trying to keep everything a little bit better. What does this look like when we put our volume back in here? Oh, I didn't move the volume. Although the way the volume interacts with the world is super cool. This is this was the other idea I had was um how the volume's interacting with that volume in a weird way. Why would that all of a sudden go in front weird? Yeah. Yeah. So, another way to maybe make, you know, some even if it's a little bit, you know, displaced like that and then, you know, this sun probably gets more action if that comes up past that a little bit. But then this volume here playing with the density of that although it's I don't know why that's doing that weird thing to this volume. So, uh I honestly have no idea there. That's tough. But I mean, even without that. Yeah. So, I know a bunch of you probably gonna want to use this. Um, what was the other thing I wanted to do? Oh, Bose's um let's look at Substance Painter. the"

So, yeah, a lot of you have individual sub painting things to take care of, you know, like the Jolly Rodger flag and some of the other details there. Um, let's just look at a couple of those issues. So, that tiny tiny window lit up window idea. How do we get different values there? Um, I'm open sample. Yeah. So, just some test area here. Uh, let's make a new fill. And we want that pattern. Is there like a square noise? Oh, yeah. So, I mean, this is kind of working out of the box here. Let's see. Let's uh we're going to want this to go on the put it into the mask and I give myself some emission. And so in the checker settings here, right? And so this starts to give you some change in value there. If we don't want them all lined up or if we do and if we just wanted this, let's say there's no color there. We just have emission. If we go in here and add a levels to Why is it gray? Should be dark. Should be contrastier. Um, It's a little confusing. I think it would the dark part would be darker. Let's try a different approach. If we were to add a new fill layer, just turn this down. Yeah, that's black. Okay. And so now if I use this as a we just want to see the stuff on the emission. So there's not as much control here with this checker two as there is with the tiling thing. um with the tile generator. There we go. Uh under color. Yeah. So, randomly masking out some. I think that helps break it up. And then luminance by number. Oh, luminance random. There we go. And so that really helps sell those kind of sections as being smaller windows, right? That's our enterprise effect, you know, that we see some of them turn on. And so what if we wanted tiny detail over top of all those things? Um, we'd want to put something on top of that emission. So, add another fill on top. Black. Um, I'm going to take another noise pattern. Like this. There we go. And we want that, but we only want it inside the windows. And so in the emissive channel, let's put this in multiply mode. And there we go. Now we get that only inside the windows. You know, the amount of glare that it's going to give off, it's going to be a function of this stuff up here. But right now, they look like they have even more tiny detail. and you're using the tile generator and so the size and shape of the windows can be adjusted there. So that really gives you a good take on it. Yeah. So just multiplying this noise pattern over top of the window pattern. Then in the tile generator, making sure the random luminance really helps bring that to the next level in terms of making it read as windows, right? And they won't all sort of bunch together, right? And then this could be packaged together in a folder and masked in exactly where you want it on your ship.

And over here, um, we want this to be probably our panel generator or tile. There we go. I'm going to make these bigger. and more defined. Okay. Um, now we essentially need to create an outline around this that allows us to make like a dotted line. So, here's a new layer on top. This is some other color like that. And we want to read this mask data. I didn't make an anchor point. So, here, right click and add anchor point. And now up here in the we'll just keep working in the mask for now. Um, we need to read the anchor points with a fill effect. And so here, look at the anchor points and this one. So that does that. Now we want to expand this. And I believe that's going to be a filter. mask outline close. Okay. So, now we want it to be further out. It's part of the way and no blur. Okay. So now we want to break this up to make it look like you know little rivets. So we need to overlay uh the tile generator. So another fill effect. And on this one, we're getting the tile generator and we need to essentially multiply it onto there. Well, I think we need to invert it and then put it in multiply mode. Okay, we're getting somewhere. Um, and so now by adjusting this. It's starting to do it. Uh, it all needs to be much sharper. So sharpen. Let's see if our mask outline could be this sharpen is not doing it. We need a levels I think. So levels for the most extreme contrast. Uh, there we go. There we go. That gives us that. Right. So now no matter I would no matter what I would do here I would get this linked. So this is the you know rivet procedural rivets. And you know this could be darker and higher. and turn off the displacement. There we go. And metallic. Um, yeah, I mean massaging this levels would sort of get it to what you would want. But that's there. And so now, no matter what would happen here in my Yeah. In this right. So now I can change the size and shape of these tiles and still probably get procedural rivets. It kind of doesn't work in all instances. Maybe they're bigger. Yeah, right now we do because it does have that grid setting, but yeah, adjusting the tile generator up here and the levels. Is there something I give us? Yeah, I don't know. There's a lot of adjusting there. The only other thing I can think of is like you can read the pen tool. Black mask. Okay. It's repeating because of the UVs on this, I think. Yeah. But let's see if that works. Okay. So if that's there, it gives us a line. It could be the edge of a panel. You're able to procedurally move the points, but we're only having access to this through that I mean yeah I don't know I think this is still possible Cool. If you kept some sort of relationship between these tiles and these tiles I thought this was in the new stroke thing. The path tool. Is that a different tool? There's that thing there. Let's look at this. Okay, it's a little weird in that you don't get This gives you a way to procedurally place the rivets and adjust that after the fact, but I could use it to make the rivets and the line itself. How do Where is this? Because it's not on an effect here once I click off of it. Can I get back to this? Do I have to come back to here? Yeah. Then I just click on it and I get these controls again. Can I just duplicate this thing? You can select all the points. You can't duplicate it. So, it's like a live paint brush, you know, that you can go back and edit. If you painted a pattern and then you just duplicated the whole thing duplicate layer and this one it will be green or red or whatever. If I come back here into the mask is where I painted it. And so if I click on this again and now if I go control A and Now we just want to move the whole thing. Yeah. So this one's totally separate. So that one can be solid and thin and moved. Oh, here's the paths. Okay, they're up here. Okay, I just want to move all the points at the same time. There we go. Okay, that's cool. We figured that out. Let's do it again like for real. Okay, so yeah, using the path, right? So like you dup you draw the panels and then duplicate the path to make the rivets. So you know you'd have something like this. Let's make it just metallic. And then something like this, which is just going to be height information down. And we will uh add a black mask. And then this is going to be the uh panels. And so here in the black mask, we use the pen tool to draw said panels. There we go. And so now if we come back here, right, that's making that indent for the panels. Now we can uh duplicate this layer. and access the same stroke in the mask over here. And in the stroke settings here, well, first thing I would do is add the transform so you can offset it. So filter transform and then offset X offset Y and that sort of offsets it right. And now we just want a different pattern along here. And so on this one now the spacing is the primary thing. And so if you turn that up, you have to have it selected. Control A, I guess. There we go. So there's no anchor point for path yet. Something like that. It's probably I mean Yeah, you need to have something like that in order to have this kind of flexibility for it. But now like that's there and so that's close. You know, it's not going to give you that like on the outside every time, but it's reasonably procedural. I'll think about it some more, but that that seems like the best route so far. So that you could get that because then this is completely independent. These could go that way, you know, and you get something that looks about right there. Um,",

Uh yeah, with the Yeah, because I don't think you can scroll. Well, I mean, okay. So, if you put a transform on both of them. So this is where like this this this is where Substance Painter like this is like the frontier of Substance Painter at this point, right? This the the anchor points allow us to you know like nodal in like a nodal thing send data from one layer to another, but it's it's all texture data. There's no way to sort of connect It's all in this realm where it's like what what sort of like weird kind of hacky thing could do this right like because here this could totally work as long as I could I mean if I come down here and apply the same transform if I copy this and grab it here and then controlV now that lines up everywhere and then I can come in here and just sort of you know change one slightly and there I go right but then when I want to go back and change it I have to change this one and this one and so like there's as far as I'm aware like in a nodal situation these would be two different nodes and I could just run the same number to my scaling on both of these transform effects you know so which is what substance designer is all about right and so yeah your question is to like you're you're definitely that type of level proceduralism if you wanted to do that that's definitely in designer because designer is all nodes and then you'll be doing that right so this the reason that there isn't more development here with substance painter for this is because the people who want to get really serious about that are doing designer and then you just bring you export your designer as a smart material and bring it in here as a as a I mean, let's even look. Oh, yeah. I think I've followed this guy some. So, a lot of the same kind of ideas here, but you know, you're just working with that. Everything you're making is a procedural pattern, right? And so right where we use the tile generator is sort of like placing individual uh mask shapes that then are getting comped together here um in different modes and then blurring them in the height if they're running into the height is giving him the beveled edges on these kind of things. And so, you know, this is all, you know, like at a very granular level being comped together to make this material which could then be just laid on top of like some, you know, just planes and make it something that looks really um interesting. So, yeah, I mean, you're definitely in this territory at this point uh with trying to do trying to do that procedurally. So, you know, maybe once the semester's over and you've got some time, like like take some time and like look at substance some, you know, beginning substance designer stuff. But I mean obviously the the you know given your academic load the strategic answer here is just just draw the rivets by hand you know like on it and then call it a day here because like um yeah I think it's important for like your long-term development to sort of wrap your mind around being able to do that procedurally and people can think that way about this stuff that's not everyone and so I would encourage you to like pursue that But for a lot of like especially smaller projects being able to do something like this procedurally and I've definitely fallen victim to this is like like it's going to take me 30x the amount of time to develop the algorithm to do this thing that you know like if I just did it by clicking the dots it would take way less time but you know so but you know if you want to go on and do this more this particular kind of thing, you know, when you're doing, you know, if you're working on some sort of giant movie or giant video game, that's when it needs to be on this way, right? Like you can't like having hiring a hundred people to click the rivets in this entire world is not in the budget. And so we need someone to be able to design the procedural rigid rivet material to make that work. But yeah, it's definitely like right on the border of that kind of that kind of thing. But you can see like it's not a couple semesters we've do we did one or two substance designer projects but especially for 185 it's just like not the the juice is not worth the squeeze here in terms of like it is incredibly powerful program but the learning curve you know in terms of like all the nodes especially in 185 the class where like a lot of people come in not not even knowing what a material is Right. And then to throw someone into substance designer um is like just isn't very um you know applicable. Right. So so there's that you know but I mean that's reasonable. Just duplicating the layer and offsetting it will get you somewhere. And then yeah you can tile that pattern. And so you could sort of draw your own thing and then layer that across the entire thing.",

And so right where we use the tile generator is sort of like placing individual uh mask shapes that then are getting comped together here um in different modes and then blurring them in the height if they're running into the height is giving him the beveled edges on these kind of things. And so, you know, this is all, you know, like at a very granular level being comped together to make this material which could then be just laid on top of like some, you know, just planes and make it something that looks really um interesting. So, yeah, I mean, you're definitely in this territory at this point uh with trying to do trying to do that procedurally. So, you know, maybe once the semester's over and you've got some time, like like take some time and like look at substance some, you know, beginning substance designer stuff. But I mean obviously the the you know given your academic load the strategic answer here is just just draw the rivets by hand you know like on it and then call it a day here because like um yeah I think it's important for like your long-term development to sort of wrap your mind around being able to do that procedurally and people can think that way about this stuff that's not everyone and so I would encourage you to like pursue that But for a lot of like especially smaller projects being able to do something like this procedurally and I've definitely fallen victim to this is like like it's going to take me 30x the amount of time to develop the algorithm to do this thing that you know like if I just did it by clicking the dots it would take way less time but you know so but you know if you want to go on and do this more this particular kind of thing, you know, when you're doing, you know, if you're working on some sort of giant movie or giant video game, that's when it needs to be on this way, right? Like you can't like having hiring a hundred people to click the rivets in this entire world is not in the budget. And so we need someone to be able to design the procedural rigid rivet material to make that work. But yeah, it's definitely like right on the border of that kind of that kind of thing. But you can see like it's not a couple semesters we've do we did one or two substance designer projects but especially for 185 it's just like not the the juice is not worth the squeeze here in terms of like it is incredibly powerful program but the learning curve you know in terms of like all the nodes especially in 185 the class where like a lot of people come in not not even knowing what a material is Right. And then to throw someone into substance designer um is like just isn't very um you know applicable. Right. So so there's that you know but I mean that's reasonable. Just duplicating the layer and offsetting it will get you somewhere. And then yeah you can tile that pattern. And so you could sort of draw your own thing and then layer that across the entire thing."

Oh, well gone. done. And then you know I rotate the thing and rotate it as well and see. Okay, good. I mean, yeah. So, several weeks in a row now. Yeah, it's super low poly, right?

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 29, 2025 Student Feedback: Pirate Robot Character >> Hi, it's Crimson and this is my rigged character. So, I hate that thing. Okay, so here is a Warso. I have him posed here because it was fun to play around with. Um, and then I have my updated UVs to where things are scaled more properly so we can have more detail on them. Here's that. Let me get the back. There we go. So, here's >> Yeah, that all looks pretty good. I mean, at least it's I mean, seems fairly representative. I mean, this is the hat, I think. So, there's definitely going to be some squished, you know, textures there, but that's not uh terrible, I think, depending on how you texture the hat. But also, I'm not sure you ran the equalize island size. So, you can change the U. If you change the UV map, that means you need to go back to Substance Painter and update over there. The UV map doesn't change the rigging or the weight painting. It's just how they're placed in UV space. So, that is something that you could adjust after you've gotten through this part. >> Updated UVs. I've tried to shrink the hat ones cuz it doesn't need that many, but when I mess with it, then it ends up breaking the whole thing. So, I stopped trying to mess with it. So you would select these faces, Ctrl L to get the entire island, and then S to scale that down and then uh run the pack algorithm again, and it would repack. >> So there's the updated UV unwrapping. And then here is his rigged model. Um, one thing that's wrong with it are the knees. I have them over here for right now because like the whole thing like freaks out if they they get close and if I'm interacting with like his center right there like you can see like the elbow ones they stay and they move with the rig but the knee ones don't. And when I had the knees pulled further up because they can get a little closer. Yeah, I can get to like right here. But even when they're close like that, they don't move. And so it just like breaks his legs and hips, which isn't good. So yeah, there's that. >> Okay. I'm not sure you understand what these are. These are just where the knees are pointed. Okay. So that's this doesn't this should not be like on the knee as a controller for the knee because the foot is the whole leg is set up for inverse kinematics. And so the knee you kind of in order to get this very easy control to keep the feet on the ground you sac you know you sacrifice or the compromise is that you don't have direct control over the knee you just have where the knee is pointed. So yeah, it doesn't matter sort of like how far out they are. Although you know you want them to be too far so that's not you don't know where they are but you it's the direction that the knee is pointed at. So if you wanted to have this character open their stance a little bit you would move this over which would rotate the orientation of the leg. Right? So it's a point at thing. Um, we can move around his head. That little get a little rotation in there. Yeah. Who is that? Let's try not to let him have a broken neck. Um, the hand. I grabbed the hook, not the hand. There we Oh. Oh my goodness me. What happened here? That's where you want to grab. That's the controller right there. The box. >> Okay, that that does still work. Okay, it just needs to get the hand rotated. There we go. So, that still works. It ends up being a little freaky with like the top joint there, >> right? So, I mean, is your character going to do a shoulder roll? Right. I mean like the um yeah I mean the value proposition here is that it works really well for a lot of like baseline bipeds. It's not completely customized for every specific character. But yours is kind of robotic. So I guess when I you know when you presented it I didn't imagine the body you know deforming a whole bunch here. So I'm not sure how much you'll use those. But this joint like right here, it caves in. But that wouldn't that's not going to really be used. I don't >> Yeah. So I mean a couple people mentioned this like could I keep it from rotating so far? Yes. There's a rotation constraint uh bone constraint in this menu that you could also populate onto all of the objects thereby uh significantly increasing the complexity of what it is you're dealing with as especially as you constrain something contain constrain rotation on something that may also have constrained rotation. So, the much more direct way is that if you don't want the shoulder to do that, don't animate the shoulder doing that. That's just a much much cleaner way to go about it there, >> I think. >> Yeah. And then other arm little claw hand action. Pull that out. can re- rotate that. Um, the main thing that I thought >> So, you I mean, you're coming back and clicking on these. I mean, learning your G, R, and S will speed you up considerably. Here, >> was an issue here. Let me fix his little hips. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. um is this claw has extra bones than it should. So if I I am in pose mode. If I look at the armature, I don't know if you can still see. Yeah. Um there's this little bone like right here that is affecting the shape of it. That is not necessary. Same with these extra bones in the hook. I don't want the hook to be moving, >> right? So, the same thing there. Then don't move those bones. Right. Like that's the the miximo the good part about it is that it's it gives a pretty great first pass on getting an existing biped skeleton weighted to characters of like surprisingly different bipedish proportions. What it's not doing is like looking at your character and figuring out that you have a claw hand and a hook and adjusting the underlying skeleton. That that would be a level of complexity that just is not, you know, like you'd have to do that yourself. There's no nothing that's going to like figure that out automatically. Um, so I mean the character is great. It looks expressive. The important part here is your character design. is good. Like everyone is into that. I mean, it looks like a robot pirate. Yeah. Like the second you see it, I think robot pirate pirate robot. Um and so that's I think you're you're good there. Um yeah. Okay. So that that got through the system fairly fairly well, right? You just would not be uh animating that thumb bone there because it's kind of deformed the thing. Okay, great. little faster this week. Here's Bo. >> Hey, good morning class 200. Um, this is what I got for this week. Going over last week's review and what Casey did. Um, which I kept. Uh, cuz I really like that. I didn't even think about making like a filigree or anything, but now and going forward in the future, I shall. So, everybody saw what Casey did with the hat, you know, got the filigree in there, like embroidered the gold, which came out very well. Uh, like that idea. And then >> Yeah. What kind of wizard doesn't have filigree, right? Like that's not a wizard you want to be. You know, >> I hate this. I made him a belt for his new kilt. The one thing I don't like though is how rigid it is. Even with the shade smooth on, it just I don't know. I think it's the way that I I loop cuted the thing, the mesh, but um that's something I could probably fix a little bit later. But yeah, made him a little leather belt.",

I mean, as far as I can tell, really good use of, you know, like how many characters need to have a modeled belt buckle, right? And so painting the belt buckle in the texture. Well done. >> Yeah, it's got a really small texture. uh but a gold buckle and then yeah from last week's uh review. So yeah, I like that. I like that how the the embroidery came out all around it. And then for the blender mesh. So here he is with the staff that I made. Everything's all one piece. So we go into pose mode. Can make his arm and the staff move over here with his legs. I do have to do some more weight painting because I didn't I did this at work because I had a dumb question that I made it I fixed it. So yeah, not a lot. It's weight painted right now. But yeah, it does work. Works out pretty good. It's pretty pretty flexible. So if you come over here to the upper back, it can bend pretty much at the waist. But this one too. This one will bend at the waist, you know, pretty well. Same with his uh the headbone. Yeah, he can shake his head. Yes, he agrees. So, um, another question that I would have is if we're going to implement things like if our characters could pick up and hold after the fact in the game, how would we make that work? I know parenting and stuff like that, but would you just have to make it like animate it to where it was like there and then turn it off or I'm not sure how that would work. So, that would be my question for this week. Um, if we're going to add something else in game that the character could pick up or maybe hold, how would we make that work in the game? Or would that just be a bunch of pariting with animations? Um, but yeah, other than that, we'll get a little X-ray. You can see his bones again. Uh, so I had to go all the way through the staff. I might have been able to parent one to them. >> Uh, okay. I mean, it's working. This this I mean, unless this is going to be like a a floppy snake like thing, this is totally unnecessary, right? Like Yeah. You um, so Now as a parent I can say this with uh some authority. Dynamic parenting is difficult. Um the right so picking up and parent and putting things down is essentially that you know like something was not apparent of something else and then becomes apparent of something else. Um, and so what usually causes a lot of problems is dynamically sort of putting inserting something into the hierarchy, which is exactly what dynamic parenting uh implies. And so with that in mind, um I think there's not quite the level of understanding we need here about this. We have these constraints that we're using mostly created by the rigging system. Um and the constraints can function like parenting without the hierarchy. So, um, yeah, picking stuff and putting it picking having your character hold something is going to be a matter of applying a constraint in Unity, right? We don't want to do that here because it's going to be something that dynamically happens during the game. And so, constraining it to the bone, you know, probably the wrist bone or hand bone or something. Um, in fact, we'll do that today with the decal projector for the face. So, we can project onto uh the face or anything. So the staff there is something that you could adjust and use to use this so that you just have the staff as an object and then you can just if you want to have have him holding the staff the entire time just dynamically parent it to using the constraint in Unity. So all of this, it's not entirely obvious. All of the constraint stuff, the bone constraints, none of that transfers to Unity when we export the animations. All of that, all of the movement that's a result of either the IK or the damped track or the rotation constraint. All that just gets baked down into what were the positions and rotations of the bones as a result of those constraints and that is what gets transferred. Okay, the more the one level up procedural things, those don't get packaged into the FBX. The those are each software has their own way of doing those things. And so all that gets baked down into the bone key frames. And so yeah uh this would be a example of that. So let uh yeah I we'll I'll show you the constraint here in Unity a second and that will make more sense I think >> that one. But I wasn't too sure about parenting with bones since still pretty new at that. But yeah I think he came out well. >> Yeah. Yeah. Just got to work on the uh kilt. almost called it a skirt. It's a kilt. Kilt there for Morai. But yeah, character design looks great. Like the proportions are cool. Um the Yeah, it definitely reads as wizard now, not just, you know, random skeleton. Jack.",
    "transcript_segment": "And let's get some light right around here. >> Right. Really good. I mean, as far as I can tell, really good use of, you know, like how many characters need to have a modeled belt buckle, right? And so painting the belt buckle in the texture. Well done. >> Yeah, it's got a really small texture. uh but a gold buckle and then yeah from last week's uh review. So yeah, I like that. I like that how the the embroidery came out all around it. And then for the blender mesh. So here he is with the staff that I made. Everything's all one piece. So we go into pose mode. Can make his arm and the staff move over here with his legs. I do have to do some more weight painting because I didn't I did this at work because I had a dumb question that I made it I fixed it. So yeah, not a lot. It's weight painted right now. But yeah, it does work. Works out pretty good. It's pretty pretty flexible. So if you come over here to the upper back, it can bend pretty much at the waist. But this one too. This one will bend at the waist, you know, pretty well. Same with his uh the headbone. Yeah, he can shake his head. Yes, he agrees.

Yeah, my character's at an odd angle here because I want a grand reveal. So, um there you go. Um yeah, this was quite the uh adventure. Many layers and it it looks really cursed.

Like that's a level of, you know, like it I mean it's going to be it's supposed to be a scary game, right? So like >> So uh this is the character. Um I changed a lot of stuff around. Actually, I didn't change that much around, but uh I added these these little lines. U made the boots a little more textured and stuff. Um got rid of that like cotton overlay cuz it didn't look very good. And yeah, obviously added my face and used several layers several layers of masking and overlaying and um yeah uh it was quite the adventure and uh it was it was pretty fun. Yeah. And I also added uh this little logo up on the hat as well. Um and I tried to do the like built-in pixelated stuff but it didn't it didn't do exactly what I wanted to and I think it's just cuz there's so many layers and stuff. It was just like So I ended up still doing the thing I said, which was um downscaling it in Photoshop. We can take a look at that right now. Yeah. So I exported the um base color and the ambient occlusion and I overlaid them on top of each other in Photoshop. So that's the base color. This is the ambient occlusion. And then I stepped on like the colors, the amount of colors that was in it, and I like uh shrunk the entire image down to 512x 512 pixels. So this is that after all is said and done.

And I'm just going to uh serenade you all with the character with the uh destroyed textures on. Yep. That's him. Okay. I think that worked, you know, like like that has a specific stylized look to it. I think it's pixelated enough that it looks intentionally pixelated and not just like unintentionally crappy. Um, and so that that works. Um, and yeah, I think that that relieves me of the body horror I was experiencing looking at the hands. Um, so yeah, and I'm also realizing I didn't do the thing I want to do, which is like add the these extra stripes on the back and the stars. So, I'm also going to do that. Here he is uh doing a little jig. All All of the uh things can move. Um yeah, no no limits or anything, but um you know, if you keep it within reason, um it's okay. >> Yeah. I mean, when it's funny, like I don't know, just not a initial reaction I had when working with this stuff, but you know, like people are like, \"Well, when I bend it this way, it doesn't really look right.\" I'm like, \"Can you bend that way?\" Uh, you know, [Music] Oh, wow. Goodness gracious. So, what time of night is it at this point? >> It's pretty early. It's like >> maybe I'm also going to come back and change the uh like add some more texture to the to the clothing cuz I only exported the base color. So, none of that like cool um stuff came out. But I don't want like an actual height channel. But I'm probably going to like take that color and just like overlay onto Photoshop as well.

I mean um exporting the Unity preset would also give you the normal map. You can shrink the normal map. I would I would say try that first and not doing I would try just saving it again at 512 x 512 and see what that looks like. >> Yeah. And then the thing that I can't quite say with certainty that I have not done here is like posterizing the normal map is not going to be like that may do something interesting but like because of what the normal map is like we're storing this positional data as RGB data there like that's you know not I'm not sure what's going to what that's going to look like there but Um, yeah, just try shrinking it first to give you a little bit of surface texture there.

Uh, I Well, first of all, I gave her clothes. She's got some proper outfit now with a rolled up sleeve here and some pants with the cuffs. And I even added some uh length to her shirt to give her kind of like a a rim, not a rim, but like you know, some some length to her uh jacket. Uh because I thought that could kind of be a nice important part of uh the model as well. I did. So, with the uh wireframe, it's better. It's better in the arms. I took last week's advice and I I greatly improved uh the legs and the arms and that's helped me make uh different things. I did this one as a separate kind of mesh um because it wasn't really working well with doing that with the arms. And then the body kind of got heavier. Uh, I tried to rem meshify it. Um, but that didn't really work super well. Um, cuz it kind of it like deformed and it like made the normals go crazy. So, it's it's like this. It's not too bad. Uh, it's maybe a bit heftier than I'd like it to be, but it's uh it's not too bad. I I think Oh. Uh, the best parts are definitely like the flowers and the head. I kind of took the sculpt tools and I deformed the flowers a bit to give them more of an organic look, which I think looks nice. Uh, here is it the wireframe. Um, here is the armature. I really wanted to do it in the um the Miximo because I thought that looked like my character's fairly human shape. She's >> Yeah, it's got that really big head. So, >> got she's got parts to her that are pretty pretty human shaped. So, I thought that would work well in that. Um, but for some reason when I try to upload the character, it just like it gets to the part where it's uploading and then it's just kind of like I put all the pieces together and it's like gives me a a weird error. So, as you can see, I haven't really uh here and then like wrists. Uh, I don't know if it's the big flower. I don't know. Or to other people's big heads, but maybe that one's just too confusing. I'm also wondering if the issue is um related to why she's all silver. Uh, I'm not really sure why she's all silver. I brought the meshes meshes back out from Substance Painter because I unwrapped them in Substance Painter and I figured, you know, you need the unwrapped meshes and I brought them into Blender and then when I bring them into Blender, it kind of um made her all silver. So, I mean, you're in the solid view, so so you're not going to see the textures. And then yeah it the the textures are not stored in the mesh they're separate the and also as I said previously like there's a fork in the workflow here right the blender stuff happens with the rigging the substance stuff happens with the painting and then they come back together in Unity we don't need to bring the textures back into Blender there right remember Unity is what we care about because that's where the game happens. So, they may be there. We're in the wrong view to see them because we're over here. Maybe you click this button in a minute. Um, so there's that. Yeah. And then uh the orientation of the character didn't look quite right. We went over that before with uh when we look at it from the side, the character should be facing this way with the Y orientation um and the Y arrow pointed this way. uh in order to get the what we have done several times is like the no problem when we've done the characters bringing them up and then reorienting them in Miximo that was less than great results and then yeah the character's head is so big that when you you know like put the elbows you know like the elbows are actually the point is here and you know I don't know exactly how that algorithm works, but it's probably some kind of um you know, like how the rendering works, you know, like it shoots a ray in space and the first face that that ray hits is uh what it thinks is the elbow, right? And so it, you know, it's not smart enough to know that like this is part of the head that's in front of there. And so in your case, um, yeah, you sent it to me. If we have time here at the end, maybe sending the headless character to Miximo and then parenting the, um, head because that's, you know, like all of this should be weighted 100% to the head. Also be care I mean because of the character design um you know this character is not going to be able to turn his head a whole lot um right because I mean having the pedals deform as you know running into that's all beyond our scope for sure but yeah a headless transfer not something I thought I'd say today may be what we need there we'll see here in a What's that? >> Right.

What am I going to tell you about this over here in the UV space? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you're just, you know, there's all all of the pixels, all these pixels. The computer can only digest chunks of square data because of the way the hardware is set up, right? And so even though all of the detail or all of the stuff that's going to actually appear on screen is down here, all of this still needs to get loaded. It's not like it's going to skip this stuff because there's nothing there, right? Um and so um yeah, I would but I think this is not a big fix if you just went back to Blender and you don't even need to do any fancy UV algorithms. You just need to select all this stuff and scale it because it's in a square area and just scale it up so it fills the square area a little bit better. Then in substance here, go to project and reload the one with the fixed UVs. And I think because it saves the strokes in sort of world space, it should I don't think you're even going to need to paint repaint the face. The rest of it should just I think it should be a pretty clean fix there. Just a matter of scaling this up in Blender, reexporting the FBX, importing the FBX here into this document. Don't make a new document because that means you will lose all of the stuff you've done. just open up this project settings for this document and replace the FBX with the one with the better UVs. >> Does that make sense? >> Okay. >> Layers correctly did it here. >> And so yeah, basically and also had some issues like getting this like textured all textured version of my character with everything I did in here into Blender. So yeah, but but here's first I'll just anyways I'll just start off with what I main thing I did this week is I actually just started actually here in Substance Painter started from scratch on a whole new like just brought it the old FBX back in again the second time. Started over made the put painted the character again. Did it more properly and also got it proper UV unwrapped this week. Thankfully, I unwrapped the auto here and it came through correctly where it's last week it was kind of messed up. So, >> yeah, I mean this this is good in that there's no I mean all this green speckle is a little worrisome in that I'm not sure what that is. Do you go back to Blender here at any point? >> I do. character I modeled in Blender. That's it. So that's my question. >> What's your question? >> I saw this file bring it in. >> So I try. >> Okay. And now we know that. >> Well, no, that that's that's at the beginning of this process when you go over to Substance Painter, right? You don't need to take it from Substance Painter to Blender. We're going to go from Substance Painter to Unity, right? So, just to be There we go. Uh in Substance Painter, what's going to come out of Substance Painter? Only textures, right? So when we export from substance painter we will get a folder of PGs. Uh what's going to come out of Blender? What we dealt with on Monday. Um one FBX for each animation run idle jump. And then these come together in Unity. Yeah. And so if you were coming back, if you were ultimately rendering in Blender, this is what you would want to do. We bring in the USD, but it doesn't have any of the textures, right? Is that what you were saying? >> Right. And so that's the um I mean, you took 185 already, right? Or no, >> no, I never had. >> Okay. Yeah. So the um using that um node wrangler brings all that in. So you've got everything you need there to bring it back to Blender. But we don't need to do that here because we're going to >> Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. the brute. >> That's right. And and then we'll because because the character that is animated and the character that was painted have the same UVs, then that'll work. But you need to fix your I would say at this point let's just move forward, right? So you have something that works here, right? Is it the most effective UV map? You know, we talked about why it's not, right? But you got to get the rigging and animation happening. So it's a UV map that'll work. you know, it's not going to be so unperformant that it'll crash your game. It'll just, you know, it may run at like 100 frames per second instead of 120 frames per second, right? So, so people will complain online about that. Uh, yeah, I'm just joking, right? No one's going to complain about that because if they will, I I'll yell at them. So, >> I didn't get any direct feedback on the topology or the texture, but I I fixed the seam placement and I I figured out a different way to do the bulge here. It came out a bit sloppy just because, you know, I had to move on. Yeah. So, yeah, this looks really great. Um, you know, the only thing here is that, uh, it's hard to tell how much of this is in the color versus in the normal. If some of the speckly stuff is from you doing stuff with a height map, um, and it's ending up in the normal channel, this may look, depending on how the lights get set up in Unity and everything, this may look pretty flickery when the character's moving around. And so the good news is that if it's in the normal map, we you in Unity, you can just sort of turn down the volume on that to a point where it's not as flickery. But the design look",

But like this going along the hat um I just kept it because I did think it looked um like it fit there. It adds more definition to the hat almost. But um other than that, no other real topology changes besides um smoothing out that face right there. And then as for the actual um armature and bones, if I can pull this up. Um, very simple. Um, they are a stubby character, so they don't have a lot going on here. Um, just like their head and then their torso and then their legs right there. >> Do you move the bones? >> The weight painting and everything else um was already like um pretty balanced. Like their head was like completely perfect. So, as you can see, we can like rotate this and make it go all these little different directions. Uh, the only issue I'm running into is, as you can see here, anytime I rotate their head a bit too much, um, the inside of their cloak becomes exposed because I did remove, um, like the intersection, like the intersecting bits. Um, not sure how I can fix that. Um, because I don't think I have a save for before I did that. So, um, if there's a solution to that, um, I would love to know, but for now, it just looks like there's a gaping hole in their cloak. But yeah, uh, that is the rig. Everything moves, um, as expected because they're a pretty simple little rig. So, nothing too crazy there. And I didn't run into any other issues besides um, been missing. >> Did you move? Okay, there's legs. >> Weight painting, so nothing gets distorted. Um because before their little like cloak here would um >> Okay. I mean it seems like we have enough movement to make that work. Grabbing this bone and moving even though you usually don't move bones down that would sort of you know not uh that might be one fix there. The hole is really standing out because you have the normal view on. When we look at the textured character, that'll just be like we may not even be able to see that in most instances, especially with the big hat on and camera being where it is. Um, okay.

Um, they are a stubby character, so they don't have a lot going on here. Um, just like their head and then their torso and then their legs right there. >> Do you move the bones? >> The weight painting and everything else um was already like um pretty balanced. Like their head was like completely perfect. So, as you can see, we can like rotate this and make it go all these little different directions. Uh, the only issue I'm running into is, as you can see here, anytime I rotate their head a bit too much, um, the inside of their cloak becomes exposed because I did remove, um, like the intersection, like the intersecting bits. Um, not sure how I can fix that. Um, because I don't think I have a save for before I did that. So, um, if there's a solution to that, um, I would love to know, but for now, it just looks like there's a gaping hole in their cloak. But yeah, uh, that is the rig. Everything moves, um, as expected because they're a pretty simple little rig. So, nothing too crazy there. And I didn't run into any other issues besides um, been missing. >> Did you move? Okay, there's legs. >> Weight painting, so nothing gets distorted. Um because before their little like cloak here would um >> Okay. I mean it seems like we have enough movement to make that work. Grabbing this bone and moving even though you usually don't move bones down that would sort of you know not uh that might be one fix there. The hole is really standing out because you have the normal view on. When we look at the textured character, that'll just be like we may not even be able to see that in most instances, especially with the big hat on and camera being where it is. Um, okay. It seems like you got just enough movement there to make to make that character work. Make it work.",

So for the character amateur, I use the Sing method. And for some reason, it always mess up with the hands. I always set it to that the character has three fingers, but it always two two like two bones here, but I guess it's okay. And then I also added this other bone here for his tail. The It's just enough for what I plan for how I plan to move the tail. Just go up, down, left, right. So, let's test out the character the forms where I move the bones. I think what best works here are the legs. This moving the body. I almost forgot that right now. Army has inverse magics after like moving him a lot. I have discover that it's better not to like very big movements on him. I think what performs the most here is the um the hands.

Um, this is him with all the bones and everything you put on. As you can see, if I rotate the different axes, his legs will move or, you know, the arm can bend back and forth or um up and down, things like that. So, I did use the mix bone structure. I I had to adjust the bones just a little bit on certain um areas. They were a little bit off, but still all worked together and made sense to me. Um so after just kind of adjusting them and everything, I have different things like um the you know my neck, my head can move up and down or you know side to side, how that kind of works. Um different also like areas like this that's the point of um area like this can move I'm rotating now can move up and down. That's more of a connector I would say. Um but like things like this, these ones right here can move the hands up and down and you know front and back and everything like that. So it poses really well. Um and also like if I was to use it for walking, you know, it can move back and forth pretty well and a lot of the clothing kind of moves with it. Um the mix was pretty simple. I didn't have isues with too much >> the other add-on there that gives you controls for it which would be a big um >> mix and I did add from last week I did kind of add sort of a hand. It's hard kind of hard to see but you can kind of see it on there. Um I did I couldn't just tap out but I did add a um some sort of a hand on there just bit more of like an actual structure to it instead of it just being like all just a strict arm. I had like some kind of hand. I was thinking about messing with it a little bit more and just spending more time messing it. This week I just wanted to focus on getting the rigging done and making sure that was all good. Um yeah, it's okay. Again, using the add-on to get the controls will make the animation much much much more doable. This looks like there might be some internal geometry inside the head there. You keep referring to it as a lion. I don't know if it quite reads as lion yet. I guess in the painting if we make sure that we paint a mane around the face, that would read more like lion to me.

And that's working. I mean, it seems to be working. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. The default projection does seem to project in some weird things. >> I'm I'm excited to to see this little boy animated. Okay.

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 29, 2025 Tail Animation Setup Tutorial Okay. Um, okay. tails. One thing you could do here and so you have your pelvis here and that's after that you have this bone sort of controls all of this. So um you already have a bunch of subdivisions here. So this is something that um Alec or anybody else with a bone could do. Um one of the things we can do here is in Blender do some um constraints in order to make it um so that you wouldn't have specific control over the tail. You would just get a lot of secondary animation for the tail. So if you see what this looks like here, I'll try and do it for some of the parts. So there's you have a lot of parts here which will when it's done will make it look correct. But um and they are working. So that part's done. You've got it way painted correctly. But a series of um damped track which is going to be the point at essentially uh constraint and you essentially do um like decreasing uh amount of influence as you put these on the components of the tail. over here. If we look at that. So over here, we're not we're not going to do the last one. This one is going to point at that one like this. And so here here here damp track um armature tail 10 points at 11. Bring this down. kind of keep rough track of where I am. So, we'll say 0 2. Next one. Tail nine points at 10. A little bit less. Tail eight, you guessed it, points at nine. Your pattern recognition is pretty. >> I don't think I've seen door. What am I doing? That's like That's door like here. >> Seven points at eight and six points at seven. Okay. Um let's just go that far. We can continue this down. So now if I were to look at this, that should be enough to see an effect. Uh if I were to rotate this, we get that. See what's happening there? Right. So secondary animation sort of fake fake physics. In that case fake is spelled also with a ph. Um um the wiggliness is a matter of the decreasing um influence. Okay. So the if I were to bring this down more let's say at one less than that less than that less than that less than that um and now if I come back to here. You can only push it so far. But you know now this just again to be clear you really have to understand this like the this sort of complex relationship is in Blender and so it'll be there like now when you animate the run you can have the essentially you just rotate this bone and then the rest of you know the rest of the tail is just doing what it's Okay. So, the upside to this is that you get this wobbly motion. It's not totally physics- based. It's, you know, like again fake physics, but um it does look uh it's a really good example for secondary animation there in that uh or follow through kind of the same thing that you know this is causing that. So I would continue like just to be clear I would continue this down to maybe there or so right I'm just not doing it for time sake but the pattern remains the same decreasing numbers of influence it's important that they be low if it's way up you know like starting at 0 2 is a reasonable number and then go down from 0 two each step but if you have way up. It's not you won't see any of the wobbliness. Okay, so that's key. Your bones are already weighted, so that's good. And your um bones are in the correct direction. So, you don't need to change the axis. All of that is already good. It's just a matter of filling these in and understanding the order. The constraint goes here and the constraint on you know 10 is this is the relationship you need 10 points at 11. Okay. So you're going you're pointing at the next one away on the tail. And so I think it makes sense to start building this one bone away from the tip of the tail there. Right. So, Alec, you could do the same thing. Um, just take your bone, do some extrusions on it. Um, you know, in order to create more bones, weight those bones to your tail, and then you'll have a similar situation where you'll get some of that secondary animation. Now, because you don't have control over this, the um the way that the secondary animation transitions between animation states in Unity may not be exactly what you would want, but it will still fade like all of the other ones, all the other bone positions there. Does that make sense, Amy? Right. and other characters with tails. Maybe Mr. Peppermint gets a tail. I don't know. Like it seems like the game >> in the DLC. >> In the DLC. Yeah. Yeah. There some >> Yeah. It seems like the the tone of the game would shift substantially with that character design decision. Um so damped track this sort of cascading decreasing amount of damp tract allows that sort of fake um secondary animation. And so here, yeah, if you added like an another bone there, that could it's very minor detail. So anyways, you super cool, right? like this because this just you know sort of happens now at this point and will get baked down into and especially with your character where the tail is like a very prominent part of the design. I think this is worth it to set you know do all the setting up kind of thing that you know be great to have a Python script that sort of sets that up. Maybe that's something for the future, but um especially if you got lots of tail parts, but it's not that big of a time investment, but the rest of it seems to be working pretty well there. So, in terms of Yeah, Alec is on there. Yeah. Okay. So, he's hearing this. Good. Um Okay, there's that. Uh Zoe's",

    "title": "IK Controls Setup for Legs",
    "video_id": "170zB7fXATQ",
    "search_text": "AVC200 October 29, 2025 IK Controls Setup for Legs You've got to do that. I mean, I really, this is a real shot in the dark as to whether or not that was work. This is definitely not best practice. If it works in Unity, then I guess stick with it. But um just be aware that that's not typically how that's done. So that may be an issue um over here. Yeah, you're going to want IK at least for the legs here. And let's see our angle for what's happening here. may be tough with the legs but let's see if you know the miximo one of the advantages here is that you know the IK is just sort of done as part of that here but in this case are bones labeled yeah this looks good foot toe Okay. Given the structure of your leg, I'm going to put the IK controller on here and I think body two is your top one. And in this case, what is this bone? This bone is the toe. And so now if we were to grab the toe and move it I'm going to do one other thing here. Let's see. Maybe she's a bird now. Um, so our process here, let me step back. uh given what we have here and trying to make the least amount of dramatic changes is you know this bone is the one that gets the IK constraint this one becomes the controller um the only issue right and so this one becomes the IK this is for everybody who needs who didn't go the Mixmo route who needs to create some controls the only controls here that I think are really for people not initiated would be making sure that we have the IK controls for the legs and so the IK on here over here this becomes the controller the only thing is that the controller needs to be um split off in this case if you didn't already create it as a separate bone meaning that it just is no longer underneath this bone in the hierarchy in order for it to work correctly. So, step one, grab this bone in pose mode um and add the inverse kinematics. Step two, in your case, select the correct armature, which is body two, and then the bone, right? And so, which one is it pointing at? This one. Toe right. Toe right. And now back to edit, grab toe, right click, and split. Nothing will happen. But if you were to move it now, um, you would see that it's off. That's not going to be a problem because we'll come back here to pose. And so now if we grab the toe and we move it, the whole character is moving. Why is the whole character moving? Because the default, the extremely undesirable default in Blender is that it assumes the entire armature is an IK part of the IK chain, which is means like as soon as I move this, the entire character should uh freak out, which is not what we want. And so you got to come back here to the actual constraint um the bone with the constraint on it and control the chain length. Right? So again this is one of the instances where zero actually means all of like the entire thing is um part of the IK chain. And so you need to have it be less than all by specifying a number here. And I'll say two, which should mean this one and this one. Let's see. Two or three. Um, and so now if I grab the toe and move, not rotate. That's that I think needs to be deeper. So back here. Three. G. There we go. So now we're moving at the hip. What does four look like? Yeah. Okay. So now the issue of the knee uh obviously Yeah. And so the a stronger knee bend during the modeling and rig creation process would mean that when you go to do this, the knee bends the correct way. But uh we don't have that here. And so we need right this here is referred to as the goal. Goal. This uh what we're going to have the knee pointed at is going to be the pole. I don't think there's a sport where you yell that >> pole. >> Pole position is what people yell at F1 races, right? I don't know. I don't have enough money to go to an F1 race. So, let's be real. Um, so we need a pole. And so this, um, bones really only care about other bones. And so we need a thing for this to point at. Let's go back and make a bone to use as the pole. And so here, this one is already separated. Um, we don't need to worry about weighting this bone because it's not going to be it's just it's just a point in space that other bones are going to reference. So, shift D gives me another bone here which I can then probably rename to knee right pole. Knee right pull. There we go. And now coming back to pose, grabbing here with the constraint pole target. Um, here. And there it is. And Let's look at the angle there. Might have to flip that. And so now if we were to grab this and do something with it um here and G. Let's see. We need to move this so that our leg is facing the correct direction. I think our chain is one too long. What is this doing here? Let's come back here. I think maybe I dialed that uh constraint up too much. Yeah. So, the angle of the bones starting to give us some weird results here. What if we just go down to two? Yeah. So, fighting the constraint is going to be hours of work here. Let's take our own advice and not fix this. Um, we're going to delete that poll in edit mode. And we're going to come back to edit mode here and add knee bend and see if this helps our cause. So now that should give it a little bit more of the proper angle. Let's come back to pose mode. Set this up one more time. Where is the toe? And so this should still be split. We start to move it. And so now we have something that does what we want by default. Okay. So now we can bend our legs and let's look over here. And also let's see if the other direction works. So here the very top we grab this and move this down. Yeah. Is your top of your body like totally separate? I didn't notice that previously. Pelvis, hip. Where's the top part of the body? Oh, here. Okay. So this spine needs to be a child of the pelvis so that when the pelvis moves um the spine comes along but we're getting the right kind of compression. This will be a substantial amount of offbook work. And again, I would encourage you to give your character a shot in Miximo if you have not. Um, because you're going to need to delete, you know, the armatures, the extra armatures that you made. Um, let's see if we can make a pole that we don't need to change, but just sort of sits there and that would help keep the knee straight. So here again, shift D. There we go. Label this knee pole. And now back in this one in pose mode. In here. In here. in here. [Music] Yeah. Now the knee doesn't do weird things as we move this back and forth. And so this would stay put just to sort of keep the knee honest there. But again, uh before I would send this up to Miximo, I would join the hair in the panels al together. Uh because you had a good pose and you're in a biped here that's very bipedal should be much better results. But the IK main things with the IK are going to be assigning the chain length is a big one. So chain length usually one or two here that needs to be separated in order to use it as the controller. And then if the knee is going in all sorts of weird directions that over here back over here. So for instance let's come back to this one with the mix mo rigs. The thing that we were having an issue with before was that the by default the knee poles that are created automatically our children are linked to the feet. So over here in pose mode if I go and do this um it takes that along which uh especially for the run uh is not ideal. And so these two controllers here, if we looked at their constraints, they are not actually underneath something else in the hierarchy up here. This is the same for everybody. And so these constraints um we can delete. And so if I delete this one and delete this one, now animating the foot becomes um less hassle. We can stay away from this and we can animate the control of this here. Right? And so now we can start the process of you know for this run cycle keeping this here to keep our knee forward and now uh and R. There we go. And so this could be here. And then G R G R. There we go. Copy. Crl + C. Paste. There we go. There we go. Right. So that's our basic leg loop. Now our passing uh this is when we're coming forward. And so here the foot is not on the ground. No weight here. G. Maybe move this up a little bit. Remember, I have the automatic um key framing on here. So, that's good. Now, we need that circular motion. And so, here we need to get our foot on the ground. And so, G. And probably a little bit of this. If you want to add some toe roll here, you could, but I would want to adjust it. And so, here, grab this one. Maybe roll it back just slightly. Right. So, the controller does have this is called um heel heel peel. This circular one right here like a banana heel peel. And so that's up. And so now as we come down we can do that some more. Yeah. You Alex only has so much toe here. And then back here again, get that back to where it was. And so now, let's see. We may have gone too far there. Let's come back to our controller. Let's make sure that our knee pull. I don't want to key frame this. And so I'm just moving it forward so that the direction is clear at all times. There we go. So now it's giving us our roll over there. Is it the heal peel? It's doing something weird. Let's see. Because that's where we get that. I get rid of these just sort of a extreme amount. Let's look here. I got rid of those key frames. We're fine. So, I think you're just pushing the rig too far. Yeah, I think I was just moving it foot too far up into the body there. Getting some weird results, but we've got that happening. And over here with the controller display. So over here with the this is for everybody in animating. This may be useful over here in the data on the armature uh under viewport display there is the um above viewport display motion path. So this happens automatically in other pieces of software. I don't know why this is such a lift for Blender, but it is. In order to see this um which is actually the path of the foot, you need to tell Blender to calculate said thing. And so that's in the motion path here. And so um yeah, you say come over here and say calculate and that can give you and you decide to calculate again for real this time. Um, and then it shows you exactly what's going on there. And so what you want to see here is what we talked about before. Each of the legs should be doing something that looks somewhat related to, you know, like bike riding, right? Your leg is doing some sort of elliptical path here. If you're doing a walk, the bottom part of it ends up being a little bit flatter. And we get something like this when the leg is on the ground. But for a run, the leg is only on the ground for a, you know, a very, very brief amount of time. essentially jumping. And so each of those um that's super useful for being able to see that. And so again, that's not in the bone settings, it's in the armature data motion path. And then if you change something here, like this position. So we wanted to bring this back uh like so. Notice that. There we go. All right. That does update automatically. I feel like that didn't happen before, but now it's happening. So you can see exactly what's going on. and back to here. And but now we can just directly use the R here which is much more useful. And here let's look at this now. Try and get that toe down. And so I'll set just a rotation key frame here. And then as we come down like here, rotate this forward a little bit so that it looks like the toes down. And then make sure I get back over there so that we have something that loops. And in addition to that, if you're going to look at multiple run, if you're going to if you want to make it cyclic, you need to make sure that there's key frames at the beginning and key frames at the end. If you're not going to do that in Blender because it's going to get baked, you just want to look at one. It's much easier to just look at one, right? So, wherever the um loop ends, which is right here, the easiest way to go about this is just set this to that value. And now you'll be able to see it loop. There'll be a little bit of a hitch at the end, but you won't have to you won't What does this avoid doing? It avoids um having to go back then and if you were going to make this cyclic, what does it make cyclic? It makes the things between the first key frame and the last key frame cyclic. And so you would have the foot pattern repeating like the pattern of the foot in space would be repeating like this. But the pattern of that heel peel would be repeating like this. Everybody understand what's going on there? And so these would not line up. Um, and so in order to do that, you would need to make in order to correct for that, you would need to set a key frame here and set a key frame here if you wanted to extend it in Blender so that you could see it do multiple times. But like I said before, in order to avoid that, just set your project to this length so that we have that there. Okay. Uh we did tails, we did this. I told everybody to take off the parenting child, the child of constraints on this controller. We'll make this much much more usable.",

This will be a substantial amount of offbook work. And again, I would encourage you to give your character a shot in Miximo if you have not. Um, because you're going to need to delete, you know, the armatures, the extra armatures that you made. Um, let's see if we can make a pole that we don't need to change, but just sort of sits there and that would help keep the knee straight. So here again, shift D. There we go. Label this knee pole. And now back in this one in pose mode. In here. In here. in here. [Music] Yeah. Now the knee doesn't do weird things as we move this back and forth. And so this would stay put just to sort of keep the knee honest there. But again, uh before I would send this up to Miximo, I would join the hair in the panels al together. Uh because you had a good pose and you're in a biped here that's very bipedal should be much better results. But the IK main things with the IK are going to be assigning the chain length is a big one. So chain length usually one or two here that needs to be separated in order to use it as the controller. And then if the knee is going in all sorts of weird directions that over here back over here. So for instance let's come back to this one with the mix mo rigs. The thing that we were having an issue with before was that the by default the knee poles that are created automatically our children are linked to the feet. So over here in pose mode if I go and do this um it takes that along which uh especially for the run uh is not ideal. And so these two controllers here, if we looked at their constraints, they are not actually underneath something else in the hierarchy up here. This is the same for everybody. And so these constraints um we can delete. And so if I delete this one and delete this one, now animating the foot becomes um less hassle. We can stay away from this and we can animate the control of this here. Right? And so now we can start the process of you know for this run cycle keeping this here to keep our knee forward and now uh and R. There we go. And so this could be here. And then G R G R. There we go. Copy. Crl + C. Paste. There we go. There we go. Right. So that's our basic leg loop. Now our passing uh this is when we're coming forward. And so here the foot is not on the ground. No weight here. G. Maybe move this up a little bit. Remember, I have the automatic um key framing on here. So, that's good. Now, we need that circular motion. And so, here we need to get our foot on the ground. And so, G. And probably a little bit of this. If you want to add some toe roll here, you could, but I would want to adjust it. And so, here, grab this one. Maybe roll it back just slightly. Right. So, the controller does have this is called um heel heel peel. This circular one right here like a banana heel peel. And so that's up. And so now as we come down we can do that some more. Yeah. You Alex only has so much toe here. And then back here again, get that back to where it was. And so now, let's see. We may have gone too far there. Let's come back to our controller. Let's make sure that our knee pull. I don't want to key frame this. And so I'm just moving it forward so that the direction is clear at all times. There we go. So now it's giving us our roll over there. Is it the heal peel? It's doing something weird. Let's see. Because that's where we get that. I get rid of these just sort of a extreme amount. Let's look here. I got rid of those key frames. We're fine. So, I think you're just pushing the rig too far. Yeah, I think I was just moving it foot too far up into the body there. Getting some weird results, but we've got that happening. And over here with the controller display. So over here with the this is for everybody in animating. This may be useful over here in the data on the armature uh under viewport display there is the um above viewport display motion path. So this happens automatically in other pieces of software. I don't know why this is such a lift for Blender, but it is. In order to see this um which is actually the path of the foot, you need to tell Blender to calculate said thing. And so that's in the motion path here. And so um yeah, you say come over here and say calculate and that can give you and you decide to calculate again for real this time. Um, and then it shows you exactly what's going on there. And so what you want to see here is what we talked about before. Each of the legs should be doing something that looks somewhat related to, you know, like bike riding, right? Your leg is doing some sort of elliptical path here. If you're doing a walk, the bottom part of it ends up being a little bit flatter. And we get something like this when the leg is on the ground. But for a run, the leg is only on the ground for a, you know, a very, very brief amount of time. essentially jumping. And so each of those um that's super useful for being able to see that. And so again, that's not in the bone settings, it's in the armature data motion path. And then if you change something here, like this position. So we wanted to bring this back uh like so. Notice that. There we go. All right. That does update automatically. I feel like that didn't happen before, but now it's happening. So you can see exactly what's going on. and back to here. And but now we can just directly use the R here which is much more useful. And here let's look at this now. Try and get that toe down. And so I'll set just a rotation key frame here. And then as we come down like here, rotate this forward a little bit so that it looks like the toes down. And then make sure I get back over there so that we have something that loops. And in addition to that, if you're going to look at multiple run, if you're going to if you want to make it cyclic, you need to make sure that there's key frames at the beginning and key frames at the end. If you're not going to do that in Blender because it's going to get baked, you just want to look at one. It's much easier to just look at one, right? So, wherever the um loop ends, which is right here, the easiest way to go about this is just set this to that value. And now you'll be able to see it loop. There'll be a little bit of a hitch at the end, but you won't have to you won't What does this avoid doing? It avoids um having to go back then and if you were going to make this cyclic, what does it make cyclic? It makes the things between the first key frame and the last key frame cyclic. And so you would have the foot pattern repeating like the pattern of the foot in space would be repeating like this. But the pattern of that heel peel would be repeating like this. Everybody understand what's going on there? And so these would not line up. Um, and so in order to do that, you would need to make in order to correct for that, you would need to set a key frame here and set a key frame here if you wanted to extend it in Blender so that you could see it do multiple times. But like I said before, in order to avoid that, just set your project to this length so that we have that there. Okay. Uh we did tails, we did this. I told everybody to take off the parenting child, the child of constraints on this controller. We'll make this much much more usable.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 29, 2025 Animation Workflow and Constraints There we go. Okay. So, let's come back over to here and finish bringing this into Unity. We need one more animation here. And so, we're going to put a jump in here knowing that this is going to the jump is going to be a little bit different in that it is going to play from beginning to end, right? And so we want minimal amount of anticipation here in terms of like the bending of the knees, which obviously is not physically correct. You know, if you're going to jump, you need to bend your knees, but there's sort of a balance here between the animation and the responsiveness of the character. So, let's just do something fairly simple here for now using the same controllers that we've animated before. And we're going to come in. I'm gonna put this on. And the big thing that people get wrong here is that do not move the character up in the jump animation. Okay, we're going to we're going to take the feet off the ground, but we're not going to substantially move the pelvis and therefore the character into the sky. Right. the actual results of the jump. That is done with the character controller over Unity. That may be something that you can adjust in the game. Your character gets like a jump power up and so they can jump higher, right? And so in order to make all of that possible, you need to the actual uh you know project projectile nature into the sky is handled in Unity. Okay. And so this is a little bit less. You need to imagine a little bit more here when you're doing the jump in Blender. So, uh, we're here. Uh, let's get into just some sort of sky position. And so, I am going to move the hips up slightly from the correct controller here. Uh, like so. And then let's rotate a little bit forward. I'm going to go I think it works well to do sort of like a hurdle kind of situation with these. And so let's take one of them and perhaps rotate this a bit and take the other one and move this back and get this out. And let's get one foot here. Again, same if you want to have feet apart for the jump, which most of the time you're jumping, you're jumping. Could you have separate jumps for jumping straight up and jumping at an angle? Yes. But in order to again have something, let's keep the more minimal here. We'll look at another possibility. But there's that. Is this moving this? Yes. I'm going to delete this controller. Boom. And delete this one. And you know, by deleting those, you see, you know, you're like, \"Oh my god, what happened to my knees?\" Just take this and move it. Take this and move it forward so that your knees are pointed forward because it may the controller may move back a little bit and the other one may have moved There it is. Move these forward. So, our needs are forward. Maybe a little out there. And back here. Don't want those animated. Let's grab this. And we need to get back to the ground there. Let's make sure we start with our feet on the ground. Let's make sure our left hand gets back. Make sure that's all there. Here's our neck. sort of up and then back down. Okay. And then let's go ahead and scale this out a little bit. Maybe 30 40 frames. Again, adjustable later. And if we want to have some compression when we land, it might be a good idea to exaggerate that. And so I'm going to copy and paste this position there. But then in between here, move this down and uh maybe back a little bit. We might need to adjust the arms as well here. And so the arms come back to the position, but they want to be down as well. So both of these in here, here, and here. Move these down. Let's look at that. So, we got this set up. So, we're up. Let's keep it at 44 frames. So, again, here. And I might extend this section a little bit. So, again, grab those, scale them out a little bit, give ourselves a little bit here. I'm looking for the relative timing proportions. And maybe this gets straightened out a little bit here. Now, with the other ones, we took things and we slid them left or right to create that follow through. with the jump, you know, it's not something that's repeating in that same way. So, we have this happening for now. In terms of the timing, like here, instead of having everything hit at the same time, something to give you a little bit more variety here is like maybe move our leg key frames off here so we get some sort of movement there while we're in the air. And then our neck key frame, you know, just sort of now it's not one position, the next position. Everything's sort of moving while we're in the air there. And yeah, let's get that into the game. So, we have this. Let's go ahead and save as um robot jump. And good. And there we go. So just robot jump. Let's come back to here. Right. The big thing for everyone to write down. Delete child of constraint on knee pole. There's not enough room on one screen. Oh, I might clip that part out on the Monday lecture, which I usually don't do, just to make sure that we don't go ary there. Okay, we got our jump that's coming again. And I'm not I'm going up into the air a little bit, you know, just to get so that the legs aren't running into the ground. But I did not This is the thing that people get wrong. I did not propel the character into the air. Everybody clear on that one? Okay, good. Let's bring it over here. So, let's save. Let's come over to here to here.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 29, 2025 Unity Integration and Animation States Okay. And this is where we left off before where we have our character idling and running and but now when we jump it's just still playing the other animations. So we won't play the jump animation. So in here let's bring that in which is here here file export FBX selected objects. Make sure everything is selected. back over here. Let's import that. Make sure this looks right. Definitely slow, but like I said before, we can adjust that. Uh, let's rename it to jump. Let's apply that and let's get it on to into our system here. I bring in two things. Yeah, not that. Just this Uh let's just make sure that this looks correct. And I can just test it by itself by just saying um just automatically go here and uh delete that one for the time being. There we go. Just go to jump. Cool. Um, I'm going to have it as not looping right now. Let's keep that. Let's come back over here. Set that back to default. So, this is working. Um, and so now, uh, we want to be able to jump from both of these, and we need this, um, transition here. So, we will rightclick and make transition to here. Right click and make transition back. And let's just get that one going first. And now, whereas before we were using speed, now we're using our boolean to trigger this animation. And so in our logic here, instead of using this, we're using grounded is false in our case, right? Because it's true when we're touching the ground. And so that's good. And does not have exit time. That's off in this case. Here, uh, we need to go back when appropriate. And so grounded is true when we hit the ground. There we go. And turn off has exit time. Okay. And so now um both of these are set up. This is going to be our main our main places to adjust how long it takes to fade between each one. Um, and then the speed of the jump based on the height that we're jumping in this setting. Okay. So, balancing just like we're balancing the speed of the run with this number, you need to balance the speed of the jump animation with the with this number. So, now saving, hitting play. There we go. If we start moving around. Yeah. Okay. It's happening, but we don't get there fast enough at all. So, let's move this one so that we transition quicker by shrinking down that fade time there. And on the way back, this is also going to be probably a bit much. Bring that down. Okay, that's working. The jump speed is definitely the speed of the animation is too slow. So up here, let's see what 1.5 looks like. based on the amount of air time we're getting now with our numbers. Better. How about 1.8? I think you can update this while we're running. Let's see. How about 2.2? So something you may want to go back and adjust later is that down how much of that you want and how much of that um it may need to be extended on the timeline because you remember most of that is happening by default during this time right and so it gets changed there. Yes. jumper would be able to adjust that way. >> No, I mean when you touch the platform it would just start this sooner, you know, like you wouldn't be in the same part of the jump, but you would still fade between like in this case the legs apart to there. like the fading helps us here in a lot of situations. Uh like that and and then okay so that's working. The other situation that we want to adjust here is that you want to be able to jump from standing still as well. So we need to kind of make this like a pyramid and this needs to go back to here. And so from here, same logic. Um, there is false, there is true. I'm going fast, but I think everybody understands what's happening here. Yes. >> Okay. And make sure that has exit time is off on these. There we go. Uh, and so now even if I don't move, I should be able to jump. Why are we not seeing this animate? We should be seeing this light up unless I've turned off some setting that does that. this tag may be doing that. Um, if it's giving you this moving platform is not yet defined, you can just delete that um tag field for now. Let's see if that stops spamming that and perhaps that's interfering with this update. Let's see. I'll fix that. Yeah, we should see these light up as we go from each one. Um, >> yeah, maybe this is Maybe because that's not on. Let's see. Or this isn't selected. There we go. Okay. Okay. So, here we get a situation where um these this transition logic and this transition logic are essentially exactly the same. And so, we're getting some irregular results giving it to kind of like go into running when it's not running. So here we need like logically you understand all that like if two things are true at the same time how do you pick one and not the other there's no ideally we want just one of these to be true at a time and so here we can build in the similar kind of logic that we have here because you can have multiffactor things and so whatever settings you came up with here that worked you want to duplicate those here. So greater than nine and less than two or greater than 1.9. Is that what I said? Yeah. 1.9. And so over here we can add two things. If this and this then that and so greater than 1.9 and then coming back um also speed less than two. Now, we should not see that confusion when we're standing still, right? So, for as wonky as this can seem at times, like being able to actually see the visualization of what it's doing there. And if we move around here, so I'm running and jumping And that's looks like it's taking our path that we want. And if we're stopping, let me just make sure I got the logic right. Oh, no. If we land and we're running this, so this one's slightly different. We still want to be uh greater than whatever the threshold is, right? Because this means we're moving, but we hit the ground, go here. We're not moving and we hit the ground, go here. There we go. So now every time we're running, we're taking this way along the path. When we're standing still, we're just going back and forth between these two on the path. There we go. So once again from here uh going from idle to run um greater than this number may not be the same for you depending on how fast you set your character controller. You know if you with the character controller defaults this is probably a good starting point but then as we start to build the game you may adjust the character speed in which case you'll need to adjust this number. Um so greater than less than and then over here we have our double logic of greater than and in the air greater than and on the ground and then over here we have just going through the I'm in the air but I'm not you know moving horizontally and then here I'm hitting the ground and I'm also not moving. Does that make sense there? What's going on with the character? Yes. >> Do you have the separated out? >> No, it's just uh the Well, yeah, there is a separate one for vertical speed. Yeah, but um it's vertical velocity. So, it's slightly different number. Okay. So that's this is yeah we just have run jump and idle. What if we have walk run and jump slightly different going to run a little bit over time but I'll try to do it fast. So here. Okay.",

So here we need like logically you understand all that like if two things are true at the same time how do you pick one and not the other there's no ideally we want just one of these to be true at a time and so here we can build in the similar kind of logic that we have here because you can have multiffactor things and so whatever settings you came up with here that worked you want to duplicate those here. So greater than nine and less than two or greater than 1.9. Is that what I said? Yeah. 1.9. And so over here we can add two things. If this and this then that and so greater than 1.9 and then coming back um also speed less than two. Now, we should not see that confusion when we're standing still, right? So, for as wonky as this can seem at times, like being able to actually see the visualization of what it's doing there. And if we move around here, so I'm running and jumping And that's looks like it's taking our path that we want. And if we're stopping, let me just make sure I got the logic right. Oh, no. If we land and we're running this, so this one's slightly different. We still want to be uh greater than whatever the threshold is, right? Because this means we're moving, but we hit the ground, go here. We're not moving and we hit the ground, go here. There we go. So now every time we're running, we're taking this way along the path. When we're standing still, we're just going back and forth between these two on the path. There we go. So once again from here uh going from idle to run um greater than this number may not be the same for you depending on how fast you set your character controller. You know if you with the character controller defaults this is probably a good starting point but then as we start to build the game you may adjust the character speed in which case you'll need to adjust this number. Um so greater than less than and then over here we have our double logic of greater than and in the air greater than and on the ground and then over here we have just going through the I'm in the air but I'm not you know moving horizontally and then here I'm hitting the ground and I'm also not moving. Does that make sense there? What's going on with the character? Yes. >> Do you have the separated out? >> No, it's just uh the Well, yeah, there is a separate one for vertical speed. Yeah, but um it's vertical velocity. So, it's slightly different number. Okay. So that's this is yeah we just have run jump and idle. What if we have walk run and jump slightly different going to run a little bit over time but I'll try to do it fast. So here. Okay.",

Dragging the animation clip from here to here should always automatically create an animator. So that that is there. And now that's going. Okay. Slightly different structure here. when we want to go from walking to running and keep things synced, right? So, this comes back to the sync issue Alicia asked about on Monday, which becomes a bigger deal when we have both walk and run. So, here we're going to use a substructure within our met within the animator, a blend tree. Um and so we will right click actually let's get everything on the right click and say create blend tree. Okay, there we get this thing but let's um so this is like another layer within this system and if you double click on it now you're in inside another subset of things that can be referenced up here. Okay. So again, more complexity, an additional layer of abstraction, but um not too terrible. We come in here. We can This works similar, but a little bit different. We want our idle. Actually, we're going to select this here. And we can't drag stuff in. It's a little bit different. We've got to add a motion. And then here we should be able to drag in an idle. Add another one. And drag in our walk. Then add another one and drag in, you guessed it, the run. I didn't take the time to name those, but I think I've got them right. And so now this is a little bit more sophisticated blending, hence the name blend tree, uh, for what we're controlling here. But we want to still make the decisions based on how fast we're going, which is our speed. And so over here, we need to select our speed, which we do have up here already. Oh, no, I didn't create this. Um, I made a new one from scratch. So, I need to once again add a float, call it speed. Make sure I capitalize the S or none of it will work. And this one here, this default one, I don't need. There we go. All right. And so now that should receive the information. Let's just make sure it's receiving the information. It's not receiving the information because I need to tell the character controller to send information to it. And so over here to there. There we go. There we go. So my main nothing's happening character-wise yet. We'll get to that. But over here we are receiving said speed, which is what I needed to confirm. Again, avoiding the big bang. Trying to put it all together. Uh, great. And so now we want our blend tree to be the default for now so that we see what's going on with it. So now we're going over there. Um, now back into the blend tree over here. In the blend tree up here at the top, we should be able to select speed as our parameter that is able to be uh adjusted and then automate thresholds. We want that off so that we can pick some numbers. And so these numbers now are, you know, we want to be idling when we're at this speed, walking when we're at this speed. Remember this says walk. And then this is going to be run. And this, so this is the threshold at which the transitions happen. This is the speed at which the animations play. And so we'll just leave those as we for one for right now. Uh, good. This is a one D tree. And so now down here, if you Yeah, I don't know why the slider doesn't go further to test, but so let's just test over here. Um, good. All right, so this Let's select this. We should be able to see similar movement here for all of this stuff. And so now I think we're there. Let's look and see if we can adjust our thresholds. Something is not happening. We've got this set up. We are receiving speed. Our slide air here is changing. [Music] We are switching between our states. State is good. State is correct. Oh. Um, when I brought these in, I did not set the animation to loop. Apply. Apply. While we're here walk run apply okay and see now I think we should have some better results so each of them is set to loop each of them is named that's much more useful over here. Now here are we going into the blend tree? Yes, we are in blendree. Blend tree is there. That's in receiving speed information. We're using speed information. They're telling it to use a speed. These are, if anything, these are too low. We're in here. We're in the blend tree. Got this set. We got this set. We're sending information to the correct one.",

Yeah. So, come back to it. >> I I I I may have a request for him as well. >> All right. So, I guess we'll start with Jack and uh then just hold up class until Gavin gets back. Hey, this is Jack with ABC240 and we're going to take a look at the 180 degree rule uh video that we did for this week. Um so, yeah, here's the overhead diagram. Um it doesn't show all the cameras I have in the uh scene. I have one way back here for the wide shot. We put the camera over AJ's shoulder. We got the camera over Mr. Vegas's shoulder. Um the cutaway shots of the burger and the um medium close-up shot on Mr. Mr. Elvis, Mr. Vegas. Here is the actual video itself. It's pretty short. Sorry, man. I didn't realize. >> Seriously, dude, how did you not realize? >> I don't know. I was trying to get rid of it. You don't just throw away a good burger. Someone could have ate that. I could have ate that. Really? Fine. Fine. I guess I'm just overreacting. You think you are overreacting? Here is the actual uh scene right here. Pretty simple. And uh yeah, I I just had it render all change like render all like already edited, I suppose. and already, you know, in um in the layout that I wanted to have it. So, yeah, this is the over the shoulder shot. The other over the older over the shoulder shot. Um and yeah, tried to match the rule of thirds. It was a little weird because uh this guy had a huge hair and um collar, so it was like kind of like awkward to uh to frame him. Like I want to keep this out of frame because it was just like annoying. but then just end up having just like his face only in the shot. Um uh I think AJ's works a lot better um because he doesn't have a huge collar with the cutaway shot that's slowly um pulling out medium closeup and then yeah the wide shot pulling out. Yeah, it's supposed to be just a silly um uh a silly scene. And that's why it's just Yeah, it's short, but it's silly and dumb. I did try to do some compositing stuff um and make do the cryptomat thing, changing the saturation a little bit on the characters and also adding a slight bloom and a lens and lens distortion because can never go wrong with that. Um, and um, yeah, I was just trying to kind of match that like emotion of like, does this really matter? Like, it's just kind of like a silly um, just a silly argument or whatever. It's not even an argument. It's just like a conversation. Um, so yeah, that's everything. Um, and kind of I thought it was really smart to organize everything into collections. I really like doing that. And yeah, I think that's it. Thank you and goodbye. Cool. The So yeah, doing it this this way where we cut between the cameras in the same scene. Um, you know, the limit of that may be this kind of situation where, you know, now maybe the this shot or the other shot is kind of compromised because you're trying to keep everybody in the same spot for each thing both in real life production and in virtual production, right? the more if for a more flexible situation, you know, just rendering out this character shots, trying to frame this character as well as possible. That allows you to cheat this character this way and do the inverse on the other character shots so that you know they don't actually need to be in the same spots for the same shots, right? And that happens all the time in real life production for as much as they can move things around in person, you know, like, okay, now we're going to shoot the reverse shot over here, so you're going to need to step this way. And you know, it all works because they're just I mean, again, the whole point is to make the best image possible in the frame at the end of the day, right? the idea that like it all needs to be physically accurate or you know we can everybody cheats even in real life production and we can cheat way more because we're not constrained by things like physics or things running into each other or two objects being in the same time at the same place, right? You you can do whatever you want here and so uh you can you know just maximize all of that here. So yeah, the there's a give and take here between the editing quoteunquote in camera right here where we just be, you know, like all in the same scene versus rendering out the separate shots and then editing them together. And that allows you to, you know, maximize the visual maximize the visuals in every shot, right? And so you put bloom and lens distortion like just on the characters. >> The whole thing. Okay. Okay. But I just I didn't really look at the compositing flow. So that that was on the entire thing, but you just did the saturation for the characters. >> Okay. Cool.",

I think two for right here, which was a mistake on my part, but we'll show you the video. There's a slight voice. I think I probably should have changed some of the voices to make them seem more distinct, but I feel like you can kind of get the gist. So, here we go. Oh, wait. Um, one moment.

This is like the Simpsons reference. Like forget, you're here forever. Um let me show you. There was actually they were going to be in cubicles, but um yeah, I couldn't do that cuz the cameras would be kind of stuck. Yeah, this is a horrible setup I have here. This is not going to plant at all. I have a separate light just for this water cooler that you can barely see, which is a bummer. I have this random painting that makes it I feel like it's kind of like also I mean, if I was an office and this was like the only painting with these two, I would be really bummed out actually. I chose this for the cutaway because I thought it was very funny. You work at an office and this is what shows up whenever something's bad. Um, there was more sticky notes like lunch one day, Wi-Fi, this. Hi, Gage. Um, and other things like that. But yeah, this the Hi, buddy. The constitution. Yeah, there we go. But yeah, um I feel like I definitely work on those camera angles, especially like right here. I think she moves a lot. Like right here, she gets out of frame, which is fun.

I was going to do it with the papers but the papers said nonsense. So, um, from the cutaway I have Oh, hi. Um, for the cutaway I have, um, it's over here. I have two different cameras for this. I think two for right here, which was a mistake on my part, but we'll show you the video. There's a slight voice. I think I probably should have changed some of the voices to make them seem more distinct, but I feel like you can kind of get the gist. So, here we go. Oh, wait. Um, one moment. Is this like a severance thing? >> Is this like a severance thing? >> The TV show on. >> Sorry. Turn >> the You're here for >> on desk audio thingy. >> Are you seriously not done yet? >> Jeez. >> Well, I needed to shut it. I don't want excuses. We're on the brink of bankruptcy and you're twiddling your fingers. Okay. What did you say? I said, \"Congrats, idiot. You finally noticed.\" Seriously, what took you so long to notice you are running this company into the ground. >> Oh, I'm the problem. I'm not turning in things late like you. You're lazy and inconsiderate. >> Look, I'm lazy. Well, pardon [ __ ] >> Cut. Oh, are you serious? Sorry about that, Sean. [Music] All right. So, you got the cutaway to the computer screen. >> Yeah. No, this stack of paper. >> Yeah. >> Sorry. It makes me laugh. I'm not used to hearing my own voice. Um >> Um I just kind of wanted to go with like the office looking really bleak and sad. This is like the Simpsons reference. Like forget, you're here forever. Um let me show you. There was actually they were going to be in cubicles, but um yeah, I couldn't do that cuz the cameras would be kind of stuck. Yeah, this is a horrible setup I have here. This is not going to plant at all. I have a separate light just for this water cooler that you can barely see, which is a bummer. I have this random painting that makes it I feel like it's kind of like also I mean, if I was an office and this was like the only painting with these two, I would be really bummed out actually. I chose this for the cutaway because I thought it was very funny. You work at an office and this is what shows up whenever something's bad. Um, there was more sticky notes like lunch one day, Wi-Fi, this. Hi, Gage. Um, and other things like that. But yeah, this the Hi, buddy. The constitution. Yeah, there we go. But yeah, um I feel like I definitely work on those camera angles, especially like right here. I think she moves a lot. Like right here, she gets out of frame, which is fun. I did add a bit of shaking here a bit like earlier, but you can't see it too much cuz I I might have messed with it a bit afterwards. But um yeah, that should be everything. Thank you. >> Hi.

Um, and so then not only, you know, cheating the characters left and right, but you could like turn off this part of the cubicle so that you could put the camera over there or even if it's not a separate thing, you could just, you know, come in, you know, save the Blender file again or duplicate the object and just delete those faces or something like that, right? again so that you so that it's in the background here but then you can put the camera wherever you want over here. So that kind of stuff. Uh again just trying to you know don't try not to be too constrained there by you know this this system is the when you can make this work and everything in wide open situations then this is a quicker workflow.

I just had it with everything. >> If I turn that off, it looks solid, but it looked very >> Oh. Oh, like the like the water shader in the thing looked weird. Okay, I see. Cool.

And then if your actors are not roughly the same in terms of their delivery and their movement in between takes then um cutting between them editing between the two things becomes like really really really difficult.

Uh another So yeah, nice job working with the uh you know, we had the over the shoulder the OTS shots here. Um and they have depth of field. Usually what we see or we're just sort of conditioned to because of the camera lensing situation is that you know when we're dealing with depth of field most of the time when we push in we're going to have an even shallower depth of field because that's what would be usually required either remember there's one one main parameter for depth of field and that's going to be the f-stop Right? We've talked about that. However, that's not entirely true. The focal length also plays a role here, right? Uh a longer focal length gives you a shallower depth of field. And so on these shots where we are closeup or extreme close-up, um a lot of times these it's not moving the camera right in someone's face. The camera is some distance and it's has a longer lens than than a wide shot. And that's also going to result in a shallower depth of field. And also be aware of the other situation here in terms of you know this is IRL production influencing virtual production. So longer focal length also leads to uh shallower depth of field. The other issue here is that when we push so this is for close-up shots or medium close-up shots. The other thing is that when we push in close like that, especially like in an interior thing, um there would there's a chance it would be darker. And so one of the things that you could do to compensate for that in real life production is open the aperture. Again, we don't have to deal with that because the computer allows you to separate the depth of field simulation from the brightness of what's, you know, the amount of light that's coming into the camera lens or to the sensor here because it's all just calculated. But you can't do that in real life. And so you need to either, especially if you're not going to massively change the lighting in order to afford to not be really underexposed, you need to open the aperture, which also makes it a shallower depth of field. So both of those things contribute to those close-up shots usually being really, you know, like the background very fuzzy. Um, and so that was the one thing that caught my eye there is that when you had depth of field to get the back of the other person's head out of focus, which looked correct, but then when we would push in, some of those shots were like totally clear, which is just looks awkward um because because of these reasons, right? So, it's not, you know, quoteunquote technically wrong. It just doesn't look like we would expect it to look like if you're sort of tuned in to that here. So, you know, when I present it for the first time, I'm like f-stop, depth of field. That's only that's the main parameter, but there's other factors here. And for us, f-stop, you know, that's the slider. You're like, I want the background to be out of focus. F-stop. In real world production, it's like not only do I want to have a shallow depth of field, but also the the shot is too dark. F-stop open that gets more light into the camera and uh also creates this uh shallow depth of field. So in real life production where you can't mathematically separate these kind of things, it's a much tighter balancing act for all those things. Especially if you're outside where you can't just like make the whole scene brighter or make the whole scene darker, right? Then it just becomes a much a much more uh you know much tougher situation there. So like when we get closer to like this one, right? So there's like not a whole lot of noticeable depth of field in this even though we're closer to the character, right? And so if for something like this, I would expect the, you know, like certainly the TV or whatever this is to be pretty pretty soft there at that point. Um yeah, and like we wouldn't be able to make out any of this detail on the back and stuff like that. >> And then you put a little vignette in the um compositing. >> Cool. Yeah, that's a really I mean it was an astoundingly awkward mannequin character that they decided to throw in there. >> I mean, for my money, some sort of like really slow head turn when we cut to them would be weird. Any sort of like very slow head or eye movement always reads as like super weird and creepy because it's like I mean, we're at the end here, right? This is the finale, right?

Uh, and I'll start off by just letting it play out. And I hope you'll excuse the abominable voice acting. Thank you for attending this meeting, General. Is this about the object that we recently seized? I thought we had already decided on our course of action. No. And I've ensured that aside from those that initially discovered it, only we know of its existence. Well, I vote that we blow the thing up. It could give us a huge advantage over our opponents. Certainly not. That thing should remain in perpetual storage and waste such potential. It'll be so spectacular and bright. Why, I'll bet it could be seen for miles. And I say it's not worth the risk. What if it balloons out of control? It'll bring us so much attention. That's the last thing we need. Excuse me. As the one overseeing this meeting, I think I have a right to know.

Then we go to some close-up shots as each person expresses their more opinionated perspectives on the topic. than distant shots, uh, wider shots to communicate their, um, distant views on the subject. Uh, again, back to closeup because they're arguing more. And then a wide shot to show the third speaker and the other two. and then of course cut away to um the tube man in this photoggramometry looking room. As for the blend file, we have it here. And of course, as I said, 183 line is between those two. And uh you can see all the cameras and lights set up. Uh these models were not taken from Miximo. So I initially just decided to animate them on or just animate them without Miximo. I probably should have just removed the existing rig and replaced it so that I could mix it uh to give it the inverse kinematic controls. Um, >> so he he said they were mix models. >> They weren't. Okay. Although for the kind of bobbing head up and down animation, I did that by baking uh the sound waves for all of the dialogue to the F curves in Blender um for the rotation of their headphones to give it that bit. But as I said, I probably should have just stripped the original rig and replaced it with a mixo one so that I could use Miximo animations. >> Regardless though, that should be just about it. See you. >> Okay, great. Um, yeah, I was wondering if we were going to see this shot, right, where we really get a sense of the, you know, depth of what's the how far away they are from each other. Um, yeah. So, this is the situation where we've got uh it looks like maybe only these, you know, sort of effect lights that are here. I mean, I appreciate the fact that you have a much more um low-key lighting look here in that these are you we have these really really um bright uh edge lights or rim lights here on the characters and kind of obscures their faces.

That's at least just giving us some sort of visual information for all this stuff that's like really really um underexposed there. We're not really seeing much of anything there. Um, yeah.

Um maybe if that went on for a little bit longer, but uh and then when this happens, some sort of closeup on this person talking who sort of just shows up there. Yeah. So mostly our lighting situation here in that it's so dark we're not getting any kind of information there. again in quoteunquote in camera when you're rendering I would fill in the ambient light here with a bounce like so if you had turn this in if you turned on cycles it would be bouncing around the room more and this would all you would have some more visual information here but that's not going to be strategically possible because it's going to take forever to render this uh and so simulating your own bounce light here knowing that later. You know, it is much easier to make darker than to make brighter. Um, we can making something darker like this. Like let's say he added that ambient light there and it fills in some of this and then later he still wants it to be sort of high contrast but now we can use the levels adjustment to crush the dark tones here. Um whereas without that information being there then it's really there's nothing we can do in compositing to sort of bring this back at this point. Right? Because all of these pixels in here are essentially zero zero zero. And so even if we do run like a brightness filter on this, you're just multiplying zero by zero and getting zero. Um so yeah, you can't make something out of nothing in that regard. So the in general when you're doing this to give yourself more leeway later having things maybe more well lit and then you can make it contrastier later versus the other way around uh which is doesn't really work quite as well. The other part of this is you know going to an image sequence not in an MP4. so that we have more bit depth. I guess we should talk about this next week and render out to a better format.

It looks like a It's a blown out window, but then, you know, like that kind of gives it away. Um, as like a pull down screen, and so it doesn't really work as a pull down screen, but it does work as like a blown out window kind of. You know, if it's a blown out window, then all of this then the lighting seems really wrong at that point, quite frankly. Like the whole room would be much more illuminated. So if you want to make that look like a projector screen there, the simplest answer is to just put a movie on the emission channel of the material that's on here. That's the shortest route to that. There's other things you could do to run that to an area light which end up getting more complicated, but that would give it that would have it read more as projector and not um window in that case. Cool. And yeah, clever idea, right? That's like the lowest hanging fruit in terms of mouth animation is we take the waveforms and run it directly either to like you know the size of the mouth or in this time this case run it to the rotation for the head. Um most of the time that ends up being way too much information in terms of the um amplitude of the waveform.

I wanted to reuse these characters from a render I did a while ago because I liked the vibe they had going on and I wanted to do more with it. And this week I watched another movie. Always with the movies. Get a job. I know. I know. I know. But I did watch this this week and I found out almost the entire thing is two people. >> Do you have a job? >> Sitting at a table and talking about the thing between them. So, I thought that was a nice coincidence. And I used this as like a visual inspiration for my set. And that's all I got really. That's >> This looks great. Are these the Mixmo animations? And did you process them in any way? They just look way like the whole vibe kind of gives me like marionette, you know, puppetish sort of, you know, between like the way their face like the the style of the movement, but that's just straight out of Miximo. >> Okay. Did you speed it up or slow it down at all or >> I don't think so. >> Okay. No, I mean it really works. Super. Yeah. >> Here's my set. >> I mean, that's got a real vibe to it. >> So, I mean, did you start with this scene? again or just sort of copy and pasting people over to the other one. >> Yeah. Like the longer table here, I mean the shorter table here makes it easier to sort of frame everything, right, and put it all together. But I mean, yeah, this is a real vibe to it. We've got the volume in there. Yeah. Um, yeah. It was just just something about the speed that they're moving. And then I guess like the Miximo rigging having these giant shoulder blades as moving like they are. But and then does she have eyes in the back of her head or what? Okay. Yeah, it looks fantastic. I mean, a lot of it is like the really great like production design here in terms of like staging everything. You know, this one was like one of the definitely the most memorable renders here. And so this I mean the vibe strikes me as like slightly different than that one, but still really good. I mean I think it's just a matter of the video ending. You wouldn't want to you'd want to cut before the camera stops moving in this shot, you know, to the next shot. But overall, and most of you have been doing the thing like Alex did here, where you got a larger character talking to a smaller character or someone seated talking to someone standing and so sort of angling the camera in the both directions, which helps communicate whatever the, you know, power situation is between the characters there. And then is this separate lights here? >> Are those the only lights in the scene or >> Okay. Oh, over here. Yeah. I mean, it looks fantastic. I'm just sort of like there's something that's like I don't know. It's like the the sha like I would expect this to be more shadows cast on the floor or something. But it really looks fantastic. Like it has a real like awesome vibe to it. Um, especially, you know, the music really goes with the the way the, you know, the Mixmo animations worked out with those characters. Did you pick that after the fact or was that part of like the process? >> I picked it after, but >> yeah, I mean, I think that works uh, great.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 29, 2025 Student Feedback: Art Gallery Scene >> Hey everybody, this is my week eight scene. As you can see, I follow the 180 rule. I basically made an art gallery and I have an old man taking care of it. He might be the owner. He might be working there. And then I have a strangely costume vandal that is causing trouble. I added sound. Of course I added sound. That's my major game audio. I tried to make the um red appear in certain places, including behind the pig. There's an abstract painting. It looks like blood. And I made my vandal over here. Um since he's dressed in white, I put a white, mostly white painting behind him. So, I guess that explains all my artistic decisions. The pig is on a a tiger rug. Just thought the contrast would be funny. The lighting, I tried to make it a little bit dark so that it would make sense that the elderly gentleman couldn't figure out who was in the room, why the alarm was sounding, but I didn't make it so dark that you can't see the characters. It's kind of a fine line. So, that explains it. It was not an easy assignment. The software doesn't really cooperate. It's not intuitive. Seems easy in the instructions, but something always goes wrong. Something always gets stuck or, you know, I get stuck. So, you didn't enjoy this assignment in that aspect, but I enjoyed the creative part of it. That's it. Thank you. >> Yeah. I mean, that's really hard part of it. I got totally stumped this morning in class. It happens. Um, so the the thing I the thing I would ask you to do here is like like try to put together a version of this without this big animated camera move like yes you follow the 180 degree here in that everything does stay on this side but the you know like what again why why is why is that a rule? between shots. >> Why? What stays consistent if you follow the 180 degree rule? >> Yeah. The side and and and one more step, we want to keep the same people on the same side of the frame in order to >> know what's know what's happening like who's talking, where they are, who they're talking to, right? like so that there's some sort of sense of spa the audience understands a sense of space. Right? So that's that's the first principle is that not to not to disorient the audience uh unintentionally. Right? There's plenty of times in cinema where they do things and break this rule um so that they do create a sense of disorientation. But um you want to have you want to know you're doing that, right? And not just half-hazardly do it. And so I I mean I might try one here to just try and you know more do the you know the boring TV thing first and sort of get that under your under your belt there and then try to do something a little bit more um stylized with the camera movement. And then in g in in general I just encourage everybody to do we'll do you know look at all the camera movement stuff next week but just encourage everybody to be um conservative with the camera movement because that's the one thing another situation where you know like the student films are you know like there's not a whole lot of moving camera shots because it takes a ton of time to set all the junk up. Uh, and you gotta and if you're shooting somewhere else, you also have to transport it to set location, right? Um, and so until the future where we get the, you know, we can use the drone cameras for everything. You can just sort of draw dial them on. Um, I mean, which is kind of here, but like >> years later, >> what's that? >> I haven't Wait, which is that the most recent one or is that Yeah. Okay. >> Oh. Oh, like in the production they did that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like the um but even for like in indoor things or like the camera tracking and stuff or you know like where >> it's just very us very easy for us to move the camera where you know is I wish you know I could set up the software. It's like, you know, if you want to move the camera this much, you need to do 45 push-ups in a row, right? As a like a like a barrier that would you make people think twice about doing making that artistic decision, which is essentially the equivalent that they have to do next door where it's like, you want to do this? Well, it's time to, you know, leverage all that CrossFit functional strength and drag this 200 pounds of gear from this place to this other place, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're the they're on the GCC CrossFit team. Um Yeah. And so like because I was with you up until the the camera movement there. And so the the thing Oh, so it's supposed to be like a She says it's like a joystick like a um I'm assuming like a surveillance cam. So, you might be able to sell that if if if you animated the rotation only like those, you know, scanning cams that we see in all the heist movies. Um, which is always kind of fun. I mean, I'm sure in some instances that's necessary, but you know, then if you know anything about cameras, you're like, why don't they just get a wider lens camera instead of having this motorized thing go back and forth, which always seems strange. Um, but the like and then maybe do something in the compositing, right? How does something read as like surveillance camera footage? >> Black and white. >> Sure. Yeah. Grainy, black and white. And there's a bunch of, you know, like they they're actually there's like really cool like compression stuff going on, at least in previous versions of that. um in order to get way more footage on a tape or way more footage um look who it is. Um you have to go back and listen to me giving you a bunch of crap up until this point in the class uh on the recorder. Um yeah, the the I mean because you definitely followed the rule that was really great. Um, the other thing that struck me as maybe a little strange here was the the lensing. These seemed like long lenses based on the based on the space that we had here. Cool. All right. It's a good start. And I mean, I think you're you're getting things smoothed out. And yeah, I mean, um, Blender's taken big steps forward in the last bunch of years, but, you know, one of the reasons it wasn't widely adopted before the last, you know, renaissance over the last five years was some of its organization and unintuitiveness. There's not, you know, one part of the contributing decision to switch the program over to Blender. Like I mean, do I still think Cinema 4D is like a much better setup logical program? Yes, definitely. But then you there's external factors, there's amount of people using it. Um, but then this is all this all the programs have their things and so there's no holy grail here in terms of like man this there's this other one that's really intuitive and I never get lost in it and there's never presents any problem like that that doesn't exist. Um, so, um, given the value proposition, I feel like there's lots of unintuitive stuff in Blender, but it's as good as some of the other, uh, at least as good as most of the other situations for most of the possible applications here. All right, Gavins, are we are we ready for this? >> Yeah.",

The side and and and one more step, we want to keep the same people on the same side of the frame in order to >> know what's know what's happening like who's talking, where they are, who they're talking to, right? like so that there's some sort of sense of spa the audience understands a sense of space. Right? So that's that's the first principle is that not to not to disorient the audience uh unintentionally. Right? There's plenty of times in cinema where they do things and break this rule um so that they do create a sense of disorientation. But um you want to have you want to know you're doing that, right? And not just half-hazardly do it. And so I I mean I might try one here to just try and you know more do the you know the boring TV thing first and sort of get that under your under your belt there and then try to do something a little bit more um stylized with the camera movement. And then in g in in general I just encourage everybody to do we'll do you know look at all the camera movement stuff next week but just encourage everybody to be um conservative with the camera movement because that's the one thing another situation where you know like the student films are you know like there's not a whole lot of moving camera shots because it takes a ton of time to set all the junk up. Uh, and you gotta and if you're shooting somewhere else, you also have to transport it to set location, right? Um, and so until the future where we get the, you know, we can use the drone cameras for everything. You can just sort of draw dial them on. Um, I mean, which is kind of here, but like >> years later, >> what's that? >> I haven't Wait, which is that the most recent one or is that Yeah. Okay. >> Oh. Oh, like in the production they did that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like the um but even for like in indoor things or like the camera tracking and stuff or you know like where >> it's just very us very easy for us to move the camera where you know is I wish you know I could set up the software. It's like, you know, if you want to move the camera this much, you need to do 45 push-ups in a row, right? As a like a like a barrier that would you make people think twice about doing making that artistic decision, which is essentially the equivalent that they have to do next door where it's like, you want to do this? Well, it's time to, you know, leverage all that CrossFit functional strength and drag this 200 pounds of gear from this place to this other place, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're the they're on the GCC CrossFit team. Um Yeah. And so like because I was with you up until the the camera movement there. And so the the thing Oh, so it's supposed to be like a She says it's like a joystick like a um I'm assuming like a surveillance cam. So, you might be able to sell that if if if you animated the rotation only like those, you know, scanning cams that we see in all the heist movies. Um, which is always kind of fun. I mean, I'm sure in some instances that's necessary, but you know, then if you know anything about cameras, you're like, why don't they just get a wider lens camera instead of having this motorized thing go back and forth, which always seems strange. Um, but the like and then maybe do something in the compositing, right? How does something read as like surveillance camera footage? >> Black and white. >> Sure. Yeah. Grainy, black and white. And there's a bunch of, you know, like they they're actually there's like really cool like compression stuff going on, at least in previous versions of that. um in order to get way more footage on a tape or way more footage um look who it is. Um you have to go back and listen to me giving you a bunch of crap up until this point in the class uh on the recorder. Um yeah, the the I mean because you definitely followed the rule that was really great. Um, the other thing that struck me as maybe a little strange here was the the lensing. These seemed like long lenses based on the based on the space that we had here. Cool. All right. It's a good start. And I mean, I think you're you're getting things smoothed out. And yeah, I mean, um, Blender's taken big steps forward in the last bunch of years, but, you know, one of the reasons it wasn't widely adopted before the last, you know, renaissance over the last five years was some of its organization and unintuitiveness. There's not, you know, one part of the contributing decision to switch the program over to Blender. Like I mean, do I still think Cinema 4D is like a much better setup logical program? Yes, definitely. But then you there's external factors, there's amount of people using it. Um, but then this is all this all the programs have their things and so there's no holy grail here in terms of like man this there's this other one that's really intuitive and I never get lost in it and there's never presents any problem like that that doesn't exist. Um, so, um, given the value proposition, I feel like there's lots of unintuitive stuff in Blender, but it's as good as some of the other, uh, at least as good as most of the other situations for most of the possible applications here. All right, Gavins, are we are we ready for this? >> Yeah."

I didn't have enough time, which sucks because I had a really good idea, but it's fine. Um, so the video will just be silent, but uh, here, let me just turn my my camera off so you can enjoy this here. Okay, full screen. All right, here's the video. >> You're being so much like your father. >> Do not compare me to my father. >> I didn't compare you. I said you were acting like >> you're exactly like your mother. Everything you complain about her, you're doing. You're suffocating Henry. >> First of all, I love my mother. She was a great mother. Repeating what you told. >> Secondly, how dare you compare my mothering to my mother. I might be like my father, but I am not like my mother. >> Slob. I made all the beds. >> Thought of having sex with you makes me want to peel my skin off. >> You'll never be happy in LA or anywhere. You'll think you found some better opposite guy than me. and in a few years you'll rebel against him because you need to have your voice, but you don't want a voice. You just want to have to [ __ ] complain about not having a voice. >> I'm never going to be able to look at that mouse and not hear Adam Driver again. >> So yeah, you know, no audio there. Um, so with this, uh, I knew I wanted to have >> Did you process the audio? >> Yeah, I know I did. like you like sped it up or something or >> um Well, I voice recorded it. >> That's you? >> Yeah. >> Oh, okay. >> That's me. >> I thought you said you I mean it kind of you kind of like the process. I mean, you kind of sound like Adam Driver now that I think about it, but >> Adam Okay. Well, what about the alien? >> Yeah. I mean, I knew I knew because I knew like who's in that with him. It's him and >> Giants. >> Okay. Um, but the >> Yeah, >> yeah, it sounds a lot like Adam Driver. >> I was actually a little surprised that it did kind of sound like him. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Pitched it down >> an argument of some sort. Uh, so I, you know, I went into Miximo. I chose >> I I thought you said you didn't voice record it at the beginning, right? And I was just >> that was just subtrauge >> they had and I just felt like the mouse character would be perfect for this. I thought it was just I don't know it was just it was just perfect. But um so you know I started with that um in class you know I made that pregnancy comment and I realized like I kind of want to include that in mine so I included that like that's a integral part of the story. Uh well here let me just here's the overhead scene. Uh here's the the line and then the you know the 180 degree line. The cameras are on this side and wide shot two over the shoulder shots and then the close-up here. And I look I broke the the rule kind of for the last shot with the wine glass. But I think it works. I mean, you can tell me if you don't think it works, but I don't think it's that >> survey says >> it works. >> Yeah, it didn't feel disorienting at all like in in the moment of the shot. The Here, I'll let me like >> bad like it's not that evil how I did it. I think I did it in a way that kind of makes sense. Um, yeah. Uh, I wanted to kind of use the cutaways to like show things about them like the pregnancy. Who know? I mean, you can kind of think about the pregnancy thing is like however you want. I mean, who's pregnant? You know, the mouse, her. Um, it could be >> there's a lot of questions. I mean, I hope you don't go on a violent about this for very longer, but I have some questions that we're just not >> another person involved. I don't know. I don't know. But these two are obviously not happy with each other. Uh, I mean, and then the room here. I I looked up some stuff online about how to make EV lighting interior look good. And so I, you know, I have like an area light coming over there to make it look like there's another room. Lot of blender kit stuff here. Um, yeah, I'm I'm actually really happy with how the room came together. I kind of I made it a lot of it myself here or at least put stuff together. Um, and we got all the different shots, you know. Uh, yeah, we I really This is my favorite shot. I'm so happy with how this And honestly, I love the wine shot, too. Um, I just love it all, really. Uh, I had a lot of fun making this one. So, you know what? I think you guys get to see this. I think you've earned it. this week. >> Okay, great. >> Yeah, the it feels like like a real space for sure. Um, and your you know, like the production design here in terms of like setting everything up in the scene worked really well. So, you've got a sunlight coming in through the windows or a spotlight. >> Yeah, sun. Yeah. And then a fill light in the other direction. >> Yeah. >> And like perhaps lights up here. >> Yeah. Those lights were mostly >> Yeah. I mean, I'm not I didn't download it. Okay. >> Yeah. The um Yeah, the sequence worked really well. The Yeah. So, the depth of field thing here. Uh we can look at the it'd be interesting to do a compare and contrast with the depth of field here or the depth of field in the compositing. But um the the main thing that stuck out to me is in that cutaway shot, the rack focus was just sort of like way too quick, right? Like that's again that's a thing in order to do that in real life. like there's a you have a whole separate person, not the camera operator who's not necessarily always um Yeah. And so you always have a situation like something like this, right? So, you know, you have your camera operator who may or may not be the director of photography, and then you have someone else, you know, who's not their only job, but another job is to turn this knob, which is the um not the depth of field, but the focus distance slider for us, right? And so that's always um you know, the speed at which you're doing that, right? So even if you're trying to do it very very mechanically, there's like the speed up and slow down to it, you know, like this easing and it's almost never a this kind of thing, right? Because you're you're going to like jostle the camera and everything else, right? Like it just makes it very difficult to to do that. There are like machines now that uh you can do to sort of like program uh you know this kind of thing mechanically, but you know that's not on every position everything. And so it's just it's always like uh even when it's quick it's usually a whereas yours like just yeah really really quick. And so that that was the only thing that really stuck out to me as kind of jarring there. But just being just knowing just I think seeing how this works in a lot of situations, right? Because the person holding the camera on any sort of substantial camera like this is a you know like a whole job in and of itself, right? This this is, you know, this is a modern quote unquote small camera, right? Like this was a whole big deal previously. And so, um, yeah, being able to turn this knob without messing up all of this stuff and still being able to This is why the reason they have this white ring here is right again, they don't get the object dropper like we do, right? And so the being precisely in focus is is difficult. And so they'll set up all the characters and say you're racking focus from, you know, that woman to the background. You know, they'll take a marker and they'll make a mark on the uh ring at, you know, that's where the woman's in focus and then they'll take a mark over here, right? Because you can't the camera operator can't be telling the focus puller to like more or less, you know, like while they're shooting, you know, like like and so you know, you got to make sure that everybody's there. People if the camera's moving, the people are moving. you know, there's a lot of a lot of variables there, right? So, it's like a it's always like a very delicate thing in a lot of situations unless unless it's some shot that also has CG in it, in which case it's being done afterwards and it's more like this situation here. So just uh again to just sort of having you know if you have a chance if you haven't made friends with or talk to anybody who's doing the film program I would encourage you to do so and like if you can like just um you know they always need help and just sort of showing up for a day to just do whatever like would help sort of if you're not going to take um 108 eight over there which is the beginning production class. it would help fill in a lot of gaps in terms of informing what we're doing here because everyone who designs the programs that all of this was designed to work like that, right? Um with, you know, the differences that I try to point out to to all you as we're doing it. But being able to being able to see and touch that um would be useful, right? Um, you know, whatever's going on. I haven't seen anyone train an animal to do that. That would be interesting. >> Oh, that's deep. Yeah, I think this might be like there now there's like some fancier things with like remotes. and stuff where yeah, like if the camera is up on a giant boom or something, you're like turning like still, right? I mean, this is kind of crazy, right? The idea that you would have this remote, so someone could remotely do this to a camera that's like not physically able to be accessed there. But this speaks to the degree to which you know a certain type of real world cinematographer is completely in a 100% devoted to the you know real life process of filming things that having a machine do the rack focus would be unacceptable. I'd rather set up a in this case ludicrous remote control system to make that happen rather than you know because here it's like we have this amazing remote control system that you can still get wrong right and so the the value that people are placing on the imperfections of the real world process you know I'm not saying you should also adopt those views I'm saying you should be aware that people with those views exist for a reason you know especially when it comes to film. I mean, this is, you know, I'm old enough to have seen when I was in graduate school seeing things go from film film to digital. Um, and some people still deciding to only shoot on 16 millimeter actual film and then digitize the 16 millimeter to edited, which you know because of maybe some very very very subtle differences in in the way that the film the chemical film is going to process everything. Um, yeah, this gives me like um I don't even know if I've seen the entire movie. The Ready Player One this because you know between her outfit and the mouse and everything else. >> This is the sequel to Ready Player One. >> Ready Player Two. It's a thing like they made a second one called Ready Player 2. >> The second one right now. >> Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. >> I knew it was a book first and then I mean that's a Spielberg movie, right? If I remember correctly. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Is the Have you read the book? >> I did. Yeah. >> Is the book better? >> It is. >> Okay. I mean, as is the case almost always >> at least like I mean movie. >> I guess I didn't actually listen to the audio. I listen to the >> Gage.",

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 29, 2025 Student Feedback: Egyptian Adventure Scene >> My name is Gage and here is my >> 80 degree shot rule project. First I have the video I'll play. There's a few things I want to discuss about why I chose the shots that I did. Uh, first of all, for this camera, I kept it uh dampened on the subject in the middle. And I also moved the camera back and out to the right over here to where the camera will eventually land on her shoulder to view to our first talking character. And then cut after she starts speaking. And then if you notice when it cuts back to this character I had uh put an animation on this camera after uh the focal point on the object. It's zoomed in more to show a little bit more emphasis on whatever this guy is saying over here. If we compare the shots, you can see how it's almost it feels like we're getting behind this character and almost looking straight at this character. I felt like that felt a little more intense and purposeful. And then we cut to this like realization shot and the lights start flashing indicating some sort of warning most likely with the subject on the table. And then this is my scene here. You see my cameras. It be easier to see them like this. I have all my cameras following the rule of being on their sides. It's hard to see with this in the way. Get our cameras all set up and using the markers down here. And that is it. What's your feedback for Gage? >> Okay. Right. Okay. So, I was waiting for him to say he was doing it intentionally or something, but I don't get that vibe after he didn't say it. Um, so yeah, the, you know, the cutaway shot, a lot of you, maybe everybody technically didn't follow that for the cutaway shot, but for the cutaway, most of the time it's a closeup on, you know, a thing. And so the fact that we're not seeing as much of the scene in the background, it's fine, right? Doesn't doesn't make everyone disoriented. But yeah, the whatever second or third one where we're this camera here, this one here, um, this one breaks the rule, right? And so, uh, yeah, I felt that when we saw it for the first time. So, here or there we go. Right. So, there to there. Okay. So this is the this is why we don't want to break the rule in that uh the police character is on the left side of the frame and by moving that camera over to the side of the other character we I'm driving the wrong one over here. Um you know now the other side of the frame and this character is over here right. So, I mean, did you guys feel that when you saw it the first time? A little bit. Something was a little weird there. Yeah. So, just a little bit disorienting. So, that's like you you Yeah, you were close, but I just want to make sure that you understand that that's what happened there, right? And so in order to this camera would need to come back, you know, probably over here and shoot kind of like in this direction for can't see my mouse at all. Uh over like thatish, right? Uh framing the nurse character or whatever that character is doing. Um, yeah. So, just just to be clear there, that that one broke the rule, right? And again, that's the reason so that the characters stay on the consistent on the same side of the frame so that the audience understands what's happening here. But super cool scene, right? Had like like this had a really really cool vibe. This monster could have benefited from that um noise uh on the bump channel to sort of uh you know looks like a monster that came from like a much more lower res video game um in there especially considering like how like the police officer definitely suffers from Yeah. What's that? He looks like Sonic. slime. >> Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got the miximo slime on him, you know, like where you don't >> um but it just gives him a lot of like, you know, specular reflection detail that then when, you know, we see the character I keep doing that on the other one. Uh, you know, it's a little bit a little bit less there. But um the staging of everything is cool besides the one camera there. And then yeah uh so what Gage did here for the realization shot is this is a um I used to do this earlier in the semester but then we really got sidetracked by doing it. So I guess we'll do it now. Uh this is a zali shot and so you it's com combination of zoom plus kind of uh dolly and so the camera is moving um in one direction and then or zooming in one direction and moving in the opposite direction. And so this this kind of shot uh really when you're doing this, there's two things. You want to keep the subject the same size in the frame. And then in this really will demonstrate the effect of focal length. We used to do this at the beginning, but because we used to look at focal length pretty early on, like it really sidetracked a lot of other stuff. So now that everyone's got a little bit more experience under uh experience this deep in the semester is that you know the idea is that we see the space either compress or expand around the character, right? So So Alex, what show do they use this in? with the show you mentioned earlier that I mentioned that you watched. >> Yes. Right. And so >> yeah, like trying to be I mean >> Guardians of the Galaxy. >> Yeah. Lot there's lots and lots of examples, >> but it's usually, you know, there to demonstrate some sort of massive change and realization with the character or the world around the character. And so the being in the elevator is important in severance, being as vague as I can. And so every time Adam Scott rides the elevator, it's this very slow zully shot that shows the space around him shifting. Um, so they use it there. And you know, one of the, you know, more famous examples is from Jaws when Ray Schneider sees the shark for the first time from the beach. There's a zali shot of the world shifting around, whatever his character's name is. I can't remember at the moment. Did anybody go see this in a theater? They re-released it this summer. It was this past summer, right? I think because it was like the 50th. Anyways, here it is. Yeah, right there. And so, you know, that's you when teachers across the country teach the dolly shot, everyone watches this sequence. Um yeah, so like he I think previously in the film not giving much credence to the shark attack uh reports that were coming in and then sees it happen firsthand and you know the whole world shifts around him. Um and yeah there's different almost always used for that kind of um that kind of moment and something in the narrative has shifted. Cool. So, good work pulling that off there. Um, but yeah, just get some deeper sense of clarity there with the with the rule as far as what's happening and where the camera should go. And there's Alec. We looked at Angie's and Alex.",
    "transcript_segment": ">> My name is Gage and here is my >> 80 degree shot rule project. First I have the video I'll play. There's a few things I want to discuss about why I chose the shots that I did. Uh, first of all, for this camera, I kept it uh dampened on the subject in the middle. And I also moved the camera back and out to the right over here to where the camera will eventually land on her shoulder to view to our first talking character. And then cut after she starts speaking. And then if you notice when it cuts back to this character I had uh put an animation on this camera after uh the focal point on the object. It's zoomed in more to show a little bit more emphasis on whatever this guy is saying over here. If we compare the shots, you can see how it's almost it feels like we're getting behind this character and almost looking straight at this character. I felt like that felt a little more intense and purposeful. And then we cut to this like realization shot and the lights start flashing indicating some sort of warning most likely with the subject on the table. And then this is my scene here. You see my cameras. It be easier to see them like this. I have all my cameras following the rule of being on their sides. It's hard to see with this in the way. Get our cameras all set up and using the markers down here. And that is it. What's your feedback for Gage? >> Okay. Right. Okay. So, I was waiting for him to say he was doing it intentionally or something, but I don't get that vibe after he didn't say it. Um, so yeah, the, you know, the cutaway shot, a lot of you, maybe everybody technically didn't follow that for the cutaway shot, but for the cutaway, most of the time it's a closeup on, you know, a thing. And so the fact that we're not seeing as much of the scene in the background, it's fine, right? Doesn't doesn't make everyone disoriented. But yeah, the whatever second or third one where we're this camera here, this one here, um, this one breaks the rule, right? And so, uh, yeah, I felt that when we saw it for the first time. So, here or there we go. Right. So, there to there. Okay. So this is the this is why we don't want to break the rule in that uh the police character is on the left side of the frame and by moving that camera over to the side of the other character we I'm driving the wrong one over here.

And the super job, Alec. Um, yeah. So, Alex fullon grease pencil stuff here. Um, and then, you know, Alec is also taking 200. You know, you pretty much got a cut scene for your game right here.

So, a lot of most of the cut scenes now are rendered, you know, in game, but um like I mean you can just insert this as the movie that plays uh at the beginning. >> For this part, I decided to go for a cell shadow look since I wanted to reuse model that I made for ABC 200 class because I think it looks really well in still shading style. I suggested this new model for this other character who still has who still doesn't have a name. But to make him I use some me I I use some mees from model. So about the >> And then what else?

I know that the letter effect may be a bit strong, but will make everything look like it's taking place outdoor, but honestly, I just really like how the glitters look. So, I think since you I just needed to maybe reduce a bit the glitter effect and also change the colors of the shadows and the light and the light in the in the mesh. As you can see here, here's how I have all the notes set up. I can easily come here and change the color of the shadows, you know, absolutely multiply, but it can be like mix or think also like to light less intense. Yeah, everything here is pretty adjustable. And if you wonder like how I get this, I get it from this video here. But as you can see, there is like a lot of other cell shading tutorials here that I probably try later. I also use the lip domate to make the characters more saturated than the background. And also, you know, to apply the effects only for the characters and for the animation. I used the step modifier so everything moved at 12 frame except from the camera and I think this worked really well for the cartoon style I was going for. It also helps since since the beginning I already plan to animate the mouth and the eyes. So with your pencil and animating on to reduce the number of frames I will needed to draw. I know that the the pencil animation isn't like the best. So setting up everything to took a lot of time and I had to rush that part a bit. And also as I mentioned on this part, I decided not to include outlines because the rendering time would have been more would have been longer and I also wanted I also wanted to add some sound was acting but unfortunately I I didn't have the time. Still I hope the final result is enjoyable to watch. >> Yeah, absolutely. really really well done. Um, yeah. So, the thing about the, you know, non-photorealistic shading, you know, there's all sorts of different ways you could put this together. This one, I mean, what you're doing for the characters, I think looks really good. The, you know, my only thing here from that standpoint is like, yeah, this lighting is primarily from the top. You know, maybe doing something more across the face uh would be just sort of define this beyond the like circular nature of the head in this direction. But um yeah, looks great. Really good using the stepped interpolation to make the whole scene work. And then this kind of thing like really strategically paced, super easy to do. um grease pencil lines really makes the scene sort of sit together as a as a whole there and using you know like what are probably like photoggramometry scans of uh different like Egyptian artifacts. This kind of uh feels like Uncharted meets Indiana Jones meets Bluey kind of situation here. Um yeah. What do you guys think? Any other comments for Alex? >> Yeah, it looks really great. >> Uh th this guy. And then I think again the the uh strategic double dipping of this is probably just the same model shaded differently or perhaps the earlier version before we made the ears. uh or the toughs of hair over here. Um so just reskinning uh something very similar makes that makes that work. I know I think it just this week you put like gloves on this one or something for the other class.

Uh Angie was saying that her camera was going for um like a video game feel. So, I'm not sure the moving camera achieved that either, but I saw a couple cool versions of this recently that um I thought were really interesting. So, in the camera, if I can remember where the setting was. Uh, Yeah. So, let me just make a I think it does some of this stuff. Um, there's like a builtin uh FPS camera in Blender. And so if you're trying to achieve that sort of video game-ish kind of look, um, yeah, it's up here under view uh, navigation. Let's do walk. And yeah, so now uh I can move around like I do using Wazda and yeah, like first person camera. And so uh that's what uh Angie was saying that she was trying to achieve here with hers. And so this is super cool. You can turn it on like this, but then you could combine this with um automatic key framing to um you know record this like first person you know FPS shooter view. And so if we turn that on, we make sure that we are in uh the walk navigation and then we hit spacebar. Yeah, the sequencing to get it to all happen at the same time. It's a little finicky. You want this on and then this on. Then this on and then over here. Oh, here. So yeah, camera to view. We need to look through the camera. Now we can turn it on. So we're key framing the right thing. We're key framing the camera. We are looking through the camera. And we are using the camera. There we go. And now I can move that around. And I just can't get back to the view. Okay, I think that worked just clicking on it instead of trying to hit the space bar. Space bar throws you in the other zone. So if we go back [Music] There we go. So depending on the the length of your shot, you know, starting the auto record, then coming up and then waiting for it to loop back around to move the camera the second time to write everything to the timeline just in terms of technically getting it done, but essentially motion capture for the camera. So using this controller, you know, it's like a first-person controller thing. It's like built directly in to what's going on there. So, for those of you already using the game engines, just using the regular game engine would probably take care of that.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 29, 2025 Dolly Zoom Tutorial Setup And let's just have something in the background here so we can see So I did more research on this versus this and this is this parameter is literally just a multiplier for this. So again this comes back to real world production where the units in which we're measuring light are calibrated for the film and for the sensors and all this is a whole other deal where here you know units are kind of like important but also kind of arbitrary right it's more the relationship between the things that matter and so anyways like this if you need to get bright fast this is doing that because it's multiplying the other value that you have there. The more important one is this one normalize and so normalize here allows which I think is checked by default now is doing this right so I'm able to change the light size which changes the hardness of the shadows which we talked about la uh Monday right um and the amount the brightness of the scene remains the same that's what's being normalized without this checked. Then when we make the light bigger, it gets brighter more as if it were this more or less what would happen in the real world if you like change the size of said light source would just be spewing more photons into the world. And so having that there to be able to control the shadows independently again not available in real world production but super valuable for us in this instant. Let's come back and look through this. Let's uh alt G alt R this camera [Music] and move this back. And let's rotate this so it's a little bit easier to handle. And we'll do something like this. All right. And so the whole idea here is that we are going to uh push in while zooming in the opposite direction. So we'll animate two things. First one will be the camera focal length and then the other one is going to be the camera position. In this case, what moving towards your subject? You know, for me, it's going to be on the Y axis here. And so, let's do that. Uh, we'll set these about where they need to be. So, we'll come back here to the um timeline and I'm going to set a key frame on the Y position here. And I'm also going to set a key frame on the to the camera. And I will move this in a little bit. Um, I'm going to adjust the camera a little bit here and here. And there we go. Okay. And so now, uh, I'll move forward in time. And set that key frame. And I want to maintain the same kind of framing. But first I will move this back. I might need to rotate a little bit on the here. We'll see. Um and then compensate here. So, I've got my focal length in my position. moving and zooming. So, the texture helps in terms of like we see more or less of the background. This isn't going that far. If we were to look at it from the top, looks like this. Let's see if we can get a more pronounced. Right. So we're moving and then the you know the wideness of the frustrum this area here is changing not that much yet. Let's change it more to the camera again. So from here and this will feel more like a change in space when there's more stuff in space here. So we'll put some more stuff in space like so. And let's try and keep the framing a little bit more consistent. So we have to animate the little bit of rotation here. I think I control Zed some of my focal length stuff from here to here. the more you move, the more dramatic the effect. And I'm getting the dip there either because I have too many key frames or because there's a key frame on the edge of this. Let's look. I just look at the rotation. Normalize. That looks good. How about the location? And so from here we might be able to make some other adjustments. So for instance, if this goes this way We got the basic ingredients for our zi shot. Moving in one direction, you know, zooming in the other direction. Big deal is going to be this one. Whatever it is, it's going to move you closer. And then this one, which is, you know, zooming in or zooming out around the character. I'm gonna make that again. This is not Let's try a different approach here. I'm just going to shift A and make a new camera and try and get this right about here. There we go. Okay, there we are. A little more extreme starting off point as our positions. And let's go ahead and make sure that this gets recorded. And there now is easier for just looking through the camera the whole time. Let's move back. while we're in view with our recording on. And then compensate here and turn that off.",

The more important one is this one normalize and so normalize here allows which I think is checked by default now is doing this right so I'm able to change the light size which changes the hardness of the shadows which we talked about la uh Monday right um and the amount the brightness of the scene remains the same that's what's being normalized without this checked. Then when we make the light bigger, it gets brighter more as if it were this more or less what would happen in the real world if you like change the size of said light source would just be spewing more photons into the world. And so having that there to be able to control the shadows independently again not available in real world production but super valuable for us in this instant. Let's come back and look through this. Let's uh alt G alt R this camera [Music] and move this back. And let's rotate this so it's a little bit easier to handle. And we'll do something like this. All right. And so the whole idea here is that we are going to uh push in while zooming in the opposite direction. So we'll animate two things. First one will be the camera focal length and then the other one is going to be the camera position. In this case, what moving towards your subject? You know, for me, it's going to be on the Y axis here. And so, let's do that. Uh, we'll set these about where they need to be. So, we'll come back here to the um timeline and I'm going to set a key frame on the Y position here. And I'm also going to set a key frame on the to the camera. And I will move this in a little bit. Um, I'm going to adjust the camera a little bit here and here. And there we go. Okay. And so now, uh, I'll move forward in time. And set that key frame. And I want to maintain the same kind of framing. But first I will move this back. I might need to rotate a little bit on the here. We'll see. Um and then compensate here. So, I've got my focal length in my position. moving and zooming. So, the texture helps in terms of like we see more or less of the background. This isn't going that far. If we were to look at it from the top, looks like this. Let's see if we can get a more pronounced. Right. So we're moving and then the you know the wideness of the frustrum this area here is changing not that much yet. Let's change it more to the camera again. So from here and this will feel more like a change in space when there's more stuff in space here. So we'll put some more stuff in space like so. And let's try and keep the framing a little bit more consistent. So we have to animate the little bit of rotation here. I think I control Zed some of my focal length stuff from here to here. the more you move, the more dramatic the effect. And I'm getting the dip there either because I have too many key frames or because there's a key frame on the edge of this. Let's look. I just look at the rotation. Normalize. That looks good. How about the location? And so from here we might be able to make some other adjustments. So for instance, if this goes this way We got the basic ingredients for our zi shot. Moving in one direction, you know, zooming in the other direction. Big deal is going to be this one. Whatever it is, it's going to move you closer. And then this one, which is, you know, zooming in or zooming out around the character. I'm gonna make that again. This is not Let's try a different approach here. I'm just going to shift A and make a new camera and try and get this right about here. There we go. Okay, there we are. A little more extreme starting off point as our positions. And let's go ahead and make sure that this gets recorded. And there now is easier for just looking through the camera the whole time. Let's move back. while we're in view with our recording on. And then compensate here and turn that off."

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 29, 2025 High Key vs Low Key Lighting So looking through the camera simpler path and if this were faster. So this is one where even though the camera is moving you you've got this complex thing a lot of times you know this again I would cut before I got on either side of this right so that I wouldn't see the camera sort of start or stop which is what happens in the Ray Schneider shot and lots of these shots but um and this can go either way right it's either like this where like maybe we're seeing more of the world around them some sort of realization Or it's something like this where, you know, space is getting compressed and things are caving in on them. You know, people do it both ways. Uh, and depending what's in, you know, you could even reverse it in edit. I mean, depending on what's happening in the background, um, have it flip back and forth like that. Does it make sense what's going on here? Right. And you know the reason I used to teach this at the beginning is that you know like this this makes it super super clear what's going on with depth of field when you see it or not depth of field focal length when you see it animated like this in terms of space getting compressed. Look through the camera if we were to look at at the top and hit play. That's much better animation. You'll see it's like fat at the beginning and then sort of making skinnier as it moves animates back there. But you can see how this would be, you know, not easy in real life, right? You have to have someone tuning the uh focus distance on the lens as well as like moving the camera substantially uh through space. So depending on what kind of like camera movement setup you have there. Okay. And let's make two different lighting setups for this. So here the other thing that we didn't talk about on Monday that I wanted to do here. So the phrase is the terminology is a little counterintuitive here. So highkey lighting uh a lot of situations where we have you know relatively bright well-lit scene where the character is you know by the general impression is that things are well illuminated. This is high key lighting and you can see a lot of what's going on here. That's a comparison. So this kind of thing um artistically flattens our image right beyond what's happening with focal length. It's just that there's not as much contrast happening here. And so everything's sort of, you know, big, bright, diffuse lighting. And the contrasting term here is, you guessed it, low-key lighting, which is going to be this very directional, very stylized um lighting where, you know, our character is not well lit. Things are falling off into digital blackness here. Just much more dramatic of an effect. The And so here, based on what we know now, does this look like a larger light source or a smaller light source? >> Yeah, smaller. Right. Like here when we want to have diffuse, you know, part of diffuse lighting is not only like the the size of the light, but then the size of light is bigger and that's also making the shadows softer. So we don't have this like very distinct um what's in shadow, what's not, right? There's no softness that's leaking into this area. It ends up being pretty um high contrast. So out of the projects that we were looking at today, right, Erands was maybe like the one where we definitely had um you know, where we had lowkey lighting. A lot of the other ones, the sort of like default, you know, you throw sunlight and a bunch of other lights in there, tends to be well lit, but kind of flat lit, you know, not quite highkey lighting, but more like that. Whereas something like this is a little bit more stylized. So, let's look at those ideas. I mean, a lot of what the highkey lighting is going to be is going to be a lot of the situations that we set up previously on Monday with our threepoint lighting studio. Let's start there actually. And let's bring in our friend And let's look at this primarily here. So, a lot to do with the face of the character in most cases. Let's do here. There we go. A little bit off center, but Let's move a little bit forward. There we go. Back to here. And so let's make the character sort of well lit so we don't see much of a falling off or gradation um across the body of this character. So we can take our setup here and go to our key and be able to adjust this over here. Let's turn off the other ones for now. And where's our Yeah, our target. Oh, I changed it away from an area. That's why even though it said area light, after you make an area light, you can come back and change it here. I changed it in the past. All right. There we go. Through the camera here. Dial this in so that we get some relatively even illumination on this side. Not quite as orange. And so now we want to fill in on the other side so we don't have quite as many, you know, even the darker areas here. still maintain a little bit of contrast, but you know, just make it flattening. That's what we're looking at in high key. And everything's so flat that even our backlight here doesn't do a whole lot. I mean depending on what the subject would be this or some of the other things um would depend how we want to have this set up but general highkey setup here. Everything's big diffused lights well lit not a lot of dark areas. So we got that. Let's save as this is key and then save as Loki. So here I'll grab my key light. Let's get rid of the back and fill. Just work with one. We'll bring the size way down here. And then just shift drag it up to really start to get, you know, immediately much more pronounced shadows here. How could I move the light itself? So that's the target. Come back to the light. Look through here. And here let's move it up and down. Come back over here. Make sure that we are in global. And now I can make a much more pronounced sort of look. Trying to definitely have half of the face drop off here into darkness on the other side. Let's see if this weren't in the way. Install that. And then let's use our other backlight here to sort of create still super contrasty but some sort of rim light here. So we'll come back to the backlight that's up at the top. Also punch this down to zero and slowly put it up. And then come over here and kind of want to define this edge of the character here. And let's look at this. Grab this and hit G. That's good. Maybe even less over there. All right. So, falling on the back shoulders there, like really trying to separate the thing from the background. Um, we might be also able to change the quality of the light by changing our position of this or proximity to the character. And so we're bringing this down and up to really create those highlights that are there while this is creating that on the other side. The problem is when we get this close here, we start to get a lot of weird shadows. Um, you know, this would not work in real life because the light would be in the shot at that point. Um, so, you know, there's that in terms of turning off the shadowing. Um, or there's um our light linking options. And so in the light it stuff uh object shading light linking. And we'd want to bring in the mesh of this object here. There we go. And so now that light is there to really, you know, create this effect and not we're getting all the shadows from our main directional light, but this is giving us that much more interesting sort of look. So over here, come back over to back. [Music] and so even in like errands right this is he sort of knew he was going for this to some extent and he had this part of it but a lot of the dimensionality of his characters here were obscured because we couldn't really you know see the silhouette of them in space, right? There's nothing sort of separating the characters from the background there, right? Essentially kind of like outlining your subject in light part of the function of the backlight. Remember when characters have hair, this is also sometimes called the hair light, right? Um, yeah, depending on how prominent the hair is. Looks like I just started searching for shampoo commercials here. But right, literally outlining the entire character subject there. Right. So, this like this is totally for an effect. There's probably none of the actual lighting in the scene coming from this light. The stuff that's falling on her uh face is probably a big soft box here that's offstage pointed in this direction, right? And then something else back here uh giving her entire silhouette definition here. So silhouette just like in fashion is super important here in terms of defining the shape of the character. two main important things like is the character actually positioned in a way that their silhouette is going to be discernible from the view of the camera and then two using the light to sort of outline the character in that um situation. This is a little bit more like we were talking about on Monday. They did it with these really really tinted, you know, like green and yellow or green and red. Here we were doing it with the orange and the blue to get uh these on either side. So over here, you know, this could be something where this backlight gets more into this territory and then our key light maybe gets more into that territory. And so now, you know, we get this much more stylized look. you know, the one that they're doing here. Now, we're outside of the color temperature realm and we're very lightly dipping our toes into tinting. You really every, you know, like they should change the interface here. So, it's really just this part of the circle because as soon as you get to the edges, it's just this is just looks really unnatural. It would be impossible to sort of create something almost this, you know, saturated. So, there's really hard light here, a softer light there. Obviously the materials play a big part in this but you know this is doing a lot to define the character against the background there um with the hair light. There's somebody with very big hair. A type of big hair. Make sense? Okay. So, a couple things this week. Let's um I mean build the studio setup from Monday and ask you to make you know two or three shots from Monday's lecture where we're just sort of putting everything together. Then um I want you to go back and pick three or four shots from this week's assignment to relight. Right? Don't rerender the entire thing. just render some stills you at least of one character and then the other character with all of this in mind. Yeah, let's we'll say four. We'll do four shots. So, do two of them highkey and two of them lowkey to really try and change the tone of what it is that you know the of your project depending on the the lighting there. So you'll have a whole scene set up and I would delete whatever lighting you had in the scene previously. Obviously duplicate the file and then delete your lighting and then you know start from scratch here without um each shot. Set up the lighting to make that shot look the best. Right? So, keep the camera where it is and then build the lighting around the framing of the camera to make that shot really, really work, right? Especially with the stuff like the backlight and the hair light in order to get the glint on your characters, you know, that's not something that's going to be able to be in the same place camera shot to camera shot to camera shot, right? So, you know, render each one separately and build the lighting for those shots.",

And then try to put together a ZI shot and we'll start the music video thing with picking music. I'm thinking somewhere between, you know, I could see a 15-second thing being a lot of work as well as a 30- secondond thing. So, let's say somewhere in that neighborhood of uh time because we're going to want to have, you know, somewhere between 10 and 30 shots in the music video sequence. So, I'll ask you to pick out the music so you have an idea of like what the idea and the vibe is like. You know, the thing nice thing about like music videos or perfume per perfume commercials, you know, they loosely narrative in that it doesn't necessarily need to have, you know, narrative causality in the same way that like a, you know, regular film would be. And I would not, the purpose of this is not to spend a whole bunch of time lip syncing to the music video, right? just building scenes based on all the cinematography skills that we've learned that vibe with the music video. For some of you, that may mean like there's miximo characters in it, dancing and stuff, but maybe not for everybody. That's not a requirement at all. Right? What I really want to do is, you know, I want to I want to see the production value in the final um product there that, you know, whatever it is, whether there's dancing characters in it or not, and that's not required, that it the quality of what we're seeing on camera in terms of the all the cinematic uh parameters is really evident there and fits, you know, the vibe of the music, right? The third and the seventh is essentially a music video, right? We have music going the whole time. There's not really any characters in that of any kind, but you know, the vibe really really fits the look and feel of what's going on there, right? So, a totally different sort of approach there as opposed to, you know, it doesn't need to be, you know, I mean, I'm sure someone is going to use the twerking animation in this project, right? I mean, it's going to be unavoidable. And I'll be I'll be shocked if we get through the whole thing without a without one one twerk. I mean, because we've had twerks in the other assignments that really didn't seem like they needed twerking, right? And we had LeBron James twerking on the hood of a car. Um, >> was that was >> it was not just Yeah. Yeah. I'm calling you out, but >> but you're all responsible in your own way. Um, >> I did not use mix. >> Oh, really? >> You did? Oh, okay. You you key framed the twerk. >> Okay. All right. Well, I mean, that's good practice. So, >> uh, great. Okay. So, music, uh, and along those lines, some reference for the music video, right? the reference. I think this these kind of student projects work well when you have two strong reference sources and you're like I want to take this aspect of this and that aspect of the other one and build you know use that as the vibe as opposed to I'm trying to recreate just the feel of this right so what is it about you know once you have more than do then it starts to become it it seems like people really get kind of lose focus of the aesthetic and so but having two things that you really really visually identify with and how are those going to influence what you're going to try and do here and everything is on the table right it can be NPR style or real you know uh more realistic or maybe I mean it's not that long of a sequence But I could see it possibly going back and forth between different styles, but probably not more than two, right? Like there's just not that long. So keep keep that in mind and you know, pick some sort of piece of music that you want to work with. And yeah, I'll try and figure out the thing so that we can hear it here and then uh but it's not going to cause a YouTube strike for our channel. Sound good? Yeah. Okay, cool.

And I would not, the purpose of this is not to spend a whole bunch of time lip syncing to the music video, right? just building scenes based on all the cinematography skills that we've learned that vibe with the music video. For some of you, that may mean like there's miximo characters in it, dancing and stuff, but maybe not for everybody. That's not a requirement at all. Right? What I really want to do is, you know, I want to I want to see the production value in the final um product there that, you know, whatever it is, whether there's dancing characters in it or not, and that's not required, that it the quality of what we're seeing on camera in terms of the all the cinematic uh parameters is really evident there and fits, you know, the vibe of the music, right? The third and the seventh is essentially a music video, right? We have music going the whole time. There's not really any characters in that of any kind, but you know, the vibe really really fits the look and feel of what's going on there, right? So, a totally different sort of approach there as opposed to, you know, it doesn't need to be, you know, I mean, I'm sure someone is going to use the twerking animation in this project, right? I mean, it's going to be unavoidable. And I'll be I'll be shocked if we get through the whole thing without a without one one twerk. I mean, because we've had twerks in the other assignments that really didn't seem like they needed twerking, right? And we had LeBron James twerking on the hood of a car. Um, >> was that was >> it was not just Yeah. Yeah. I'm calling you out, but >> but you're all responsible in your own way. Um, >> I did not use mix. >> Oh, really? >> You did? Oh, okay. You you key framed the twerk. >> Okay. All right. Well, I mean, that's good practice. So, >> uh, great. Okay. So, music, uh, and along those lines, some reference for the music video, right? the reference. I think this these kind of student projects work well when you have two strong reference sources and you're like I want to take this aspect of this and that aspect of the other one and build you know use that as the vibe as opposed to I'm trying to recreate just the feel of this right so what is it about you know once you have more than do then it starts to become it it seems like people really get kind of lose focus of the aesthetic and so but having two things that you really really visually identify with and how are those going to influence what you're going to try and do here and everything is on the table right it can be NPR style or real you know uh more realistic or maybe I mean it's not that long of a sequence But I could see it possibly going back and forth between different styles, but probably not more than two, right? Like there's just not that long. So keep keep that in mind and you know, pick some sort of piece of music that you want to work with. And yeah, I'll try and figure out the thing so that we can hear it here and then uh but it's not going to cause a YouTube strike for our channel. Sound good? Yeah. Okay, cool. All right, I think we're we're pretty good here. All right. And anything on the chat? No. Okay."

So that all that gets fused together there in the middle if I turn it up a bunch just to demonstrate the process. Right now if I move this back. Yeah. So it's pretty big there. Here now if I get just close enough. Boom. It fuses it together. That's way too small or way too big. That works. And we can do the same thing up here. And insert.

And so if we tab back out and come into the origins and if I were to move this, I can move this out. And then I can also grab um everything in edit mode. So I grab all of this stuff, leaving the origin where it is. And sort of moves that out. There we go. We got this hole in the middle. That's just a matter of coming in here and grabbing all these points in point mode. There we go. That looks better. Now, let's go ahead and bring these two together. So, I'm going to go ahead and control R. Control R. Control R. Control R. There we go. And now over here. Let's bring this in here. And here. Could insert both of these at the same time. And then delete the faces. and go into edge mode. Alt click, shift, altclick, right click, and bridge. Puts that together perfectly. Now for the other one, um, it sort of goes over the middle here. And so with that in mind, looks like I missed some of the points down here. Let's fix that. I thought I was in wireframe mode when I start got these points. There we go. That in. Yeah. getting them close enough so that they get zipped up by the mirror. Um I am going to put bisect and flip on so that that does now very cleanly put this together and yeah here we can do the same kind of thing. So let's look at this over here and controlr here right about there and controlr right about there. And then we may want these points going over the edge a little bit. Well, let's see how it goes. So, this is a little bit more complicated. I'm going to turn the mirror modifier off for a second. And sort of ex give this a little bit more of an extension. So, over here, for the time being, I'm going to fill this. Just press F. And I'll move this in a little bit. and move this in face. There we go. And so now if we look at it, it should be over our center point, which it is, which I think will make this a little bit easier. So now, same kind of thing. Um over here we should be able to insert these at the same time. Uh, delete face. Delete face. And then bridge these two. Cool. Now, if I turn this back on, we should be pretty good to go there. Um, so as long as I have bict and flip, depending, you may or may not need flip depending on what orientation you had the chair in to be start with. And so if we look at this now, this is fusing a lot of things together. Looks pretty good. Do I need to fill these holes? Uh, no. I wouldn't do it right now. Leave those as is. Um, may affect the beveling later, but This is before we apply the modifier. And so I'm going to call this chair half and save that. And I'll just uh control C. Let's go into object mode. And uh control C controlV. and turn that off to leave it, you know, get keep it as a history. Now I've got this. And so I want to apply the mirror modifier. And so let's do that there. And now if I look at this, I should have a line down the middle. We shouldn't have any internal geometry because we had that um bisect on. And we can look at that if we turn it on to X-ray here. And yeah, if I go inside very small, so it's going to be tough. Cool. Very clean. All quads. No unnecessary geometry, right? So, super super efficient. This is going to be um chair uh frame.

So, I'm going to go ahead and control R. Control R. Control R. Control R. There we go. And now over here. Let's bring this in here. And here. Could insert both of these at the same time. And then delete the faces. and go into edge mode. Alt click, shift, altclick, right click, and bridge. Puts that together perfectly. Now for the other one, um, it sort of goes over the middle here. And so with that in mind, looks like I missed some of the points down here. Let's fix that. I thought I was in wireframe mode when I start got these points. There we go. That in. Yeah. getting them close enough so that they get zipped up by the mirror. Um I am going to put bisect and flip on so that that does now very cleanly put this together and yeah here we can do the same kind of thing. So let's look at this over here and controlr here right about there and controlr right about there. And then we may want these points going over the edge a little bit. Well, let's see how it goes. So, this is a little bit more complicated. I'm going to turn the mirror modifier off for a second. And sort of ex give this a little bit more of an extension. So, over here, for the time being, I'm going to fill this. Just press F. And I'll move this in a little bit. and move this in face. There we go. And so now if we look at it, it should be over our center point, which it is, which I think will make this a little bit easier. So now, same kind of thing. Um over here we should be able to insert these at the same time. Uh, delete face. Delete face. And then bridge these two. Cool. Now, if I turn this back on, we should be pretty good to go there. Um, so as long as I have bict and flip, depending, you may or may not need flip depending on what orientation you had the chair in to be start with. And so if we look at this now, this is fusing a lot of things together. Looks pretty good. Do I need to fill these holes? Uh, no. I wouldn't do it right now. Leave those as is. Um, may affect the beveling later, but This is before we apply the modifier. And so I'm going to call this chair half and save that. And I'll just uh control C. Let's go into object mode. And uh control C controlV. and turn that off to leave it, you know, get keep it as a history. Now I've got this. And so I want to apply the mirror modifier. And so let's do that there. And now if I look at this, I should have a line down the middle. We shouldn't have any internal geometry because we had that um bisect on. And we can look at that if we turn it on to X-ray here. And yeah, if I go inside very small, so it's going to be tough. Cool. Very clean. All quads. No unnecessary geometry, right? So, super super efficient. This is going to be um chair uh frame. And let's do the seat now."

Okay, we got the basics of what we want here. Let's try and get this angle a little bit more representative. So, I can just go R. Try and get that parallel to our sketch like so. And that's pretty close. We can sort of dial in some of the other parts. Let's look down from the top up here. All right. So, it needs to come in towards this. Turn this back off. Back to here. Look at it from the top. And uh let's do that. I'm going to go to wireframe mode over to here to the edges or sorry points. And so now I can move this exactly to where I would want it.

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 27, 2025 Chair UV Unwrapping Process Now the size and placement of things over here is not super important. Let's double check and make sure. Yeah, before you start all this unwrapping and mapping and everything, double check again that your object scale is 111, or else it'll all be skewed and weird. Um, that's good. And so this up here tends to be kind of strange. Uh, so we cut that down. And, um, I'm going to go ahead and cut another seam here and here. And so let's come in here under edges. and uh select them here. Come over here and say oh we can only do that with this on. There we go. I forgot about that. Here and here. Right click and mark seam. There we go. See that? Cutting that seam there lets this top get way flatter. So that's good. Uh and now on the rest of the chair here, uh the general pattern is that we want to put we want to be able to cut off each of each of these rungs and then um let them be separate pieces. So, first let's get all the rungs. And so I should be able to uh altclick a lot of these loops. Cut off the other part. There we go. So those got separated. And now up here. Getting there with the live unwrap on. You can sort of see things getting better step by step. That's good. But each of these is essentially, you know, it's like a tube, right? So for all of them, we need to have some cut uh some seam rather along the length. And so where do you put the seam? Do you put it like on this inside edge or the back edge? You know, again, we'll be able to cover it up with triplaneer projection. Uh, I'm going to put it up in like the internal inside edge. So, here, this is one where the loop cut isn't going to work. You'll select here and then control shiftclick to get that whole line and then mark seam. And then yeah, you see that this immediately looks like this, right? Which is perfect. Like laid flat, these holes in it. Very little distortion on that. Same thing up here. And so let's click here. Control shift click there. Mark seam. There we go. We got two of them. Uh, okay. Good. now along this part over here. Let's do the same thing for these other rungs. And so I'm going to just altclick shift all click. Let's see. Can I get all eight of them? Shift altclick. Shift alt click. There we go. And mark seam. That's good. It's a big step forward. And now these edges. And so here, here. Oops. Again, every along the lengths of these rungs, you need to make sure you have a seam. Boom. See, immediately this is getting much better better here. Um, now our rung's down here. Let's alt click here. Shift altclick. Shift altclick. Whoops. And here much better. And now along the length. Let's see. Oh, these need seams. So here, here, and over here. There we go. And now these things. So, um, these are really the only ones with caps on the end. And so, no way around it. We need to um be able to cut those off. Uh so I'll put the flap where it's connected on the front like so. So uh click shift shift. And same thing over here. And then let's cut down the inside edge down here. So, three of the four sides. Let's keep it consistent so it can lay flat. So, it's the inside edge here. Click, click, click, and mark seam. And then we need something that goes along the entire inside length. So click control shiftclick the whole way up. Right click mark seam. That's a big step forward. And over here the other side. Trying to make this symmetrical. And again the inside. Click. And then control shiftclick. and mark seam. See, this is getting laid out more and more. Like this is an IKEA chair. Like all the IKEA things have uh most of them have these blueprints, which makes it great for this project. But, you know, it's starting to look like what that stuff looks like when you open the box and then start putting it together. Uhhuh. And now almost there. Right. So now looking at this, you can see a as we're with the live unwrap on where it's just continually re unwrapping. You can see order coming to the sections that we've unwrapped properly. Right. And where there where there's disorder clearly here, the front legs. And when we look over here, like yeah, that's like what is that? There's nothing that looks like a giant jagged spear in this chair. I don't know what is that. Uh, and so we need to unwrap these. I mean, could I just cut off the bottom things? I don't know, I guess. But, you know, maybe we staged the chair pushed over or something and so in this case, I won't those. And in this case, we might need to come in here to make sure actually those are we didn't fill that in at the top. And so we just need to we should just need to mark the inside seam here. And so control shift. This one's a little bit tricky because it does come in here. And so there we go. Mark seam. And then over here, boom. There we go. And so now if we come back over here, we, you know, you just sort of see it continually unwrapping itself over there. And yeah, it should make a lot of sense when you're looking at it, right? as if you made all this out of cardboard and you just have to cut. You literally folded these pieces around. Shouldn't be a bunch of weird distortion here. Looks good. See if we can adjust that. Well, let's repack once and see what happens. Actually, we'll grab everything now that's properly unrackcked and let's see if we can any of our unwrap methods change here. So, I'm going to say you and anglebased conformal. There we go. conformal gives us exactly what we don't get that strange and minimum stretch. Um, yeah, I can't Let's see if the documentation is a little more illuminating here. Yeah. So, here's the official word. Anglebased 2D representation, conformal, less accurate UV performs better on simpler objects. Okay, our object's pretty simple. Minimum stretch uses scalable locally injective mapping. Oh yes, of course. Slim. Yes. Uh tries to minimize distortion for both areas and triangles. Areas and angles. Let's see. Does that give us the same result here? If we went to that one. It's interesting that it angles this one, not that one. I think because of this edge. Does this one have an extra cut somewhere? Which one is this over here? Oh, yeah. Right here. You see how that one seam changes how it projects over there? Interesting. Um, and so that does not need to be a seam. Clear that seam. And then it makes everything perfectly straight over there. Wow. Interesting. Um, you there we go. A U. Yeah. And so now looks exceedingly good. Looks pretty well packed here, but we'll run the algorithm anyway. Uh let's do average island size which has been doing. Yeah. So again, it's trying to maximize pixel dexel density there. But especially in this case because we're going to make sort of two versions of this, like a nicel looking table and chairs and then like a banged up version from Substance Painter. Um, and so, uh, these are going to be like wood or have wood grain on them and having this, um, you know, makes that just more work. You can you can overcome it, but it's not um and so like is it worth that to ek out this tiny bit of extra space here? Probably not. Let's see if it does any I mean you can only get so good here, right? Like with if you don't want to rotate things and you don't want to distort them, there's, you know, like this is a whole people much much smarter than I have spent their entire lives trying to figure this kind of stuff out. Like there's all of these I've only recently gotten interested in this kind of stuff like uh packing math algorithms in terms of like how you know have we have we truly optimized how many golf balls you could fit in this trash can you know that physics allows or whatever and there's people like people working on all that kind of stuff. So, there's a limit to how good this can be here. And so, uh, in this pack islands here, I would say don't rotate, but feel free to scale and see if it get any better. I mean, I don't know. I guess that looks slightly better. I mean, it's tough to say. Um, the only thing here is that because we're going to unwrap it with the bevel here that's going to apply on the way out, I might give my islands a little more room to breathe. And so, let's come back and run it one more time. Um, and then bump this up maybe 0. Zero. Let's look at the 005. And now there's a little bit of extra space, which I think should make it easier to not have problems when we export this. And let's uh Yeah. So let's um save. Okay. Oh, and then um just while",

Which one is this over here? Oh, yeah. Right here. You see how that one seam changes how it projects over there? Interesting. Um, and so that does not need to be a seam. Clear that seam. And then it makes everything perfectly straight over there. Wow. Interesting. Um, you there we go. A U. Yeah. And so now looks exceedingly good. Looks pretty well packed here, but we'll run the algorithm anyway. Uh let's do average island size which has been doing. Yeah. So again, it's trying to maximize pixel dexel density there. But especially in this case because we're going to make sort of two versions of this, like a nicel looking table and chairs and then like a banged up version from Substance Painter. Um, and so, uh, these are going to be like wood or have wood grain on them and having this, um, you know, makes that just more work. You can you can overcome it, but it's not um and so like is it worth that to ek out this tiny bit of extra space here? Probably not. Let's see if it does any I mean you can only get so good here, right? Like with if you don't want to rotate things and you don't want to distort them, there's, you know, like this is a whole people much much smarter than I have spent their entire lives trying to figure this kind of stuff out. Like there's all of these I've only recently gotten interested in this kind of stuff like uh packing math algorithms in terms of like how you know have we have we truly optimized how many golf balls you could fit in this trash can you know that physics allows or whatever and there's people like people working on all that kind of stuff. So, there's a limit to how good this can be here. And so, uh, in this pack islands here, I would say don't rotate, but feel free to scale and see if it get any better. I mean, I don't know. I guess that looks slightly better. I mean, it's tough to say. Um, the only thing here is that because we're going to unwrap it with the bevel here that's going to apply on the way out, I might give my islands a little more room to breathe. And so, let's come back and run it one more time. Um, and then bump this up maybe 0. Zero. Let's look at the 005. And now there's a little bit of extra space, which I think should make it easier to not have problems when we export this. And let's uh Yeah. So let's um save. Okay. Oh, and then um just while"

Clearly, you know, we went through all this trouble to get everything nicely set up there, even with the tabs for these things. And so since this is all laid out, right? This thinking about how you I'm not a carpenter. I could not make this chair for real. Um but I mean I I do these kind of long lengths of wood usually have our grain going along that length, right? Um and it would also be consistent. So, for instance, with any of these wood textures, uh, if I were to bring this in here, just projecting it in UV right here, it's wrong. But if you look at it, it's wrong everywhere, which is exactly what you want kind of, right? In that it's going across here. All we have to do to correct this is simply rotate exact 90 degrees. Not changing the trip planer. I just rotated regular in regular UV projection. And now all of the grain runs along all of the pieces because they all are beautifully set out north south here like this in our UV map. And so now what was wrong everywhere is right everywhere. Right? We've got it all uh set out there. There may be some issues we want to address, right? So, we've got this here. Um, right? Because that goes around like that. Again, if we want to change projection for just one part of it, we would need to mask that out. But that's, you know, not not too bad here.

If you pick UV, you'd have to click twice. Um but now, you know, in this one, we could come back and try planer map this to uh get better control over how this goes around the edge there, I think.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, probably because I turned this down. That's why it's showing through. If I make it 100% and put it on replace now. Yes. Right. It doesn't do that. So, uh, how do I make it look less bumpy without doing this? So, yeah, this is the quickest solution, but not the solution in every instance. Right. The better solution is to add a levels to the height channel and bring down your input and output to properly attenuate that. Uh, can we copy this filter? Yes. Why didn't I think of that before?",

Uh that's going to be, you know, grain detail and uh just that on. And let's look for some noise. Maybe a little of this. And again, probably a 90 degree. There we go. We don't need very much of this. Just to add a little bit of extra detail here. So just trying to make it small. And then in this case probably can just mix in a tiny bit. So again that shift key allows me to just just get a little taste of some extra height there. And maybe want some of that in the roughness as well, but give it a different seed. There we go. And again in the roughness channel, salt to taste. Cool. So that gives the material a little bit more dimensionality there. There we go. Without with just a little bit extra thing on top and gives some tinier detail there. Um, cool. Now, uh, let's go ahead and save. Let's look at maybe some paint over top. Depending on what you'd want to, you know, like maybe there's a whole version like this that looks nice, but let's do a more weathered version. And so yeah, let's save",

And if you need to uh solve some technical problems by just simply removing them out of there, that's totally doable. Okay, awesome. I'll talk to everybody on Wednesday."

It's copy and paste even working this morning. All right. There we go. There we go. There we go. And there we go. Okay. So, just to again, let's do this or perhaps again for the first time, right? We modeled character. Uh, it needs to go out into Substance Painter for painting. We've done that. Um, here. And when we output from Substance Painter, we get we actually don't go to materials. Let's get rid of this one. Um, we want to actually have um textures, but some of you are already taking 185 right now or already taking 185 3D modeling class. And for that class, we use for every class we use Substance Painter, but you want to export from Substance Painter for the appropriate target, right? And so even though we're using Blender, we won't export with the Blender format. We'll export with the Unity. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. What render pipeline are we using in Unity? >> URP, right? Um, and so that's a little bit I mean it's slightly simpler now in that Unity essentially has two render pipelines. Um, and so then, uh, that will go onto a material in Unity. So, this comes in here onto a material. And we haven't exported our textures. We can do that after we get through everything today. Is really not that big a deal. Um and so over here this again is in Blender and when we stay in Blender over here uh we come up for the uh rigging. And so for some of you, this may involve a side step over into Miximo, which then comes back into Blender for animating. There we go. For some of you, you don't take that side step. You go directly to here. In Blender, when we're animating, we're actually going to have three different at least three different animations. And these all take the form of different FBX files. Export. And that's what we'll do today. We'll make an idle. We'll make a run. And we'll make a jump. And then these three come back into Unity here where we apply the material to the primary mesh. We add all the animations to the same game object. And then we uh use the animator to transition between animations or let's use the Unity appropriate terminology animation clips. Right? So this is correct. animator to go to switch between animation clips. This is really nice because it will essentially fade between any two clips, right? We've sort of we've used this in the bouncing ball that we clicked on in that we've sort of faded between two clips. The clips one being a bounce, the other one being a stop, right? But now something more complex where it's going to mix between all three of these based on the movement of the character. And we have our character controller CC, which is going to be our script that moves character. And this essentially communicates between the input, the character, and the animator. Handles all of those things. And so up here when we're designing our animations um like like we talked about at the very beginning of the semester the default is to loop right because we don't know um our character may sit there in a specific state and uh we want the animation to work if it just keeps repeating over and over again. Um and so we are going to uh set the idle and the run up to loop. The one that's not going to loop here is the jump, right? Because even if uh you just keep spamming the jump button, um it sort of plays from beginning to end uh coming back to the beginning. So no loop here. I think when you see it, it'll make a little bit more sense. And so let's keep that in mind here as we put the animations together. And yeah, these are going to be three separate files, but um really Unity does the part of like extracting the key frames, right? Because they're all animations that are on the exact same mesh with the exact same bones, with the exact same structure. And so you're able to just drag all of these into the same animator with relative uh relatively few issues. Although we'll see there's always issues and back here.",

Right, this is going to be what our character is doing when, you know, just sitting there. So depending on, you know, your character and their motivations, we just need to have something. Um, so we do not want the character to be perfectly still. Sort of breaks the whole, you know, reason you're pursuing animation, right? The Disney book is called the illusion of life and having your character freeze um sort of destroys this illusion of life, right? So we want to have something here um breathing hips moving so that there's a little bit of knee bending head movement optional. And we probably want to be at some point where we are What's the word I'm looking for? Displacing the waves. So here um this ends up looking like staggered key frames on the timeline. A lot of students when they start doing this, right, we have an idle here, we bend a little bit, we come back up and then they call it a day. So, it's just doing this the whole time. Yeah, you can see what an excellent mover I am as well. Um whereas uh that looks really unnatural because it's really you know unnatural to do that when we move um you know the different parts of the body sort of move at different rates right uh when we look at some of the mix mode stuff definitely comes from motion capture some of it is key framed but the when you look at motion capture data there's never like a one block of key frames another block of key frames another block of key frames is a bunch of things moving at different rates. And so we want to have that happening here. Okay. So I'm going to turn on automatic key framing and then uh get some hip movement here happening and we'll go from there. So let's come in here to pose mode so that that's where we need to be in order to set any of the key frames. Right? Edit mode is for adjusting the bones. Uh, but here we're good. And so let's grab this one. I'm gonna turn on automatic key framing. I'm gonna try and remember I have automatic key framing on, especially at the beginning. Um, the way Blender set up, I find this useful for like establishing my first set of key frames and then going from there. So, let's move uh this a little bit. I'm gonna start in orthographic mode here. Right. And so we have this down. Maybe rotate a little bit forward. Um, unfold over here. Come over to view and make sure I turn off only selected so that I can see all of the key frames here at the same time. Um, and let's disperse our feet a little bit. But I don't want that key frame. And I just want to change the default position here on these. And so I'm going to move one foot a little bit forward. I'm going to move the other foot a little bit back. Maybe rotate out a little bit to get things a little bit staggered. There we go. I can't brought mine back down from mix mode with the Y pose or the T pose and it had key frames on everything and we don't want to have that right now. So let's just delete all of those. And I set that one now. And I just have the control for the hips. So definitely delete all of those key frames there so that you have some way to manage what's going on here. Otherwise, the list will be too long. So we have our dispersed feet. We have this foot out to the side a little bit. I set mine here up with the IK arms, right? IK stands for what again? Inverse kinematics, right? Um, and let's get this. And so we're that essentially also gives us oneish thing to key frame here. Just this uh hand. And let's get this into position. Right. So, especially in Blender, I really like grabbing the orthographic views here. My one, three, seven, and nine. Like, so much so that now I need to make sure that whatever laptop I buy next has the extra numbum keys on there because it just makes the program like much much more useful. If you don't have um if that's not the case at home, just even using a external keyboard with your laptop, I think would make a lot of sense because it's just so much easier because this allows me to just uh you know, flip these and then jam the G and the R key. And I know that the G and the R are not going to um produce some excessively weird motion in 3D, right? Because it's con uh constrained to the u constrained to the orthographic view. And notice my key frame is not on here. And so let's just go ahead and make sure and put this in local so that when we click on things like this it makes it much much easier to for instance bring the fingers in because I'm in local mode right up here and you know my character is going to have their hands together here. Most of you don't have so many fingers to worry about. Let's get that one fixed before it stays on screen too long. That'll be the part that YouTube pulls out as the um thumbnail for this video. I'm sure. Again, notice not key framing this. Just getting the hands in some kind of position that they can stay in depending on how many. And this job is much easier when the gizmo is oriented correctly. There we go. Now I do want a key frame here for this hand. So, turn this back on. Nudge this slightly right there. Okay, that's good. And let's get our other hand kind of where we want [Music] There we go. Avoided that problem this time. So we can grab all of those at the same time. Just have to be careful that we get on to the correct axis here. And this one here for the elbow. Let's bring it in down a little bit. Let's save incremental. Right about there.",

So, let's go ahead and I'm going to want some The things I'm going to actually stagger here are going to be the hands moving up and down, the hips moving up and down, and maybe a little bit of head moving up and down. And so, we've got um hips, initial key frames for the hands, and let's get an initial key frame here for the head controller. Again these are uh going to be since I have IK this will be position position maybe some rotation position and rotation for the hips and then rotation for the head right not uh position for the head because that that's weird. And so let's rotate this up. Not that far. Right about there. Go. And so I want to get all of my players on the field here, here, here, here. That's a good start. Now, let's get our just basic loop points in there. Is that we want to have our start and then something else and then come back to uh the start point again. And so here we also want to be careful. I might take this. How long do we want our idle to be? Let's go 60 frames for right now to sort of constrain the amount of space. We might shorten this later, but this allows me to be zoomed in enough to tell if I'm accidentally setting key frames that are like one frame off from the other ones, which, you know, um is not our desirable situation here. Um we want to make sure that we're not doing that. And so let's go with those those four things for now. And so we'll have here and we will do another save incremental and actually I'm going to save as starting position so that when I do the other ones I don't need to redo the hands. If you don't have complicated hands, then this won't be um as necessary, but [Music] cool. All right. And so now let's go ahead and move down a little bit. I got my key frame, automatic key frame on rotate forward maybe just a touch on the same controller. And then let's bring my hands down a little bit. Look at them from here. I want to go straight down in this case, right? The gizmo makes that very difficult. Uh, and so switching to global, right? Really understanding that concept and being able to adjust those things when necessary makes it super useful. And coming over here to this view, grabbing this one. Let's look up just slightly. And turn this off for a second. There we go. And of course, we want this to be a loop. And so we can do our same sort of thing. RL Ctrl + V here as long as we grab all of the appropriate key frames. So here, let's look at this real quick. Um the if I unfold when I'm using the automatic uh key framer, it's doing the transform properties for these and Um, we've got location and rotation. And let's make sure we have location and rotation for each controller. What we want to avoid here are gaps like this, right? Uh because that's going to make it much more difficult to have control over the interpolation between different poses. Um, so for instance here in the hips, um, as I was doing this, so I nudged the position, but I didn't nudge the rotation here. Uh, so that there wasn't any, uh, rotation key frames. Make sure that this is on. And now there's rotation information there. If we look at this and then that's good. So that's complete one over here. If we look at this over here for my hand, this is my right hand. Want to make sure that in addition to this, I've got position and rotation on both of those. And then over here, let's look. My left hand has um position information and rotate rotation on the first one but not on the second one. And so let's just make sure that there's all of this here. Cool. Okay. Better. So, now that I know that all that's there, I can make sure it's going to make it a little bit easier to handle everything. Uh, now if I control C and Crl + V, I'll get a much more um precise. There won't be any information missing from these sets of key frames. And so this is what I was just talking",

Now, let's get our just basic loop points in there. Is that we want to have our start and then something else and then come back to uh the start point again. And so here we also want to be careful. I might take this. How long do we want our idle to be? Let's go 60 frames for right now to sort of constrain the amount of space. We might shorten this later, but this allows me to be zoomed in enough to tell if I'm accidentally setting key frames that are like one frame off from the other ones, which, you know, um is not our desirable situation here. Um we want to make sure that we're not doing that. And so let's go with those those four things for now. And so we'll have here and we will do another save incremental and actually I'm going to save as starting position so that when I do the other ones I don't need to redo the hands. If you don't have complicated hands, then this won't be um as necessary, but [Music] cool. All right. And so now let's go ahead and move down a little bit. I got my key frame, automatic key frame on rotate forward maybe just a touch on the same controller. And then let's bring my hands down a little bit. Look at them from here. I want to go straight down in this case, right? The gizmo makes that very difficult. Uh, and so switching to global, right? Really understanding that concept and being able to adjust those things when necessary makes it super useful. And coming over here to this view, grabbing this one. Let's look up just slightly. And turn this off for a second. There we go. And of course, we want this to be a loop. And so we can do our same sort of thing. RL Ctrl + V here as long as we grab all of the appropriate key frames. So here, let's look at this real quick. Um the if I unfold when I'm using the automatic uh key framer, it's doing the transform properties for these and Um, we've got location and rotation. And let's make sure we have location and rotation for each controller. What we want to avoid here are gaps like this, right? Uh because that's going to make it much more difficult to have control over the interpolation between different poses. Um, so for instance here in the hips, um, as I was doing this, so I nudged the position, but I didn't nudge the rotation here. Uh, so that there wasn't any, uh, rotation key frames. Make sure that this is on. And now there's rotation information there. If we look at this and then that's good. So that's complete one over here. If we look at this over here for my hand, this is my right hand. Want to make sure that in addition to this, I've got position and rotation on both of those. And then over here, let's look. My left hand has um position information and rotate rotation on the first one but not on the second one. And so let's just make sure that there's all of this here. Cool. Okay. Better. So, now that I know that all that's there, I can make sure it's going to make it a little bit easier to handle everything. Uh, now if I control C and Crl + V, I'll get a much more um precise. There won't be any information missing from these sets of key frames. And so this is what I was just talking"

So this is going to be two things. It allows us to offset and we able to see it loop smoothly here. You could see it loop smoothly. You could see it loop if you set the end of the project here and just goes back, but there's always a little bit of hitch. And so this allows it to loop much more, you know, reliably. And so you can see what's happening. Uh but now we can offset things. So for instance, we could take all of the hand key frames here for um our character. So I'll grab these. And now if I move them one way or another like this. So they'll sort of be delayed. Make sense as to why that's happening? Right. This is [Music] >> good because we're gonna we're going to um crop our export to here. But um the if you look at the actual wave here, if we come into our graph editor on our hand controller and we say normalize, which is so we can look at the view here and we were to look at this is that um make s right the thing make cyclic, if you don't know this already, is Blender's, you know, loop command. But the thing that's maybe counterintuitive or just not obvious here is that when we think of looping, we always think of it being after. But by default in Blender it is also before which is I mean I guess consistent depend especially discerning what we've already the way Blender uses um instances and things like that in that the copy goes both ways right and so the key frames start here but you see that the pattern has been projected back in time and it's been projected forward in time, right? And so, uh, when we export this, it'll make a key frame here so that, um, yeah, it's one of those really nice instances in which, um, we won't have to do a bunch of work to compensate for this. >> So, we just have to fill those gaps at the beginning and the end of the animation. >> No, this is filling the gap. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was just we don't have to worry about the ones in the middle. >> I'm not quite sure what you're saying. >> The animation is staggered. >> Uhhuh. >> Some objects are moving and others aren't. So the key frame there are gaps of the key frames. >> When we when we use the make cyclic command now everything's moving all the time. Nothing's not moving, right? Like so like like there's no there's no straight lines here besides, you know, the Z, which is there's just no motion there. But the um the bank cyclic means that it's going to that that pattern that continues after was just now projected before. So as if it's always doing that, right? Which is essentially what Unity is going to do because it'll just keep doing it all the time, right? And so this makes this um the our ability to to do this is very is great. Like this really uh works super well in that now we can really um use our fundamental principles of animation from our illusion of life book. Um, you know, this one is either, you know, there's a little bit of both. There's a little, you know, definitely overlap between the two PR principles and this is secondary, that's how you spell secondary, uh, animation and then also overlap or follow through. A little bit of both principles, right, happening here with the hands. Now, uh, we can take this further. The also notice that I took the hands and moved them back, right? So that it seemed like the hips were the ones leading the motion. It's kind of six of one, half dozen of the other depending on how far you would displace these things. But we wouldn't want to move this too far because then we start to, you know, like you go from the crest of one wave to the trough of the next and you start to disrupt the um illusion of causality, right? What what is what is leading what? If I move this further over past this, we would start to Yeah. Looks like a different loop cycle. [Music] and our neck here. Again, having this not line up. I'm grabbing all of these like so. Trying to be very judicious about my selecting. There we go. And move this over maybe just a couple frames. Just two. knees are pretty loaded right now. From the idol will be jumping and running. So depending on how you know dynamic of an athlete your protagonist is here, you may want to make a different decision there. But and here in the middle with the neck, I think I might What does that look like? And the other um so this does a lot to loosen up the body motion. Right? This is like 80% of starting to make it seem like a character, not a bunch of individual controllers, right? Um and a big part of that is displacing the waves. The other big part of it is the IK relationship between the feet and the hips so that we can actually compress between here and here. The feet stay put when we animate the hips. And that's a big part of just the fact that the feet have the IK controllers on them, right? And so that's pretty much absolutely necessary for any sort of bipedal character that's going to have this kind of motion. Um the next you know place where we can plus this is doing something to make sure that there's some sort of movement in the spine. Right? Again if you watch any of the um motion capture animation it's it's impossible to record any of that stuff without having you know like all of these very fine changes in the sort of body rotation of your core here. Right? You can't keep this. It looks very unnatural to try and freeze your entire core while everything's moving. And so we can add a little bit of twist here. And if we look at the top here, let's come back to the timeline view. Turn this on so we can set some new key frames. Can bring one more controller into the mix here. Perhaps remember these are going to be um rotation because they're just FK whereas this is going to be position and rotation position and rotation and the feet position and rotation. Uh so here let's go ahead and twist this a little bit. Maybe one down. Now I'm not in the orthographic view when I'm pressing R. And the reason there is that for these key frames will be very subtle and I'm sort of using the imprecision of the viewport R and G keys to my advantage here in that it is rotating it based on some rather arbitrary view that I have right now that's not perfectly aligned. If I'm perfectly aligned, it's going to and I'm using the automatic key framer. it's only going to set key frames that are perfectly aligned to that view, right? Whereas if we're not perfectly aligned, then we get key frames amongst all three um rotation uh values there parameters. And again, I want to make sure that I get start off with a clean loop. So again, doing the thing where I copy and paste the beginning to the end. these haven't had the cyclic treatment. And so since I've updated these since I want to do that um shift E, make cyclic. And so now here we go. But now I can fold these up, right? I fold them down in order to take inventory to make sure there's no gaps. And then I can fold them up for making more creative decisions so that there's just less stuff to think about here. Um, and so if these are again just slightly not aligned to the other ones, right, the whole body is loosened up a little bit. The other thing I might do here is like with this one in between the hip movement here, my hips do have position and rotation, but I mostly move them up and down. Again, in order to edit this key frame, I need to make sure that I put the playhead directly on that. If I'm off of that, I'm creating new key frames, which is going to be um in a lot of cases problematic. [Music] Okay, I like the quality of motion. Does feel too fast. Just to sort of look at it here. I grab it all. Sort of scale it out a little bit. Yeah, I think once we're looping, that's",

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 27, 2025 Exporting and Testing Idle Animation going to be all right here. So, let's go with that for now. Um, let's go ahead and save incremental and let's go ahead and export this um as our idle animation. Gavin lulled at something. I don't know what it was though. selected objects. Let's put it in there. Anything else for now? I don't think so. Oh, let's clip it to one loop. Okay. So, uh crop it to one loop. So, I'm going to use the hips. First of all, before I do this, I'm going to make sure everything has been made cyclic. Um, and I can inspect that by coming over to the graph editor. Um, hitting normalize. And this is, you know, exactly the chart I drew before. We have waves that are happening and they're offset. You know, the next step here would be adjusting some of these waves so they're not all sort of perfect um bezier interpolations here, but that's okay for now. Um so that's good. We see that the it's continuing, but you need to know I would use your hips as the sign here, right? So set the beginning at the first hip key frame, set the end at the last hip key frame. That's going to be beyond or in front of the other uh key frames there. So let's just look at the hips. And so that's going to be from just from here to here. And in terms of should I like I said, this is going to be adjustable later. Should you default on it being too short or too long? I would default on it being a touch too long. But you're going to be able to adjust the timing of this later once we get there, right? In terms of like how fast the idle is going. And so in our case, I just want to make my math easy. And so I'll move this back. And I'm going to scale this down uh till this is lined up exactly at 40 in my case. And then we'll make sure that this ends at 40 so that we have one loop there. Right? You could just work like this as long as you know that the you're going to get this like extra little blip uh when Blender restarts the animation there. It won't be as smooth as it will be when it gets looped in Unity. So, let's save it again and let's export one more time. Export the FBX over here. And did it duplicate or overwrite that one? Let's look. Overwrite. Good. Uh, good. Okay. So if we look over here, the difference, one of the main differences here is that we'll have a slightly more complex character controller, which is right here, character controller CC. And so if we hit play, the control the base level controls are the same. this thing goes around. There it goes. Um, so the this is the top, you know, conceptually this will continue to be the thing. The thing that you're moving around in the game is actually this capsule-shaped entity, right? And our player sort of exists um underneath it, right? And so if you were to bring this in now over here, the idol. There we go. If you look at this Let's make sure one other thing with Blender, we didn't see when I clicked on the import here. When I drag the FBX in, I didn't see my person over here, my robot, which is not We should see them over here. And the thing when you bring in the FBX, there's a bunch of stuff. And so if you unfold, you'll see a bunch of things here. And the uh animation clip that's over here, this is where we're coming in from Blender, right? So up until now we've been animating in Unity because we did a bouncing ball and opening doors and Unity editor is fine for doing some such animation right but you know when you start doing more complex stuff like this it makes sense to do the animation over there and so instead of creating the animation clip in Unity we are creating the animation clip and the animation clip gets saved onto the FBX when it comes in here. Uh, but we've got a couple of them. And so this is a Blender issue where we got multiple actions on the same thing. So let's just look at that real quick. Let's come here. Look at our action editor. And you can have multiple clips on the same thing here. We won't get to get rid of the other ones. This one is just an action. I'm going to name it idle just for the sake of clarity. And you see we switch to the other ones. There's no information there. I think they probably just got brought in from Miximo. So, let's get rid of those. Is that another way at >> Yeah, I I find it clunkier. We're going to stick to the thing where we'll keep each animation in its own file. But um yeah, just because this yeah either I don't thoroughly understand or this interface is not great. One or the two. Um, in terms of the setup there of managing the actions when they come over, we look at our Blender file actions, right? So, up here, usually this is in our view, right? So, right here. Um, but we can change this to Blender file. And so this exposes like what a Blender file really is. It's really just a bunch of data stored in this giant indexed um outline. And Blender will in a way that a lot of other problem programs don't show you all of that stuff right here. Right? A lot of like After Effects, the After Effects file, the A file, you can look at it as like a JSON or something. you can convert to JSON and it's just like a big indexed um database of the key frames and the objects and their settings all that kind of stuff. And so same thing here uh and so we can see all the actions here and we should be able to get rid of them. And so that's why I made sure to name the one that I wanted so that it wasn't um I wasn't confused over there. And let's do it one more time. And so we will export FBX idle selected objects. It's good. Actually, I'm not sure the object was selected. Now it's definitely selected and back over here and get rid of that. Right? But this is a good point for pause here. Right? You bring it in. There's a bunch of stuff over here. Stop and address that issue first. Otherwise, there'll be some problems. So, let's get rid of that. Let's bring in the one we just had. We've got our animation but no mesh. Just to be sure. Animation is checked. This is checked. Everything else is the same. One more time. Look over here. So, I think what was going on there is that uh I wasn't thinking about it because I had solved a different problem this weekend. Is this No, I wasn't using five, I don't think. I think I was still using four four. I need my Blender versions to be coded with some sort of like really obnoxious color so I can remember where which one I'm in. Also, when you add an add-on, sometimes it's tough to tell. Last week, I had up here. I thought it was in this menu. There was a select children box. that I thought was in Blender, but it may have been the result of an add-on that really improved my quality of life. >> Yeah, I just hate doing that. >> Yeah, I mean, sure, you could do that. Right click and say select hierarchy. you know, if you want to waste your life selecting the hierarchy. But damn it, I really thought that was in vanilla Blender. But that's just making a new one. It was definitely here in this menu. All right. Well, I got to drill down on exactly which add-on uh does that. Anyways, yeah, the whole thing wasn't selected. The reason we weren't seeing the mesh is because we didn't have the entire thing selected here. So, in this case, the mesh is two meshes and the armature. So, we need to make sure all that's selected. Um, and there's a phantom checkbox up here that'll keep you from having to do this for the rest of your life. Um, and then back over here, where we're going with this is we've got uh robot um our robot is set up here. If we hit our robot is going to need um an animator if we unfold down here. Now we see good things. One um this is all the stuff that comes in as the FBX. We've got um in this case two materials um that's irrelevant because we're going to replace them with the stuff that we brought in from Substance Painter. So that can either be there or not. We have the uh actual meshes here in here. And then we have a single um uh animation clip. Cool. And with that in mind, if we grab our animation clip here, if you play it over here, you should see it happening, which is good. Um, but that's just the preview window. And if you don't see your character when you import like we were before, that's a problem. Again, stop. Uh, but if we drag the clip onto there like so, you see it does automatically creates the animator for us. And then if we looked at the animator, it sets it up as being the default thing. And so now, even if we were to uh put throw this into play mode, we should see our character idling. There they are. It's not looping yet. We look at the uh over here. Selecting the top of it. Unfortunately, there's some clicking that needs to be done here, some massaging the data once you get it into Unity is that uh you need to tell uh Unity which of these things are going to loop and which ones are not. And so when you select the asset, we set a lot of this stuff up. And so what do we need to do here? It's mostly looping right now. Yeah, because the speed will adjust here. But unfortunately the loop, you know, is part of the asset data. It would really be wonderful if it was here, but it's just not how the structure of everything is set up. And so, um, we need to say that's going to be something that happens and apply it. We'll do that again with the run, but not with the jump. And so, we have that. And then this is set up. We can adjust the speed here. We'll keep it where it is for now. We look at it and hit play. There we are. Just idling away. Wonderful. Now, um we'll make it look even more awesome by um moving this up underneath our capsule, which is, you know, a movable thing in the scene. So, I'll turn that back on here. And uh let's look orthographic over here to get this properly aligned uh to our capsule. And so here I'm going to go to this and excuse me there's the capsule collider which we'll need to keep. And then there's the renderer which is drawing the capsule which we won't need. And so we want you know our character to line up with the hitbox of the capsule here in this case. And so let's um bring this up underneath over here. And then uh we can make the adjustments for this being at the right height right about there for now. And so now uh we have that Yep. All right. And we're done, everybody. Okay. Looks good. Is it a little too high up on Ne? Come down just a little bit more. Even if the feet go a little bit into the ground, that's usually preferable than looking like you're floating. But you can see fundamentally how this is working, right? We have all of the, you know, structure for moving stuff around and which is up here at the top level and then all of the actual visual and animation information which is down here. Okay. And right now this is just looping. But uh once we get our other two done, we'll bring those in up here. Then we'll connect this stuff to this so that um when we when we move it runs and when we stop it idles and when we jump it jumps. Make sense? Okay, this should be clearing some things up I think. So, let's get out of here and continue on our journey over here and save",
    "transcript_segment": "going to be all right here. So, let's go with that for now. Um, let's go ahead and save incremental and let's go ahead and export this um as our idle animation. Gavin lulled at something. I don't know what it was though. selected objects. Let's put it in there. Anything else for now? I don't think so. Oh, let's clip it to one loop. Okay. So, uh crop it to one loop. So, I'm going to use the hips. First of all, before I do this, I'm going to make sure everything has been made cyclic. Um, and I can inspect that by coming over to the graph editor. Um, hitting normalize. And this is, you know, exactly the chart I drew before. We have waves that are happening and they're offset. You know, the next step here would be adjusting some of these waves so they're not all sort of perfect um bezier interpolations here, but that's okay for now. Um so that's good. We see that the it's continuing, but you need to know I would use your hips as the sign here, right? So set the beginning at the first hip key frame, set the end at the last hip key frame. That's going to be beyond or in front of the other uh key frames there. So let's just look at the hips. And so that's going to be from just from here to here. And in terms of should I like I said, this is going to be adjustable later. Should you default on it being too short or too long? I would default on it being a touch too long. But you're going to be able to adjust the timing of this later once we get there, right? In terms of like how fast the idle is going. And so in our case, I just want to make my math easy. And so I'll move this back. And I'm going to scale this down uh till this is lined up exactly at 40 in my case. And then we'll make sure that this ends at 40 so that we have one loop there. Right? You could just work like this as long as you know that the you're going to get this like extra little blip uh when Blender restarts the animation there. It won't be as smooth as it will be when it gets looped in Unity. So, let's save it again and let's export one more time. Export the FBX over here. And did it duplicate or overwrite that one? Let's look. Overwrite. Good. Uh, good. Okay. So if we look over here, the difference, one of the main differences here is that we'll have a slightly more complex character controller, which is right here, character controller CC. And so if we hit play, the control the base level controls are the same. this thing goes around. There it goes. Um, so the this is the top, you know, conceptually this will continue to be the thing. The thing that you're moving around in the game is actually this capsule-shaped entity, right? And our player sort of exists um underneath it, right? And so if you were to bring this in now over here, the idol. There we go. If you look at this Let's make sure one other thing with Blender, we didn't see when I clicked on the import here. When I drag the FBX in, I didn't see my person over here, my robot, which is not We should see them over here. And the thing when you bring in the FBX, there's a bunch of stuff. And so if you unfold, you'll see a bunch of things here. And the uh animation clip that's over here, this is where we're coming in from Blender, right? So up until now we've been animating in Unity because we did a bouncing ball and opening doors and Unity editor is fine for doing some such animation right but you know when you start doing more complex stuff like this it makes sense to do the animation over there and so instead of creating the animation clip in Unity we are creating the animation clip and the animation clip gets saved onto the FBX when it comes in here. Uh, but we've got a couple of them. And so this is a Blender issue where we got multiple actions on the same thing. So let's just look at that real quick. Let's come here. Look at our action editor. And you can have multiple clips on the same thing here. We won't get to get rid of the other ones. This one is just an action. I'm going to name it idle just for the sake of clarity. And you see we switch to the other ones. There's no information there. I think they probably just got brought in from Miximo. So, let's get rid of those. Is that another way at >> Yeah, I I find it clunkier. We're going to stick to the thing where we'll keep each animation in its own file. But um yeah, just because this yeah either I don't thoroughly understand or this interface is not great. One or the two. Um, in terms of the setup there of managing the actions when they come over, we look at our Blender file actions, right? So, up here, usually this is in our view, right? So, right here. Um, but we can change this to Blender file. And so this exposes like what a Blender file really is. It's really just a bunch of data stored in this giant indexed um outline. And Blender will in a way that a lot of other problem programs don't show you all of that stuff right here. Right? A lot of like After Effects, the After Effects file, the A file, you can look at it as like a JSON or something. you can convert to JSON and it's just like a big indexed um database of the key frames and the objects and their settings all that kind of stuff. And so same thing here uh and so we can see all the actions here and we should be able to get rid of them. And so that's why I made sure to name the one that I wanted so that it wasn't um I wasn't confused over there. And let's do it one more time. And so we will export FBX idle selected objects. It's good. Actually, I'm not sure the object was selected. Now it's definitely selected and back over here and get rid of that. Right? But this is a good point for pause here. Right? You bring it in. There's a bunch of stuff over here. Stop and address that issue first. Otherwise, there'll be some problems. So, let's get rid of that. Let's bring in the one we just had. We've got our animation but no mesh. Just to be sure. Animation is checked. This is checked. Everything else is the same. One more time. Look over here. So, I think what was going on there is that uh I wasn't thinking about it because I had solved a different problem this weekend. Is this No, I wasn't using five, I don't think. I think I was still using four four. I need my Blender versions to be coded with some sort of like really obnoxious color so I can remember where which one I'm in.

Um, let's go ahead and open up the one I saved as my starting point, starting position. There we go. And then immediately file save as uh this is going to be my uh robot run robot run. There we go. And and there we go. Okay. So, let's get this into position. So, again, the loop here for our idol. Let me let me be as as loose as my animation was there. What are you guys laughing at? This is like some cool dancing. >> My robot is ready for anything. Um, here we go. Here we go. Okay. Um, just I mean I think I mentioned this before for run or walk, right? If your character is going to be mostly walking and not running maybe on Wednesday. I mean, we'll get through the process today. Wednesday, we could get to a, you know, what if we walked and ran. Um, but let's just get we're going to run before we can walk, which is like the opposite of the saying, but, you know, close enough. Most of our characters are running because they're going to be, you know, b dynamically battling things mostly giant spheres that fall on them. Um, but we need to start in a looping position, right? So, this is going to be one leg forward. Doesn't really matter which one. And then the opposite arm, right? And so, that's the key is that we did this with stubs last time, right? Is that even with stubs, as long as you have the stubs going alternating fashion like this, it works. It communicates run, right? It's not like Mario has really wonderfully articulate legs, right? They're pretty stubby. Um, and so same thing here. Do not key frame feet together and then run because then every time you run, every loop of running will start and end with the feet together, right? Which again, the the wedding walk situation. So, we need to get our character into some run position. It's also, you know, obvious. Do not change the direction the character is facing because that's just going to be Yeah, don't do that. That's going to be a hassle. So, even let's say you bring your character in over here because I was consistent with it, but some people run into this. Um, you come in and your character is not facing the right way. Uh, for instance, like this. And then you end up with this situation. Um uh you can compensate for that fairly easily just by rotating the character relative to its parent. Right? So once you have it underneath here, you can do this and then as long as you don't move or rotate the entire body position in Blender, it'll be off by the same amount and that'll work. Um, so in my case, it was correct, but that that definitely happened. So that's how you would address that. Back to here. Okay, let's get this into some run here. And so I'm going to go ahead and grab uh this one. In this case, I'm going to um set a lot of my blockout here in side view. Uh let's make sure that we have key framing on here. I'm at the beginning. And do I need to get rid of any of these? No. I'm definitely going to need hips, neck, and hands. Uh hips, neck, and um feet. I'm going to add here, right? So, uh, let's go ahead and do that here and here. And probably take our hip here and this down a little bit. Give it some more forward motion. Like so. And I'll take this one. And I want to get rid of that sort of movement I had here. Right. So, how is the I'm making this forward. So, how is the character going to go from their rotated leg in Unity to this? And that's the magic of what's going to happen in the animator is that it's literally like you got faders but like one fader for every bone, right? it's gonna actually, you know, fade between those two things, uh, between those two animation positions. And that's the for all of the hassle that the Unity, um, animator is, right? I'm not totally in love with that interface. Um, it is a little bit more, that part of it does work, right? I'm moving these knee controllers out um a little bit forward here so that my knees continue to point forward while I'm running. If you keep them too close to the body, then um that gets weird. And so we don't want the knees doing that. And let's look over here. Here we go. G moves back like so. And let's get our arms together. So over here, uh, this is my right arm and my sorry, left character left here. And so left leg is forward and so left arm needs to be back. And over here, And we have our head here. I'm going to compensate a little bit for what's going on. Feel like this could be a little bit further forward, a little bit further backwards, depending on how dynamic this run is going to be. Okay. And let's do a little quick inventory here to make sure. Um, yeah. So, my leg IK is here. I just have location right now because I didn't rotate those. And yeah, I think that's fine. We're not going to have the ankle, you know, turning during this. We're going to try and keep the feet uh straight, aligned straight. Uh our neck has rotation because that's an FK controller. And then our hands have both both both on the hips. So, we're good. And the other thing we can do here with this position is that as this leg comes forward, our hips will be rotating in the direction of that leg. And so if we grab this and sort of look at this, right? If I want to rotate towards that, this would be an instance where I probably go to global here. So I can rotate this, you know, and you can see again the power of IK here. I get a lot of body adjustment by having that setup, right? I can position the hands where I want them and then move this and it creates this offset motion in the body. So, that's good. Let's fold this up so it's not too complicated. Right now, I had key framing on the whole time. And so, that is good. Okay. Um, yeah, let's go with that for now. And let's go ahead and set up our loop for",

Um, you know, that's looping 101. Copy and paste the beginning to the end. Do whatever you want in the middle. And now, uh, we obviously need to have the, uh, let's make the math a little bit easier here. And I'll just move this out to 30. So, we can just come over here to 15 right now, just to keep everything fine, right? And so, we can want the the opposite uh, happening now with the other side. So, let's make sure that this is still on here. And we'll move some of this. And yeah, uh let's this like you know essentially we want this to come up to here. But a little bit of difference between them just makes it seem a little bit more naturalistic, right? That they're not it's not exactly a repeat of the other one. Um and so let's move this forward. What happened? Did my knee controller get weird? Where's my knee? Oh my I had these on when I moved them. That's no good. The pole. So, I'm going to delete the pole track. There we go. Okay, that's where I want it. Now, I'm not going to touch those. So, back to here. back with this on. Now we should get a less weird result. Let's say I got these set up as the child of those That was not happening before when I moved this one, was it? Yeah. Okay. So, if you're using the mix mode one, we'll need to key frame both so these stay in front. So here and here. This would be definitely a something to make sure is happening in our view over there. There we go. And same thing here. Let's do it in orthographic view. So, making sure the knees stay forward. Let's get the feet where we want them. Then we'll come back and adjust those. All right. So, here, here, here, and get our other foot going the other way. So, here. Yeah, let's do that because this is the way this rig is set up. In a lot of other rigs, these are not a child of the foot controller. And so that's our primary issue here is like these are flying around while this is moving back and forth because they're underneath the rotation of that. So let's make a slight adjustment. I'm going to clear the deck on the feet. And let's go ahead and make sure that we have a G key here. And then this one here. So, this is a little bit different from the Rigipy rigs. Um, this rotate this controller here. This is what they're using for um rotating around the ball of the foot here. But the confusing thing is that uh this is a G. And so moving this is sort of parented to the foot. And so moving this up and down sort of rotates uh where we would want this to be there like so. And by doing that you see that our knee controller does not fly all over the place as we're moving that which is much more desirable. Right? So in this one, if you did use the mixo and then the mix animo, our big new thing here is do not rotate the foot controller. Use whatever the name of this one is. What did they name this? foot control cursor left. And so this, even though it kind of looks like rotation, is going to be a position thing. And if we look at it, yeah, location. And over here, let's make sure we got the same ones. So G. And then over here, um, G to sort of point the toe there. And so moving this and moving this is going to result in our rotation there. Cool. All right, that'll work. Uh, let's again make this like this over here. Crl + C and Crl V on all of these. There we go. Now in the middle, we should have an easier time of it because we'll be able to take this one and move it back and adjust our toe here with this And again, I'm going to make sure that these are far enough forward. Make sure I'm not key framing that. Don't want key frames there. Much better. And let's get our other one. There we go. Uh, this foot forward and like so. so we got position and back. There we go. That's better. Let's save incremental and just get our arms going the opposite. So, we have arms here. Now, we need our arms going the other way. Yeah, it's very peculiar because this does stay put one the way one would want. There we go. And let's check it out there. There. And now we want our hips in the game. A little bit different about this is that um this is an up. This is an up and this is an up. And so the down is in between these. And so our hip key frames here we've got our hip. And then in between these two, our body is coming down a little bit here. And then back up. And then we can move down again in between. And here. Make sure we're going back up. And so we should have that's our next part of this happening. That's good. Um, let's have a little bit of back and forth rotation here. And so here on the down, I'll come forward as well slightly and then back up and same thing here. forward slightly. Save incremental. Getting there. Loosening things up. Hip rotation. And so let's look at that from the top. And so here we want to be rotated this way slightly. And then when we get to here, we're going this way slightly. And then we want to make sure we get back to the same rotation there. So this one. Crl + C. Crl V. Getting there. That gives us a little bit more upper body movement for free there. That's good. Let's go to head over here, which is going to kind of follow our uh hips. And so, actually, let's get our feet. um on the ground, right? And so the nice part of the IK is that we get, you know, this knee and um elbow movement happening uh as a result of, you know, what's going on there. But the bad thing is when we block it out like this, we have the basic stuff, but then the um limbs just sort of move in a straight line back and forth between those because that's all we've done. We set, you know, two key frames, right? And so this middle position here, which is going to be our um where we actually need our passing pose, right? When the feet pass each other like this, they're not both in the air. At some point, your feet need to touch the ground when you're running. I'm not one of the coaches here at GCC, but I know that that is for sure the case. >> It's a new strategy. >> Yes. I suppose if you didn't if your feet didn't touch the ground when you were running, that could be certainly an aerodynamic. you seems like you would have less friction, right? Uh never touching the ground. Um so here when the foot is coming back, it's this foot that is propelling us forward. This foot is coming up and around. Eventually we need to get to our legs making a circular pattern, right? And so we've got this end and we've got this end. We need to uh work on those two positions here. And so at this point, this is the foot coming back. In my case, it's the left foot. Um, and so we need to get this down and make contact with the ground here. And between rotating this and moving this like so. If we look at this now, comes down. And you know, depending on how we're running here, actually, maybe it's more of a toe. So, let's move this up. Let's move this. Again, I'm making sure that I'm not setting new key frames. I'm just sort of um moving this as would need to be there. There we go. And then over here, let's do the same thing for this foot. So again, G and G. So you can see that does a lot to start to give us our circular movement for our legs. Um, we could start to adjust this a little bit more. Um, also the important part is that the hips are coming down at that point. And again, the miracle of IK allows us to, if we want to have more compression, we don't need to adjust everything. We can just sort of move the hips down a little bit there. We're not going to do too much of that. Uh, we still need to be able to get that leg forward in terms of some people get really really obsessive about this kind of thing happening. I mean this is going to be happening very very quickly and um yeah in general slight amounts of pass through like that just gives it much more naturalistic sort of look you know in handdrawn stuff no one even cares about that right in terms of like things passing through each other or uh the physical part of it but you know the fact that we can do like quoteunquote physics stuff in 3D kind of gets people derailed sometimes with that kind of thing But that's pretty good. Let's look at it over here. Let's um make the whole thing cyclic. So I'll shiftclick shift E make cyclic so that I can see this continue to run again. The hitch here is just it repeating the Blender file. So, we've got the legs moving in a more circular fashion. We need to get the same thing happening for the arms here, right? Because you could I mean the the arms are, you know, you could do one or the other. You could have them be IK or you could have them be FK. If you have them be FK, the swinging of the arms is much easier because you're only dealing with rotation. Uh but perhaps the positioning of them is a little bit more awkward because you don't you have to rotate them into position. So, um, in this",
    "transcript_segment": "all of this. And so I'm going to grab all of these and control C and uh controlV out here at the end. And so now, you know, no matter what I do in the middle, I'm going to have, you know, quote unquote a smooth loop or at least I'll get back to the same position. All right. Um, you know, that's looping 101. Copy and paste the beginning to the end. Do whatever you want in the middle. And now, uh, we obviously need to have the, uh, let's make the math a little bit easier here. And I'll just move this out to 30. So, we can just come over here to 15 right now, just to keep everything fine, right? And so, we can want the the opposite uh, happening now with the other side. So, let's make sure that this is still on here. And we'll move some of this. And yeah, uh let's this like you know essentially we want this to come up to here. But a little bit of difference between them just makes it seem a little bit more naturalistic, right? That they're not it's not exactly a repeat of the other one. Um and so let's move this forward. What happened? Did my knee controller get weird? Where's my knee? Oh my I had these on when I moved them. That's no good. The pole. So, I'm going to delete the pole track. There we go. Okay, that's where I want it. Now, I'm not going to touch those. So, back to here. back with this on. Now we should get a less weird result. Let's say I got these set up as the child of those That was not happening before when I moved this one, was it? Yeah. Okay. So, if you're using the mix mode one, we'll need to key frame both so these stay in front. So here and here. This would be definitely a something to make sure is happening in our view over there. There we go. And same thing here. Let's do it in orthographic view. So, making sure the knees stay forward. Let's get the feet where we want them. Then we'll come back and adjust those. All right. So, here, here, here, and get our other foot going the other way. So, here. Yeah, let's do that because this is the way this rig is set up. In a lot of other rigs, these are not a child of the foot controller. And so that's our primary issue here is like these are flying around while this is moving back and forth because they're underneath the rotation of that. So let's make a slight adjustment.

And so we'll grab our run here, bring it in, do our initial check. If I look at it, feel like the number of frames is wrong. Shouldn't have a hitch in it there. Let's look at the F curves. I'll say normalize. And in this case, I want to check them because I think what happened is maybe I missed a cyclic on something, right? It looks there's a lot of information here, right? When you look at it all at the same time. So, I just want to see some of it. And so I'll go back to only selected. Let's come back here. View only selected. Now if I come back to graph editor. So you have to be in timeline. Now back to graph editor. And so I can look at each thing. Looks good. Let's go ahead. Looks good. I'm making sure things are looping. Yeah, no hitch in it there. And that seems fine. Let's see if this is just in our preview here. How many frames does it say? It is 33. That's confusing because shouldn't be 30. Let's just make sure we're not 30. 30. We think it' be some sort of key frame conversion there, but Blender is set to 30. Let's just make sure it's not doing anything weird over here. That all looks fine under animation. All right. For the time being, I could edit this and sort of clip off the extra part that was over there just by putting this at 30 here. And we do want to say loop. So, we got that happening. Okay, let's get this happening on our character. So, um, we should be able to bring this directly in like so. If we didn't name the action, it just comes in as armature action. We can rename it here. Right? So, all the key frames come in. So, this is the magic. See all this here at the beginning, right? We didn't, this is not what it looks like in Blender. And so when we made cyclic, it makes these key frames that are at that position at the beginning when doing that FBX export, which is the nice part. Um, let's see. Sometimes the renaming of the things within the FBX import can be finicky in that whether or not it's like right protected in order to take care of that. But in our case here, right? It won't let you click here to rename. But if you come back to here, here now I can say armature run and I have loop. I trimmed if necessary and I said apply. Okay, good. All right. So now how do these things talk to each other? If we look at the I'll show you the script here in a second, but essentially um the character controller keeps track of a few things. One, the speed of the character. It keeps track of the is grounded, right? We've talked about that before in terms of that needs to happen just to make sure that you can't just double jump your way out of the game or triple jump, right? Just keep jumping. It only lets you jump when you're on the ground. And so we have the speed, the is grounded, and later we can add like a is is dashing, right? Do do we did you press the dash button? Another um boolean um thing. And those are the main ones for now. And so this data it keeps track of is a float, right? Because speed is not a true false. It's like how fast are you going. Grounded is a bull because this is, you know, are you touching the ground or not? That's just a true false in the computer. And then dashing will also be a bull when we add it later.",

Okay, let's get this happening on our character. So, um, we should be able to bring this directly in like so. If we didn't name the action, it just comes in as armature action. We can rename it here. Right? So, all the key frames come in. So, this is the magic. See all this here at the beginning, right? We didn't, this is not what it looks like in Blender. And so when we made cyclic, it makes these key frames that are at that position at the beginning when doing that FBX export, which is the nice part. Um, let's see. Sometimes the renaming of the things within the FBX import can be finicky in that whether or not it's like right protected in order to take care of that. But in our case here, right? It won't let you click here to rename. But if you come back to here, here now I can say armature run and I have loop. I trimmed if necessary and I said apply. Okay, good. All right. So now how do these things talk to each other? If we look at the I'll show you the script here in a second, but essentially um the character controller keeps track of a few things. One, the speed of the character. It keeps track of the is grounded, right? We've talked about that before in terms of that needs to happen just to make sure that you can't just double jump your way out of the game or triple jump, right? Just keep jumping. It only lets you jump when you're on the ground. And so we have the speed, the is grounded, and later we can add like a is is dashing, right? Do do we did you press the dash button? Another um boolean um thing. And those are the main ones for now. And so this data it keeps track of is a float, right? Because speed is not a true false. It's like how fast are you going. Grounded is a bull because this is, you know, are you touching the ground or not? That's just a true false in the computer. And then dashing will also be a bull when we add it later."

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 27, 2025 Setting Up Animator Transitions Um, and so the character controller is already set up to kind of like harvest this information on the tail end of the calculations once you're controlling the character, right? Like you've controlled the character and now in that frame, how fast are we going? Um, are we touching the ground? All that sort of stuff. Um, and the new wrinkle is over here in the animator is that um there are layers. We don't need that right now. But the new thing is over here, this subtab called parameters. And these parameters, this is where you can get get the info from the character controller. The good the script script needs to be set up to forward this information. Um, but it's set up to do that, right? So, it sends that out. And in this case, in order to read this information, these are essentially variables. And as we learned about variables in the past, it needs to be completely correct in terms of the name for this, right? Because it's already set up over the thing. And it's going to be capital S speed and then capital G grounded. And we can see that in the script. If we look over here, if we looked over here, this is all sort of setting the table here at the top. and um yeah initialize animation ids right and so this is um string right strings are words this is where it's setting up the parame you know the parameters that will be available over there and so uh we just need speed and we just need speed for right now if we get to jump we'll need grounded let's do speed first but um over here we The point being needs to be exactly capital S speed. Over here under parameters, you need to set it up capital S speed. Um, we'll hit plus float. There we go. And then you can name it speed. And there we go. And so now again, avoid the big bang. Is this working? Um, fortunately it's easy to tell because Unity should update this number. If it's receiving number, if it's receiving info, you should see it over there. And so if we hit play now and start moving this around, we should be seeing information over there. We've got speed. I said it was a float. The character controller is there. we're not receiving it because this is the other connector right here. So in the character controller in order to be able to set up the character with more flexibility. So in terms of is it going to be a child, is it going to be a child of a child or however you decide to set up your hierarchy over here. I mean it needs to be some kind of child but it could be several layers down is that you need to connect this to this. And so we need to provide this game object here, right? This is where where is the actual animator, the thing that's handling the animations. And so if we bring this into here, right? It needs to be the game object, not the asset, right? Uh because it's the the component, the animator component is on the game object. Now, I believe we should see that data going. Yes, we do. see it all over there. It's updating. We're going a scintillating nine uh unity units per second. The metric here is not that important. The relative numbers are important. Okay. So, a big part tuning the animation and speed and feel of the character is going to be a lot in managing our settings here. And some of these settings, especially the speed, are going to affect sort of the transitions between the animations, right? Okay. So, this is good, but we're not seeing the character run. The character still just slides around in idle. So, um, as you may have suspected, we need to transition from here to here, right? And so, we need to rightclick and make a transition. That's not new. And then we need to rightclick and make a transition back. And so this is going to be the key. And the next part here is managing these transitions because they are more complicated than the transitions we've done in the past where we just said, you know, essentially go to this one next. But now we have um we can sort of make this decision based on this parameter, right? So when speed is zero, we should be idling. When speed is faster than that, we need to be running. And then when speed comes back down, we go back to idle. That's logically I think that's clear, right? Um but in terms of the button clicking, it's a little more cryptic. Um so you have to click on the transition to get to the next menu. And then in here, this is kind of a representation of what of the magic I mentioned of the animator previously, right? This is the fading between the two things. And so this distance right here is useful. The main thing that we want to make sure we do is has exit time. So make sure you put this in your notes. Has exit off. Has exit time essentially I think is terribly named, but it means it would play the entire animation before transitioning. And in our case, for a controlled character, that's not what we want. We want the character to be much more responsive, right? We don't want it to wait till the end of a run cycle to start stopping or wait until the end of the idle cycle to start running. That need it needs to do it in very quick response to the buttons. Otherwise, it's just going to feel like you don't have control over what's happening. And so I think for almost all of our transitions, this will be off. For the jump, you could kind of do it either way, but we'll look at it. But here, we're going to want this off so that we do um have another so that we control the transition and we control the transition here with the conditions. And so this is where that simple logic is set up. If the speed is greater than I'm not going to put this at zero. I'm going to put it like 0.1. Then we need to transition from idle to run. Why did that not change? It says run here. Says run here. Okay, we're just going to imagine this as run for now. Um, and yeah, this is the run. Uh, good. And so now that's good. If we stand here and press forward, we run very awkwardly and then we don't stop. Um, the speed here is going to be a balance in terms of making your feet look like they don't slide on the ground. Is going to be a balance between this number and um this number, a little bit of this thrown in for good measure. Okay. Um as you adjust this, you'll probably need to adjust this in order to make it um look like our feet are planted on the ground for the most part. And clearly it's too slow right now for us. Let's make it maybe two here and see how that works. And right now it plays this and then automatically goes back to idle. So we need to manage our transition back. Uh transition back needs to also not have exit time so that we can quickly update it. And then we need the opposite logic here when the speed is less than a number. And so this number here is going to take some balancing as well depending on how fast your character is going, right? And so right now mine is maxing out like eightish, right? And so I'm going to put this like around two. So that remember this is the time at which the transition will start. So it looks like we're starting the transition before we come to a complete stop. And so now with that in mind, unchecked two. Um, that's on. That's on. Okay, that should be good. Let's look at it. There we go. And we're going back and forth a little bit here. And so I'm going to move these numbers a little bit up to 0.5 here on the enter and then two. And then depending on how long your cycles are here, this transition time may be something to adjust, right? And so there's this right here below has exit time that allows uh for some finer uh adjustments. And so you see that this is our transition duration, right? So 0.25 would be quarter of a second. Let's bring that down to a shorter amount of time. Let's make sure that's good. And then this one here, I'm also going to tighten this up slightly to get some faster response. And this is probably a bit aggressive. I'm going to say 1.3. And I'm going to save. So a lot of this is coming up with a balance depending on how fast your character is going to move between this and the other one. So moving this up a little bit here. Let's go 1.5. We don't want to have these situations where I mean ideally you want this number close to the other number. Having it be exact works sometimes just depends on the animations and how right so now a little bit too slow on the run but now I don't have that situation I was getting that because there was a period of time where you know I was between one and two and so it was saying start the transition but then that was also in the it was staying in that amount of time by the time I got back after after the transition and then it was transitioning back, right? And so this is like it's more of an art than a science, dude. Um here in terms of balancing this in ter to get back and forth between those two transitions. Um still doesn't look I don't like the speed of the feet. Needs a little bit more impetus than that. Um, now we don't have the jump animation in there, so we just if we're running, we just continue to run in the air. Um but yeah, that's a little bit better with that. Um we've I've got the transition numbers which should stay in place. this number stays in place because it's um a number from the asset, not the game object, right? And so that stays uh you don't have to go back and redo it after coming out of play mode. But um now that that's a little bit better, maybe these transitions can be a little bit smoother. Let's see, especially this one here. Expand this out a little bit and let's see how that looks. Cool. And I mean, I would just get it sort of ballparked right now, right? As you play the game, once you get everything else sort of set up and everything, um, clearly these values are going to need to change to sort of tune the player's movement to work in the space, right? And when you adjust these values, you need to adjust the values over there. But just getting sort of a working version of it happening here is going to be the way to go. Um, yeah. So, the necessary things for the character controller script when you add the character controller um CC, it'll automatically make this thing called character controller. This is a Unity component which you know this is kind of like a manager for this thing. This here don't do not touch. Okay. Just leave that as is. This is kind of being uh managed by this. And so you just want to fold that up and then worry about what's happening over here in this. Um, and the for the most part it's finding everything that you would want it to find except the thing that has the animator on it. And so that's what you need to provide right here. So the important thing is that the the game object that you drag into here again must be a game object. Can't be a an asset needs to be the",

It's figuring out real world time and how many frames have elapsed and how far to step the animation. It's doing a similar thing with the physics as well. It's like like when the game runs faster, it's not like the physics speed up. There's like this separate it's figuring out how many frames are happening per real world second so that you don't have Yeah, because obviously that would be you would need to ramp the rate of everything up and down based on how fast the game was rendering and you know that's they did all that. But on the low side, like the low side is different because like there's only you're only seeing so many frames. And so yeah, I mean it's trying to do that, but then in general, we want to keep this above 30, which we should be able to. And then also the other thing is don't get, now that I've shown you this number, don't get crazy about it. um the even if it's dipping lower at different points as you get more things in the game, uh this is the editor number. And so it will be in most cases significantly better once you build the game. And so once we get the character in there in the new template, then we'll do a test build right away to make sure that everybody's is that's working and then we can start to build everything into the whole thing there. Does that make sense? Okay. Um, yeah. So, good question. You don't need to worry about that. Your, you know, main way to control the speed of the animations is going to be in the animator and adjusting that there, right? And then again, like the frame rate of the animations, if we were to look at any of these here, right? If we come back in just like we do in um Blender the we can stretch and expand the frame rate because we have these key frames and it's you know interpolating between them right and so if we increase the space between this we're still getting the interpolation happening between if we had made a bunch of um animation that looked stop motion in Blender and then brought it over here. This that would be more problematic. But that you would probably make it still make it smooth in Blender and then try to do the stop motion effect here would be the better workflow because you wouldn't have to worry about that. Uh you or you could just adjust it here. Anyways, so yeah, we can stretch or smush this as much as we want because these are still key frames and they're being there's the interpolation in between it, which is why I'm not overly concerned about like what frame rate we have blender set in and versus over here, right? Because like in the other classes where frame rate is much more of a thing you need to consciously manage, here you can, you know, kind of fudge it a little bit because things are um different. I think one of my hitches here. What is this yellow line? Something I didn't get back up to the top here. Anyway, um good question. Other questions?",

And so once we get the character in there in the new template, then we'll do a test build right away to make sure that everybody's is that's working and then we can start to build everything into the whole thing there. Does that make sense? Okay. Um, yeah. So, good question. You don't need to worry about that. Your, you know, main way to control the speed of the animations is going to be in the animator and adjusting that there, right? And then again, like the frame rate of the animations, if we were to look at any of these here, right? If we come back in just like we do in um Blender the we can stretch and expand the frame rate because we have these key frames and it's you know interpolating between them right and so if we increase the space between this we're still getting the interpolation happening between if we had made a bunch of um animation that looked stop motion in Blender and then brought it over here. This that would be more problematic. But that you would probably make it still make it smooth in Blender and then try to do the stop motion effect here would be the better workflow because you wouldn't have to worry about that. Uh you or you could just adjust it here. Anyways, so yeah, we can stretch or smush this as much as we want because these are still key frames and they're being there's the interpolation in between it, which is why I'm not overly concerned about like what frame rate we have blender set in and versus over here, right? Because like in the other classes where frame rate is much more of a thing you need to consciously manage, here you can, you know, kind of fudge it a little bit because things are um different. I think one of my hitches here. What is this yellow line? Something I didn't get back up to the top here. Anyway, um good question. Other questions?"

Usually I tell people don't use smart UV project, but in this case it's just two planes, so it'll be fine. And now we have UV so that this spreads evenly. And we can give it more of a cycllorama background here just with a bevel. Or we could use Well, no, we use bevel.

    "video_id": "VQjnDh_yuQ4",
    "search_text": "AVC240 October 27, 2025 Point Lights vs Area Lights Okay, for some nicer looking results here, well, let's look at this first. Up until now, a lot of times I throw in things and make a point light, which is easy enough to understand. You know, this is like adding a light bulb to your scene. light goes in all directions from this. Um we've got our um radius setting here which now is really nice. It's kind of like simulating the fact that this would be coming from one point. The main point, the main thing to remember here is that point light, hard shadows, area light, soft shadows. The larger the light source, the softer the shadows. So when we have something that's very, very, very pinpoint, we get hard shadows. larger, we get soft shadows. That used to mean that, you know, like the point light didn't always have this radius setting on it. Um, and so you would definitely have things like this happening all the time when you use the point light as opposed to an area light where light is going to be coming out of a whole area. So, light area. We've done this before. The area light is nice to use, but it's a little bit easier when you can move it around and it points. That way you don't have to move, rotate, move, rotate, move, rotate. And so in the area light here, let's get both of these down into here. All right. And so the area light I'm going to make a target area light just by adding the constraint which is the uh damped track you know just point at something. Let's make a new target here. Shift a uh empty arrows. There we go. I'll call this area light target. And in the area light under object here I'll have a point at the area light target but you have to have the right axis pointing at it. In this case um negative Z. And so now I can just come up here to the top, which I do a lot when I'm doing this like studio setup kind of stuff, and I can move things around um in world space as long as I have this set to global. And I can move stuff around and have it uh interact with what's going on. And so this makes it easy because it's pointing at that target. Now, if I come back and look through the camera here. Um, in fact, this might uh warrant one of these. And so now uh over here I can uh do this, you know, and grab these and move it around to see exactly how the light is falling on whatever it is that I'm lighting. And so this expedites business quite a bit. And even without the point light on here, in fact, let's make our own separate collection for this. So we'll come over here and we'll say save incremental. We'll come over here and make another new collection. And this one will just be lights. And we'll bring in this and this so that they stay separate and we stay organized. And so there we go. And now uh without the point light. This is just the area light. So allow me to draw your attention to the shadows here. We have this softer shadowing. I'm in EV of course. And then over here much harder shadows. So, previously it was the case that you had to use the area light in order to get soft shadows. Now, the point lights have this radius which allows us to soften up shadows even from the point light. However, on this object here, I'm going to make this one shinier. One of the big separations here is the way the light appears in the reflections. And so let's put these relatively in the same position to compare. And so we'll move these over here to this side. I'll take this G and move it over. And I'll take this and move it over. Oops, not that. This. All right. So you can see the effect here, especially on the highlights changing. Here's point light at no radius at all. Pinpoint prick of light coming out in all directions. You can see here in addition to the shadows how this is falling across that face versus over here we can do a similar sort of thing especially if we turn up the power slightly if we have the right thing selected. There we go. So even with the area light coming down to a smaller and smaller size, we get these harder and harder shadows. Larger softens the shadows up. So in general, this is going to give you more realistic results, but as always, at the cost of render time. It's more how much render time? I mean, not a whole lot under most circumstances for a few lights, but as you had more and more lights in the scene, this would start to multiply and become a thing. There's a reason, you know, this this was only added to Unity within like my recent memory. Like up until then, it was all point lights um because of how expensive they are to, you know, run, especially like in a real-time environment there with everything else that's going on. Um, good. And so",

So, light area. We've done this before. The area light is nice to use, but it's a little bit easier when you can move it around and it points. That way you don't have to move, rotate, move, rotate, move, rotate. And so in the area light here, let's get both of these down into here. All right. And so the area light I'm going to make a target area light just by adding the constraint which is the uh damped track you know just point at something. Let's make a new target here. Shift a uh empty arrows. There we go. I'll call this area light target. And in the area light under object here I'll have a point at the area light target but you have to have the right axis pointing at it. In this case um negative Z. And so now I can just come up here to the top, which I do a lot when I'm doing this like studio setup kind of stuff, and I can move things around um in world space as long as I have this set to global. And I can move stuff around and have it uh interact with what's going on. And so this makes it easy because it's pointing at that target. Now, if I come back and look through the camera here. Um, in fact, this might uh warrant one of these. And so now uh over here I can uh do this, you know, and grab these and move it around to see exactly how the light is falling on whatever it is that I'm lighting. And so this expedites business quite a bit. And even without the point light on here, in fact, let's make our own separate collection for this. So we'll come over here and we'll say save incremental. We'll come over here and make another new collection. And this one will just be lights. And we'll bring in this and this so that they stay separate and we stay organized. And so there we go. And now uh without the point light. This is just the area light. So allow me to draw your attention to the shadows here. We have this softer shadowing. I'm in EV of course. And then over here much harder shadows. So, previously it was the case that you had to use the area light in order to get soft shadows. Now, the point lights have this radius which allows us to soften up shadows even from the point light. However, on this object here, I'm going to make this one shinier. One of the big separations here is the way the light appears in the reflections. And so let's put these relatively in the same position to compare. And so we'll move these over here to this side. I'll take this G and move it over. And I'll take this and move it over. Oops, not that. This. All right. So you can see the effect here, especially on the highlights changing. Here's point light at no radius at all. Pinpoint prick of light coming out in all directions. You can see here in addition to the shadows how this is falling across that face versus over here we can do a similar sort of thing especially if we turn up the power slightly if we have the right thing selected. There we go. So even with the area light coming down to a smaller and smaller size, we get these harder and harder shadows. Larger softens the shadows up. So in general, this is going to give you more realistic results, but as always, at the cost of render time. It's more how much render time? I mean, not a whole lot under most circumstances for a few lights, but as you had more and more lights in the scene, this would start to multiply and become a thing. There's a reason, you know, this this was only added to Unity within like my recent memory. Like up until then, it was all point lights um because of how expensive they are to, you know, run, especially like in a real-time environment there with everything else that's going on. Um, good. And so"

But here, let's go ahead and like set one up manually to sort of get the idea is that at dawn and dusk, we'd have much more orange, right? In fact, um the way too many tabs. How do I keep losing my other tab here. There we go. Um the time around Yes. Around sunset golden hour. So this, you know, uh, lots of filmmakers want their characters to be bathed in this warm, welcoming, you know, evening sunset light. And if you're making a movie, you know, IRL where that's the case or there's a scene or many scenes that are at this time of day and it's, you know, being filmed outside, this is a dramatic challenge because you get like, you know, generously 50 minutes each day to sort of like capture anything. Um, and so everybody needs to be ready to go boom at that exact time and then it's just a race until the sun goes down or until the lighting gets so different that you won't be able to cut between shots. So I helped a friend make a short film that was kind of took the place took place in the film it took place over one day like afternoon into evening. And so you know it took us three and a half weeks to shoot all that stuff because there were so many scenes happening at that time of day. It just really limited the uh uh the kind of thing you know how much time you have to shoot every day. So yeah, magic hour, golden hour. Uh so if we were to do that as an animation here, you know, animating the sun across the sky, it's just a matter of, you know, uh rotating. Not that. But this um remember our sunlight, we don't move the sunlight, we just rotate it. But we'd want it to be in the orange spectrum at dawn and dusk. And then throughout the middle of the day, things are more blue in color. So, I'm going to move this a bit like that. And then rotate this so that just for the shot, it's a little bit more like so. And so, let's do that. Um, I'm going to save incremental. And let's come in here and look at the animation timeline. And I'm going to set some on the sunlight here. Let's make sure we get rotation key frames. And I don't know, we'll do it quicklyish. 150 frames. Maybe you want it to be a little bit longer when you do it. Um, and so right about there. Set that key frame. And now we want to go the whole way across the sky. down into the following evening and turn that off. And so now we have the rotation happening. So, when we're at the t peak here during the day, um this is where we're going to animate the color temperature using the color temperature slider. And so uh let's do our dusk here or sort of dawn. So there is a little bit difference between dawn and dusk especially I mean all this is super dependent where you are on earth what how much smog there is you know all that kind of stuff but in general you know follows this patterns and uh so here let's go ahead and make sure we have a key frame here for this and bring this way down. Sun gets overhead. Much stronger light. Much more blue. I only selected channels. There we go. And coming back down here, we want our sun setting. Sort of our golden hour light. In addition to that, you could animate the strength of the light to some extent. You know, especially depending on where you are in Arizona, things may be getting much brighter and more harsh, right? shooting things here outside during the day just so unforgiving. Super hard, very dark shadows, right? Not not the best. Um, but we have our progression from one to the other. Main thing to remember here, orange, you know, as the sun sets, more blue over top even when we're outside, right? And so, um, yeah, golden hour this, let's save incremental and I'll just output this one. as a movie. [Music] the as that's gone through make sense so far.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 27, 2025 Three-Point Lighting Setup Um, couple ingredients. There's some variations on this just like everything, but most of the time we have our key light. This is our primary light source. to the side of the camera. In general, this is not straight on with whoever it like. We'll set this up here with these busts and sort of talk about this in terms of like there's a character, humanoid character that we're framing and lighting here. Uh this is our primary light source and it's giving us something that's going to be um uneven but in an interesting way. Right? The idea is not to make sure that every surface of the object is equally lit. That's going to look boring in almost every instance, right? Uh the purpose here is to define the shape of whatever it is that we're pointing the camera at using the light in order to um tell a story about whatever it is that we're putting in front of the camera right now. Uh then we're going to have our fill light which is going to be the opposite side and its primary job is to fill in the shadows of the key light. This is um especially in CG as we talked about before the the the default is too perfect, too antiseptic, right? It's not going to um unless you have some sort of bouncing going on. And if you set that up, a lot of times you can have shadows falling off into like digital blackness. And we don't really get as much of that in real life cinematography because there's there's always some degree of ambient light bouncing around off of other stuff to fill in the shadows. Uh but a lot of times we need to do that here. And then um you've got your back um slashrim rim slash hair light. And so this helps um usually define the silhouette. You can have more lights than this, but this is usually what's referred to as the threepoint lighting system. and over here. Um, and so this area light here, uh, we've already set it up with a target, which is great. I'll change it from area to key light. Then we will uh, copy and paste um, this one here. And if I move this over to the opposite side over here, this will be more along the lines of the fill light. So when I do that, it copies and pastes the target as well. Um, so we can either have them have separate targets. I mean, a lot of times to simplify things, um, I usually just have them point at the same target. And so you'd have to set that up here. There we go. And so now even if I moved the target, you know, they both point at it, which is super convenient. Um, great. And so our fill light here, I am going to come down here and drop it down to uh zero. And yeah, in what we have happening with our key light, I'm going to like that perhaps move the key light up a little bit off angle. trying to cast some light across the different faces here in order to um create some definition. And so trying to move things around both from this view and this view. In general, in these studio sit situations, we don't want to move the light itself, you know, it's kind of another 180 degree situation. We usually don't move the light, you know, back behind this um thing. Well, not for the key and the fill the backlight. Sure. But here, you know, we're creating some more definition across the face. We have some contrast now happening on this. Um, yeah. And this is so much fun to do in computer graphics because you're not plugging and unplugging things. You're not setting up tripods. You're not hauling sandbags around any of that kind of stuff. So, it's really um you know really a lot more pleasant of experience to sort of like really experiment with different things by easily moving things around. All of this requires, you know, all of that stuff in term the lights get super hot, especially the old the older ones. You the newer LED lights are pretty nice. And, you know, we can just dial in uh color temperature and everything else here. And so, this is all super useful. But, so this is our key light. If I turn this fill light was off and so the key light now has given me, you know, pretty good definition of the faces. But now I want to use the fill light and I want it to be on the opposite side of the camera. And so this is another thing where I see some people go off script. You know, in my case I have the camera, you know, pointed at my subject here is that my key light is going to be on one side and my fill light is going to be on the other side of the camera. Okay? You don't put your key and fill light on the same side of the camera in typical regular, you know, studio setup. Um and these things in fact I find you'll most of the time the most interesting results are when they're not exactly symmetrical right they um trying to create more interest by having these at different angles is usually a more successful strategy. So if these are on here in the fill um if I can sort of dial this in uh maybe Oops. Let's go here. Go. And what I want is this one. And so, yeah, it's to the opposite side. And the main job of this light is what we're seeing right here. Filling in the shadows. Not to the point that we erase them and now it's back to just flat lighting, but not so they're so dark. Still being able to see some of the first surface detail, right? Which there is none on this one. This is just the standard um material. But over here, you know, a bigger difference, right? So when you can select some things to put in your scene here, think about having a variety of things so you can sort of see how things fall off along the surface. and this material here. If we were to look at this you much more metallic here. I'm going to lighten up the color of this a little bit so that we can >> you can ask a question. I'm sure it's perfectly intelligent.",

This is um especially in CG as we talked about before the the the default is too perfect, too antiseptic, right? It's not going to um unless you have some sort of bouncing going on. And if you set that up, a lot of times you can have shadows falling off into like digital blackness. And we don't really get as much of that in real life cinematography because there's there's always some degree of ambient light bouncing around off of other stuff to fill in the shadows. Uh but a lot of times we need to do that here. And then um you've got your back um slashrim rim slash hair light. And so this helps um usually define the silhouette. You can have more lights than this, but this is usually what's referred to as the threepoint lighting system. and over here. Um, and so this area light here, uh, we've already set it up with a target, which is great. I'll change it from area to key light. Then we will uh, copy and paste um, this one here. And if I move this over to the opposite side over here, this will be more along the lines of the fill light. So when I do that, it copies and pastes the target as well. Um, so we can either have them have separate targets. I mean, a lot of times to simplify things, um, I usually just have them point at the same target. And so you'd have to set that up here. There we go. And so now even if I moved the target, you know, they both point at it, which is super convenient. Um, great. And so our fill light here, I am going to come down here and drop it down to uh zero. And yeah, in what we have happening with our key light, I'm going to like that perhaps move the key light up a little bit off angle. trying to cast some light across the different faces here in order to um create some definition. And so trying to move things around both from this view and this view. In general, in these studio sit situations, we don't want to move the light itself, you know, it's kind of another 180 degree situation. We usually don't move the light, you know, back behind this um thing. Well, not for the key and the fill the backlight. Sure. But here, you know, we're creating some more definition across the face. We have some contrast now happening on this. Um, yeah. And this is so much fun to do in computer graphics because you're not plugging and unplugging things. You're not setting up tripods. You're not hauling sandbags around any of that kind of stuff. So, it's really um you know really a lot more pleasant of experience to sort of like really experiment with different things by easily moving things around. All of this requires, you know, all of that stuff in term the lights get super hot, especially the old the older ones. You the newer LED lights are pretty nice. And, you know, we can just dial in uh color temperature and everything else here. And so, this is all super useful. But, so this is our key light. If I turn this fill light was off and so the key light now has given me, you know, pretty good definition of the faces. But now I want to use the fill light and I want it to be on the opposite side of the camera. And so this is another thing where I see some people go off script. You know, in my case I have the camera, you know, pointed at my subject here is that my key light is going to be on one side and my fill light is going to be on the other side of the camera. Okay? You don't put your key and fill light on the same side of the camera in typical regular, you know, studio setup. Um and these things in fact I find you'll most of the time the most interesting results are when they're not exactly symmetrical right they um trying to create more interest by having these at different angles is usually a more successful strategy. So if these are on here in the fill um if I can sort of dial this in uh maybe Oops. Let's go here. Go. And what I want is this one. And so, yeah, it's to the opposite side. And the main job of this light is what we're seeing right here. Filling in the shadows. Not to the point that we erase them and now it's back to just flat lighting, but not so they're so dark. Still being able to see some of the first surface detail, right? Which there is none on this one. This is just the standard um material. But over here, you know, a bigger difference, right? So when you can select some things to put in your scene here, think about having a variety of things so you can sort of see how things fall off along the surface. and this material here. If we were to look at this you much more metallic here. I'm going to lighten up the color of this a little bit so that we can >> you can ask a question. I'm sure it's perfectly intelligent."

Okay, let's let's test that next. Let's finish the the the setup and then we'll go from there. Okay, so I've got um let's move this over perhaps just a touch. Okay.

We kind of want to separate our subject from the background, right? And define the silhouette of the subject. And as such, I usually take the key light here and let's grab this one and shift D this. And then let's move it up and back. And yeah, we want to be defining our edges here. And so this would be a case perhaps where we go smaller with the light source in order to, you know, create a harder light with more direct shadows and these highlights appearing along the top of the character. And so this setup here super useful for, you know, looking at the final image and being able to move this to wherever it needs to be to make that happen. And again, this is super easy to take care of in these kind of instances. This backlight is going to cast some shadows forward. Most of the shadowing we want to be cast backwards. And so that's just the this is the we'll just say back light here. And like that. And we can also do this which is really useful if we don't want these shadows coming forward like this. We'll leave them on for now. So there's the backlight. There's the key light. There's the fill light, right? And so just the key by itself defining the character and filling in some of the shadow there. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of way more leeway with this one depending on what you're doing, you know. Um, yeah, rim light, hair light. Depending on the amount and/or placement and/or structure of the character's hair, it maybe need a lot more work to do there. One of the other things you'll see occasionally, we're not going to do it here with the stone statues, is an eye light. Get that twinkle in someone's eye. And so, you know, it's usually a very small light that you're placing somewhere. You know, it's it wouldn't be moving around a whole lot in order to get that one twinkle. At that point, especially for our animation workflow, there's a lot of question of like, you know, do I do this quote unquote in camera, meaning like in the render, or do I do it uh in compositing, right? So, I could just put that bright spot exactly where I would want it. So, this is a when we're talking about this kind of stuff, this is a big now that we've done things using both areas. This is a big workflow decision you need to make if you're going to be doing a bunch of shots in such and such style with such and such lighting. It's like how much work is this going to take to set up quoteunquote in camera and then how much um how much could I get away with doing this afterwards in in post or in compositing right so in post you know depending on what you're doing that would mean like possibly later once the whole image sequence is in After Effects and you're adding effects and after effects right or here you know just switching uh layouts over to the compositing view and doing something more directly on the rendered image there in real life production. You know, there it's a much more literal application of that phrase, right? Are we trying to capture this in camera on set or is this going to be added later, right?

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 27, 2025 Studio HDR Applications In addition to all the Blender Blender kit stuff, um, if we come back over here and we look at our shading world, We have our default sky. This changed in um five to some extent. There's uh a few different algorithms here for calculating um this sort of like procedurally done sky algorithm uh that sort of fills in all the space here. The top one the yeah this one's the most fully uh featured. Some of these features, yeah, only available in EV, but um using something like this as a base and then adding in your other light where where needed uh tends to be a pretty good technique here. But we were to look at this because this is all being generated procedurally. There's the um you can see this is a version of what we were talking about previously, right? So for sun elevation here as the sun goes through the sky, we were to zoom out, you'll see it go from night to golden hour to midday and then back down here. Right? So that's the sun elevation whereas the rotation is just sort of changing where things are on the horizon at any point. Right? So this is as long as uh especially if you're not doing something where you are going to see the HDR in the background and you need clouds or something that appears like you know real background then this tends to be pretty useful for that. um the amount of you know be lying if I had any idea like really what these sliders are doing just sort of like salt to taste in order you know they're sort of changing how the light goes through the atmosphere there to create a few different effects but if we were to rotate this around let's back through our All right. The only downside here especially in EV I don't know if this is different in cycles is that you know this is totally lighting based on the HDR right so the HDR as if there's light coming from each pixel you know and hitting the light uh hitting the subject there. That's not exactly what's happening, but when you do it like that, especially in EV, it's not actually doing any of the bouncing there. Let's see if it casts a shadow when we're in cycles or not. I'm not quite sure whether it will. Let's save first. Then jump over and make sure that cycles is set to correctly and make sure that cycles has some sort of reasonable settings. It happened this last time. You know, you give the first cycles experiment and no one listens to the thing about decreasing the samples and someone on Discord is like, \"Oh my god, it's taking forever. Yeah. So, we get a little bit more of what would pass for shadowing here in cycles. Let's do a compare and contrast. Here's cycles. even for 10 samples. This is a bit much. There we go. Let's save that one [Music] versus EV. I think we get drastically different light settings here. I had to do to crank up the intensity. Yeah. So, I don't think we're going to see a huge difference here, but let's look. Almost had it. Oh. There we go. Yeah. I mean, all of this that's happening in there, right? This is because we're bouncing the light around. It's creating all this shadowing here. Same over here. Definitely not. Right. But um just in this pretty haphazard example, right, this was at I don't know 20x render time versus what's happening over here. So keep that in mind. So let's do a compare and contrast here. I'm going to Let's grab something with a really strong sense of where the sun is. There we go. And that gives us this with this again. Our rotation Z here moves this around. And even in EV here, we're getting a sense of the shadowing now because of this because none of this other light is on, right? Yep, those are all off. That's off. And so this is going to be HDR EV. So let's come in here. HDR again stands for what? brightness, not number of pixels. Okay, that's what makes part part of what makes JPEGs not I mean, if you throw a JPEG into the world shader section of Blender, it'll do something. it won't do something nearly as dramatic as what happens when you have some sort of high dynamic range image in there, right? Because if we looked at this EXR files, right? So EXR files are images. Most of the HDRs are going to be in EXR format because they can have more brightness, more that's incorrect, more variation in brightness because there is a larger bit depth, meaning that they allocate more space in the computer memory to store the brightness values which gives you a wider range of brightness values. Right? This is the going from 8bit video games to 16bit video games. Same idea, right? The reason 8-bit video games look 8bit is because you can only represent whatever it is 256 colors with eight bits. whereas you go to 16 bits and it gets to whatever it is either 1024 I don't know the math off top my head but way more and then as you keep expanding it doubling the amount of memory that you're using you get more and more depth and so these have more and more depth which we usually want to keep down because that keeps the image size down but in this case we want more of it okay so the other situation to be aware of here is Yeah. Okay. So that's right. Now this is uh I mean everything we're doing is fake, right? But like the more I put E I put this HDR in in EV with a strong sun location and Blender sort of creates this other sunlight in order to create these shadows in EV, right? And so um that setting is here under world. And I feel like this wasn't checked by default before. Regardless, it I think it's checked by default now. At least it was default for me right now. And so the when I bring in this image and I just rotate the HDR, all of the regular lighting stuff happens plus the kind of shadowing that we were experiencing when I was rotating the sunlight, right? Um, and so let's render this one once. Let's save and do that. and save. And now we'll look at it again in cycles. Get rid of that. Look at this over here. Is it still there? No. Right. And so once you switch the cycles, that's gone there. Um if we look at this again here I mean you can see the difference in the quality of the shadow right the the EV approximation is really good especially for it being you know like one 100th of the render time. Um, but here this shadow is not being faked by creating this other light object that is synchronized with the HDR it. And so the a lot of this is hidden. So like you just check that thing and now it makes a light that's in the same direction. If you have some HDR where it would be harder to tell what the direction is, then I'm not quite sure how it's going to work. But just be aware that that's there. And so this is a much more nuanced shadow there. If we look at this one, if we do the thing here and here. There we go. Right. So, exactly the same settings, just switching the render engine in there. And you can see like how much more nuanced you know the shadow here because of our light bouncing around and our global illumination and everything. We have the shadow actually changing sort of color value over here. Whereas this is like much much much more um you know boring. But again, maybe, you know, if you turn that off and then created your own sunlight where you could dial in the shadows as you wish, you get a more of a, you know, uh, ability to adjust that there. But just be aware that that's that's happening there, right? So, this is a really usually it's a really great base, especially for things that are going to be happening outside. This is quite good. um having this HDR base. Let's look at what the HDR studio looks like. So in this case, if we were to save incremental again and we looked over here at studios, this interface is kind of freaking out. Let's do this.",
    "transcript_segment": "In addition to all the Blender Blender kit stuff, um, if we come back over here and we look at our shading world, We have our default sky. This changed in um five to some extent. There's uh a few different algorithms here for calculating um this sort of like procedurally done sky algorithm uh that sort of fills in all the space here. The top one the yeah this one's the most fully uh featured. Some of these features, yeah, only available in EV, but um using something like this as a base and then adding in your other light where where needed uh tends to be a pretty good technique here. But we were to look at this because this is all being generated procedurally. There's the um you can see this is a version of what we were talking about previously, right? So for sun elevation here as the sun goes through the sky, we were to zoom out, you'll see it go from night to golden hour to midday and then back down here. Right? So that's the sun elevation whereas the rotation is just sort of changing where things are on the horizon at any point. Right? So this is as long as uh especially if you're not doing something where you are going to see the HDR in the background and you need clouds or something that appears like you know real background then this tends to be pretty useful for that. um the amount of you know be lying if I had any idea like really what these sliders are doing just sort of like salt to taste in order you know they're sort of changing how the light goes through the atmosphere there to create a few different effects but if we were to rotate this around let's back through our All right. The only downside here especially in EV I don't know if this is different in cycles is that you know this is totally lighting based on the HDR right so the HDR as if there's light coming from each pixel you know and hitting the light uh hitting the subject there. That's not exactly what's happening, but when you do it like that, especially in EV, it's not actually doing any of the bouncing there. Let's see if it casts a shadow when we're in cycles or not. I'm not quite sure whether it will. Let's save first. Then jump over and make sure that cycles is set to correctly and make sure that cycles has some sort of reasonable settings. It happened this last time. You know, you give the first cycles experiment and no one listens to the thing about decreasing the samples and someone on Discord is like, \"Oh my god, it's taking forever. Yeah. So, we get a little bit more of what would pass for shadowing here in cycles. Let's do a compare and contrast. Here's cycles. even for 10 samples. This is a bit much. There we go. Let's save that one [Music] versus EV. I think we get drastically different light settings here. I had to do to crank up the intensity. Yeah. So, I don't think we're going to see a huge difference here, but let's look. Almost had it. Oh. There we go. Yeah. I mean, all of this that's happening in there, right?

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 27, 2025 Reflection Techniques and Mirror Balls All right, that's freaking out. Let's go somewhere else. So remember we have assets here. There's actually they also have their own Blender add-on. But um for HDRs for studios things sort of fall into two categories. We have these captures of real studios which is I think these are great especially when you're going to be using highly reflective objects because this gives you a lot of like action in the reflections there. there's a lot of stuff to be reflected. Um, where so let's grab something like this and again we see we get the EXR and we should just be able to sub that out in here. And so we can just sort of run this into here and into here. So this has like our fill, key, backlight, all as part of it here. When it's directly parallel, we get a lot of shadowing there. But, you know, this ends up being super strong. Another case possibly where we might want to opt out of that. There we go. Um, and our strength. So, this depending um when I said they had more bit depth, how much more? It depends depending on like is this been used? Is there 10 bits? Are there 16 bits? Are there 32 bits being used here? And so dialing in the strength here can um is usually necessary when doing this. But if we look at this, let's bring this in But the fact is that everything is here, you know, we could run a color ramp or something if we wanted to experiment with this more. that may um decrease our output here. Let's put it back on here. Yeah, that really steps on our levels of brightness. Let's leave it where it is for now. Let's render that one out. And let's look at it over here as well. Yeah. So, we don't get the shadowing box. We get much more of a Remember, I have the samples turned down pretty low and then the dnoising on. So it takes a little bit for it to definitely firm up there in terms of so especially for quick render render situations. I mean, in EV it would be quick. Um, where you're like, I don't want to set up my entire threepoint lighting system and go through all this. Like throwing the sort of studio thing on there is definitely a doable thing. Um, yeah, the ones of, you know, real studios here are useful. But actually, let's test our reflections in here. So, one thing you'll see them do, especially on um sets where there's going to be some sort of visual effects or something added later is that you'll see two things. You'll see a mirror ball and a gray ball. And so, something like this. This would be the role of somebody who is that John Null? It might be John Null. I can't maybe he's sort of a white dude with a beard. But um this and this. So this could be something where you would pull uh you know if this were a high enough uh definition image you could pull this as some sort of HDR and then this to see exactly how the light is falling fall falling across something that's very very very even. And so when you capture right this is someone who's the VFX supervisor on set is usually doing I don't know what's going on there. um doing this. And the idea being that you capture this along with whatever you're shooting in the scene and then later when you go to recreate what you have with, you know, the digital light that's going to be composited of that's going to light the thing that's composited into the scene, if you can get, you know, your gray ball and your mirror ball in the virtual environment to look like the mirror ball and the gray ball in the captured footage, then you're, you know, you've taken a significant step toward having the lighting be correct for the thing that's going to be comped into the into the footage there, right? And so this would be in this case something, you know, like this. We're going to shade smooth this and scale this down and move this up and up. And let's look at this over here. And we'll bring this reference way down like way up. Right. And so that's giving us just pure reflection on whatever it is that's there versus this one. Put this on the other side. Your 50% gray ball would have maximum roughness, no metallic. And then this would be there. So you can really see how the lighting falls across those different subjects there in EV. This is giving you just the HDR in cycles. actual reflections, right? EV can simulate some of this, but it's just a matter of how many bounces. Let's see here. If we come back and grab this, look over here. Yeah, there we go. So, the ray tracing is on now in EV. I thought that was checked by default, but maybe I turned it off there. And so, now we get some kind of reflections happening there. But again, these are faked in a way that's more fake than the way they're faked in cycles, right? Uh so you can tell super clearly now looking at this. There we go. Don't delete that. Um over here, looking at that, you know, that looks like a legit uh reflection. Where's the other one? Not much. Right now, super obvious in this one setting, but in a lot of cases, you don't have objects that are 100% reflective. Uh, a lot of times, as soon as you start blurring the uh reflection, which is essentially what the roughness is, right? Then the our ability to even tell the difference between those two things over here probably becomes really compromised. That's cycles. that's EV, you know, you'd be really hardressed to have anyone besides people in this room paying attention those kind of details notice that kind of thing, right? Um, so there is that. Uh, we've got our lighting set up. Oh, the second time of HDR, you know, this we have the studio where it's an actual studio or it could just be a bunch of um dark and light things on a two to one um backdrop. So over here, if we look at this again, A lot of times we can end up with things like this and this. You know, sometimes they're the result of, you know, renders where we just need a lot of like really high contrast, dark and light uh information in order to create a lot of different variation across the surface of the object. This is mostly for things that are, you know, highly reflective um providing information for, you know, to show up specifically on uh the reflections there. So for instance um something like this and close and reopen once. Yeah. So, these things don't really look like much because they're not designed to. But if you were to bring something like this in, let's look over here. right? Gives me color variation and reflection information across the surface of my objects, especially when Right. So, especially when we're not seeing it in the background because it just looks like a bunch of stuff out there, this can be like a pretty effective bit of lighting, especially as a good base. If you wanted to use something like this, find some angles here. All of the rotation values are kind of on the table because it's not like this has some sort of like specific, you know, some of them look more oriented than others, but you can definitely be in a place where you're experimenting with this, especially if you combine this with a little bit of bespoke lighting. Right? So, if we bring back our key light here, like this in and our key light. Let's back it off power-wise. to sort of provide some basic light for the scene. And then over here, you know, use this essentially as the fill light and everything else. Just sort of moving this around, looking at the final image, trying to find something that's giving us some interesting, you know, variations in color across the surface of said object there, right? Especially when we see these changes there. Um, and so this is pretty, you know, this is an interesting idea, you know, like you can just make these. Um, you know, if you want to make your own HDR,",

So light painter here kind of takes out a step whereas like you make this HDR you're not when you're just making the HDR you're like you have a rough idea where things are going to be but it's not you're going to be able to place them right.

I'm not sure it's going to conflict with this. for which one of these I'd used in the past. And so this is kind of sidest stepping this right. It is if you look at this here It's kind of like dynamically reverse engineering what the HDR should be as you mark where you want the light to fall on the object itself. Um, and it can do this with the HDR or with the light by creating new light objects. So, a really interesting way, you know, not super useful for stuff where things would be moving, but for stills in particular, where stuff is going to be placed fairly regularly and you can, you know, exactly where you're going to want your highlights and everything to be, you know, the first step is setting up some sort of situation like this where I'm able to move the lights and then watch exactly what's happening over here. But sort of the next step here is using something like this. And yeah, this one this has been up updated, right? I think this is happening. Yeah, last year. Yeah, we were able to use this one. So, um yeah, super super useful. Um so, light painting kind of takes that additional step out of there. like you could just come in and, you know, experiment with things to make an HDR, bring it in here and experiment with it further. Um, or do something like this where it's kind of, you know, placing things on the fly based on thinking about this really no longer as like a threedimensional studio, but like an image and I want more light here, less light there.

So, a really interesting way, you know, not super useful for stuff where things would be moving, but for stills in particular, where stuff is going to be placed fairly regularly and you can, you know, exactly where you're going to want your highlights and everything to be, you know, the first step is setting up some sort of situation like this where I'm able to move the lights and then watch exactly what's happening over here. But sort of the next step here is using something like this. And yeah, this one this has been up updated, right? I think this is happening. Yeah, last year. Yeah, we were able to use this one. So, um yeah, super super useful. Um so, light painting kind of takes that additional step out of there. like you could just come in and, you know, experiment with things to make an HDR, bring it in here and experiment with it further. Um, or do something like this where it's kind of, you know, placing things on the fly based on thinking about this really no longer as like a threedimensional studio, but like an image and I want more light here, less light there. So, uh, interesting and useful. Um, we've used that add-on, I think last spring we used it once or twice. And one last thing here is let's look"

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 27, 2025 Gobo Setup and Shadow Casting goos. Uh, gobo is going to be something that you put in front of the um light to create a shadow. This kind of thing in real life here. Uh we're going to want there's unfortunately this is another one where there's difference between um cycles and cycles supports a sort of builtin uh gobo but I think it's easier here because EV does not um is to just build actual uh gobo with a transparent image and then that will or semi-transparent image an image with um an alpha channel and then this will work in both whereas if you set something up specifically in cycles it doesn't work in EV. So, with that in mind, um, let's go ahead and I'm going to create another I'm going to duplicate the key light here, but then I'm going to turn this off and change it from area to spot. And then, um, let's make sure we have the right thing selected. And I'm going to change this to spot. Here we go. Let's grab our gobo I downloaded before class. >> Agreeable. Coo goble. And so let's get a new mesh here. And let's get a material on this mesh. We will call this plane gobo. And we will put a material on it. We will bring in an image. This one here, this is a PNG with an alpha channel. So, it should come in here. And if we look at their alpha in the alpha, let's see. Are we in cycles? No, we're in EV. Good. And I'll come out of this here. so we can see what we're doing there. Let's go ahead. We've got the color going into the alpha on this gobo. We're going to take the gobo and we're going to make it a uh let's see here. Actually, you know what? I'm going to delete the spotlight. and setting up the initial thing here will be easier if everything's aligned. So, let's make a new light spot. There we go. Let's move this directly up. GZ. There we go. And now, um, maybe a little bit higher. GZ again. Moving it directly up. And now I'll take my gobo and shift drag it underneath the spotlight like so. And so now if I were to rotate the spotlight, the cobo goes with it as one would think. And we could then additionally um damp track the gobo uh to the target. There we go. The positive negative Z. And so now if I look at this from the top up here and grab our spot, which is the thing we're actually moving around. There we go. So I've got this set up now. and the spotlight itself. Let's pour some more light into this and get some much more interesting uh lighting falling across the surface of the object. Our radius here, obviously you don't want it here. That looks so fakey mcfake fake. And so we can soften that up. Um, and we could play with, you know, whether this is moonlight. So, moonlight's going to be more in our blue side of sunlight reflecting off the moon. And the other main thing to adjust here is going to be our I mean the main thing is going to be the radius to sort of soften this up in terms of pattern. But then we should be able to get some more variation by moving the gobo. But we don't we don't want to we want to make sure we maintain its orientation. So you'd want to make sure that you are in local space so that you can move it directly closer or further away from the um the light there and sort of like the focus of what's going on. And so this technique, you know, I think in cycles you can the lights will show up down here and you can bring it in as this. And that's nice. This I think is especially for this week learning about goos is I think very clear. We put a thing in front of the camera to cast shadows. We are putting a thing in front of the camera to cast shadows. So there's no abstraction. That's very good. Um and uh yeah, this should work in both here and here. Yeah. So when we get into these more detailed light functions, you can see how things start to separate here between EV and cycles, right? A lot of what we've been doing especially the first month was like real you know just general type of things and they like a really good job has been done to make EV um feature have feature parody with cycles in that way and that's no small feat right um this this whole situation used to be like they were just totally totally different right like I've mentioned this before in you know we used Cinema 4D over the course of the trajectory of that company buying another company that made a different render engine and incorporating that render engine into uh Cine 4D. And then that required, you know, switching from what the EV equivalent was to the cycles equivalent required replacing all the lights and all the cameras with these other objects and all the materials. The materials are totally different like this. The fact that the same BSDF shader node, you don't need to change those out going between both is, you know, not insignificant. Like there's a lot of work that went into that. But the the crux of the matter is they're lying to you, right? It's not the exact same code on both of them. they've just made the same uh inputs and outputs and they roughly you know 90% of the time do similar or very very similar things but not 100% of the time especially when we start to talk about these small details is that we get these differences between the two and so yeah switching between cycles and EV is you know a handful of times if you're doing something very simple you can just flip the switch spend a little bit more time rendering and call it a If you're going to do anything more specific, knowing where you're going to render from is a decision you probably need to make a little bit earlier on so you can make so you can be looking at that while you're adjusting all these sliders because we can see that they look different in the different render engines. And then B, um it's, you know, a different amount of time and render wrangling that you would need. I mean, Eevee, the strength of it is it's very wizzywig. I've used that term before, right? What you see is what you get. Wizzywig. And cycles is less wizzywig, but more um possibly more realistic, right? Depending on what you're doing. So, those two things. I mean, it's but it's a great time. It's an amazing time to be doing this. It's the best time ever. um you know like the programs used to be there was no wizzywig option you in order to get any idea of what the hell it's going to look like when you render you had to render and that took way way longer and so now with the fact where you know thanks to a lot of things but video game technology being one of them and the fact that people wanted to see things in real time a lot of that has trickled over into this arena and so we can see things kind of like in in real time.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 27, 2025 Music Video Project Discussion >> Action. Sure. Yeah. So we usually do um so we'll talk about this a little bit on Wednesday. We usually do like a title sequence as one of the final projects for this class. Um, and then we also do, you know, like a commercial or music video kind of thing as like a thing before the final. And so we'll talk a little bit about it on Wednesday. But in addition to doing, you know, just sort of exploring the lights and getting everything worked out this week, um, think about storyboarding your music video. in this case like not a video for the entire song that's obviously going to be too long right but you know something I don't know 10 to 30 seconds something like that um of a particular tune uh using the idea being to leverage all of the techniques that we've used here um up until this point in the semester >> yeah you can pick it in this ter in this case in order for it to be a compelling thing for everyone to have fun doing like we can like the the again the reason we're not I tell people not to use the copyrighted stuff on the recordings is not because it's illegal I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice but the the it just gets pulled down off of YouTube because the whole thing is automated right it's just searching for those things um and it's important for the class I be able to make the recordings. Um, if you make something with a copyrighted track, we're in an educational institution here and this is a class and so as far as I understand, you're thoroughly protected from litigation by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and that this falls under the Educational Fair use clause. So, you can pick something that you find compelling to use. We'll probably mute it when we're watching it in class to just avoid that whole problem. But um yeah, making a music video for the, you know, YouTube safe music tracks is not just not a super exciting project that anyone's going to get real pumped about. Yeah. >> Is there a way you could mute it on the stream? like um yeah, I can do that, but the microphone still picks it up. Um >> the microphone. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, just mute it. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, now that you mentioned it, I think if I just route my OBS because I do have the the mute, I mean, you guys are hearing that on the recordings, right? Like when I play back the recordings, I usually hold down my, you know, I have what I set up zero here as my cough button, right? So in radio, like so that you're not all over the the recordings all the time, there's like a a they have a big button that they can jam that sort of mutes their thing. And so I have that set up here so that this isn't picking up the feedback from the speakers of, you know, because the audio from the videos that you make gets routed directly into the recording, but then it's also coming out of the speakers and into the microphone again, which makes it sound flangy. And so that I hold this down most of the time except when I'm just making jokes about whatever you said. Um, but then if I route that to all of the audio, so that would mute both the recording audio and the microphone audio, then I suppose that would work. So, and then we can just post them to Google Drive or whatever so that everybody could, you know, download and listen to them properly. So yeah, that actually that's a good idea. I'll see if I can set that up. I think it's just one more checkbox in OBS, but I'll look. But they Yeah, then way I think we would hear it here, but not there. I'll test it. So start kicking that around in your mind, right? What think about, you know, building on the kind of things that we've already done here as far as like the style of it. mean I'm gonna want you to do the things that we've done, right? So, thinking about uh you know, our shot sizes, our framing, our composition, all of those kind of things when you're making storyboarding the video. But in terms of like the rendering and everything else, again, think about what's doable, right? I mean, if you come back and say, I'm going to make, you know, this thing that happens on a beach with a ocean sim and cycles you know, like probably not. Um, that's not going to work. >> But yeah. Okay. So, we'll go over some of that on Wednesday and look at everybody's 180 degree videos. Sound good? Yeah. So, we'll start, you know, we'll storyboard the music video this week. So, think about something that a piece of music that you're going to want to listen to a lot and also think about your workflow now, right? That's a big part of doing this, right? Like the it's not setting up the entire music video like we did the 180 degree scene is probably not even in our case where it's like a shortened thing. It's not the entire song. It's like 10 30 seconds of it. having it all be one scene that you're then cutting between the cameras. Maybe that works, but especially if you want to have separate locations is probably some combination of cutting between the different cameras and then also just straight up editing after the fact in After Effects to put together the the edited pieces, right? So the editing becomes sort of like multi-stage there in terms of like you've edited out different shots, you know, or you can completely forget about doing camera switching in Blender, render out a bunch of different shots and then put it together later in After Effects. That's also a totally legitimate, especially for a music video where there's probably a lot more cuts per 30 seconds than there are certainly in like a featurelength film. Um, and so being able to switch back and forth very quickly between things, right? thinking about it in terms of what do I maybe it's more like a, you know, experimental collecting situation where I'm just getting all these different shots and then I'm going to get them have them work together with the music later. >> Sound good? Yes. might be >> you guys like like >> I >> Well, I mean I just want to make sure I'm not I don't have some like completely misrepresented uh idea of how I act in class, right? I'm not like jumping on people when they ask questions saying like, \"Man, that was dumb.\" You know, like I've I've never said that directly to anyone, right? And now that I've said it on recording, I'm sure someone's going to pull that out. But um but yeah, like please just ask the question >> like I don't even know if they possible but like yeah just like if you could have like an audio and like have it linked to like the timeline like as you're working so you could like have the music playing at the same time as you like >> yeah you can kind of get that happening in Blender. That's one of the things it's like not great at. But um in After Effects 100% you can have that there. Yeah. >> Just like I don't know. >> I mean if you're just doing it for vibes the far simpler solution is just play it in the player, you know, like um in some other player. But like >> more like timing shots like like you know >> Yeah. I mean depending on how accurate things are going to be. I mean, you just give yourself a lot more wiggle room to just like, you know, render shots with a little bit of before and after. And that way, um, you can specifically time them. After Effects is going to excel way more if you need it to be this because in After Effects, you can see the entire waveform on the timeline. The thing that After Effects thinks at is playing it back, but as long as it's visually synchronized with that part of the song, then that'll be where it happens in the render. So, yeah, you're just asking a lot of Blender or any 3D situation at that point, right? Cinema 4D also not great at this. like the the there's so much overhead computationally wise to make the images that then trying to sync it with the audio is like even just for playback is not trivial. Like that's not like audio is in a completely different timing paradigm. There's like 48,000 cycles per uh samples per second, right? And so then you're resolving that with what's going on in the frame rate and you know it's just it's it's a lot for for the rendering environment. >> Is there audio in the video? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. But at that point like if you're just using Blender as the video editor, it probably makes sense to be in After Effects, right? Because I mean the the blender video editor thing is good as we saw last time like you know it's still not after like after effects is literally like 40 years of doing that at this point like I don't know what it is but probably like 99% of music music videos are eventually put together if not whole cloth you know a lot of them and after effects has contributed significantly Yes, >> this may be a really dumb question. Is profanity allowed in the songs? >> Yeah, I mean >> like >> this is a college class. It's in the syllabus that we're going to experience art of all kinds and everyone needs to be prepared for that. I would ask you to use like you're not offending me, okay? But we're all in this together here. So, you know, uh, be responsible, right? Member of the community as far as I is concerned. >> I literally thought that Yeah. Again, like everything we make, the idea is that this is something that goes into your portfolio, right? So, like the my sort of blanket advice, you know, let's because a lot of you you don't do this all the time, but like definitely other students do are like, I'm going to make this thing that intentionally looks really awful and offensive. I'm like, okay, you know, like that's that's a legitimate artistic statement to make. It may not be a very profitable one, right? You know, not that all the art needs to be about making money, but like you ideally you want to spend your time here making something that you can show to other people under most circumstances, right? So, keep keep that in mind. I wouldn't, you know, I was gonna say I wouldn't pick a bunch of two live crew songs, but I mean, do you guys even know who that is? Yeah. Yeah, look it up later. Not at school. >> Cool. All right, great. So, look forward to seeing everybody's stuff on Wednesday. I'm sure we're gonna get some interesting stories and cutaway shots. I'm looking forward to it.

But um but yeah, like please just ask the question >> like I don't even know if they possible but like yeah just like if you could have like an audio and like have it linked to like the timeline like as you're working so you could like have the music playing at the same time as you like >> yeah you can kind of get that happening in Blender. That's one of the things it's like not great at. But um in After Effects 100% you can have that there. Yeah. >> Just like I don't know. >> I mean if you're just doing it for vibes the far simpler solution is just play it in the player, you know, like um in some other player. But like >> more like timing shots like like you know >> Yeah. I mean depending on how accurate things are going to be. I mean, you just give yourself a lot more wiggle room to just like, you know, render shots with a little bit of before and after. And that way, um, you can specifically time them. After Effects is going to excel way more if you need it to be this because in After Effects, you can see the entire waveform on the timeline. The thing that After Effects thinks at is playing it back, but as long as it's visually synchronized with that part of the song, then that'll be where it happens in the render. So, yeah, you're just asking a lot of Blender or any 3D situation at that point, right? Cinema 4D also not great at this. like the the there's so much overhead computationally wise to make the images that then trying to sync it with the audio is like even just for playback is not trivial. Like that's not like audio is in a completely different timing paradigm. There's like 48,000 cycles per uh samples per second, right? And so then you're resolving that with what's going on in the frame rate and you know it's just it's it's a lot for for the rendering environment. >> Is there audio in the video? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. But at that point like if you're just using Blender as the video editor, it probably makes sense to be in After Effects, right? Because I mean the the blender video editor thing is good as we saw last time like you know it's still not after like after effects is literally like 40 years of doing that at this point like I don't know what it is but probably like 99% of music music videos are eventually put together if not whole cloth you know a lot of them and after effects has contributed significantly Yes, >> this may be a really dumb question. Is profanity allowed in the songs? >> Yeah, I mean >> like >> this is a college class. It's in the syllabus that we're going to experience art of all kinds and everyone needs to be prepared for that. I would ask you to use like you're not offending me, okay? But we're all in this together here. So, you know, uh, be responsible, right? Member of the community as far as I is concerned. >> I literally thought that Yeah. Again, like everything we make, the idea is that this is something that goes into your portfolio, right? So, like the my sort of blanket advice, you know, let's because a lot of you you don't do this all the time, but like definitely other students do are like, I'm going to make this thing that intentionally looks really awful and offensive. I'm like, okay, you know, like that's that's a legitimate artistic statement to make. It may not be a very profitable one, right? You know, not that all the art needs to be about making money, but like you ideally you want to spend your time here making something that you can show to other people under most circumstances, right? So, keep keep that in mind. I wouldn't, you know, I was gonna say I wouldn't pick a bunch of two live crew songs, but I mean, do you guys even know who that is? Yeah. Yeah, look it up later. Not at school. >> Cool. All right, great. So, look forward to seeing everybody's stuff on Wednesday. I'm sure we're gonna get some interesting stories and cutaway shots. I'm looking forward to it.

The only thing uh from a modeling standpoint here I might address is you did a good job of like controlling rounding on most of the other surfaces with you know either sub subdurface or you put a bevel here. Although I would probably round that bevel is that this is such a big feature. it really kind of gives away it makes it look a little, you know, cheaper than the other um angles. And so I would, you know, bevel this and the inside here to give that a little bit better um you know, especially because that's going to be a part that's almost certainly catching the light um depending on what direction it's coming from. And so I would do that for there. Um but yeah, mystery solved. Cool. Super cool ship design. And yeah. Yeah, definitely. So, when something gets duplicated like this, um, sometimes we want to have the what Blender is doing there is is the the prefer preferable default behavior in that it does make the UVs overlapped because once they're not overlapped, like trying to overlap them is not can be a pain. And so, um, yeah. And then text tools helps us complete our investigation there. That's a good one. I'll see try that one. See how it stacks up to UV toolkit um for using everything. So here's B. >> Hey, class 185. Good afternoon. Hope everybody's doing well on this grand Wednesday. Of course, those are pre-recorded on Tuesday, but that's nothing bits. All right, so three models I made in Modeler. I made a vent. Um, it was pretty cool to make. Uh, it does not transfer well, so maybe not the best idea, but I made it and it's on the ship. Um, I had to use the auto UV unwrapping cuz Q measure destroys it and even using like 5% 6% of the exporting doesn't do very good either. Um, this is >> so so there like that. Great. This is something where, you know, anything with tiny repeating holes in it like this, especially if this is going to be pretty small on the ship, this these should probably be um you know, just essentially it's a cube with an alpha channel, right? And so instead of Substance Modeler, this is probably something for Substance Painter there, right? Unless this unless this is just going to be really big on there, right? Um, this is just you did a fine job modeling it. It's just that this type of thing here. Um, yeah, >> it's probably also if you're going to want to model it nice if you want to have like at the back because that's what I want to do >> coming out of the great. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, so >> it does not transfer well. So maybe not the best idea, but I made it and it's on the ship. Um, I had to use the auto UV unwrapping because Q measure destroys it and even using like 5% 6% of the exporting doesn't do very good either. Um, this is a tank griel I made. I like this one the most. I think this one came out really awesome. Um, I like the design of it. Well, the symmetry around with the little cutouts, you know, the the little neck and kind of like a capsule. Almost looks like a spaceship itself. And then I made a laser for my pirate ship. So I I like this one, too. Pretty cool. So, but yeah, I think they transferred very well. So, we'll see them here.",
    "transcript_segment": "Mystery solved. >> Cool. The only thing uh from a modeling standpoint here I might address is you did a good job of like controlling rounding on most of the other surfaces with you know either sub subdurface or you put a bevel here. Although I would probably round that bevel is that this is such a big feature. it really kind of gives away it makes it look a little, you know, cheaper than the other um angles. And so I would, you know, bevel this and the inside here to give that a little bit better um you know, especially because that's going to be a part that's almost certainly catching the light um depending on what direction it's coming from. And so I would do that for there. Um but yeah, mystery solved. Cool. Super cool ship design. And yeah. Yeah, definitely. So, when something gets duplicated like this, um, sometimes we want to have the what Blender is doing there is is the the prefer preferable default behavior in that it does make the UVs overlapped because once they're not overlapped, like trying to overlap them is not can be a pain. And so, um, yeah. And then text tools helps us complete our investigation there. That's a good one. I'll see try that one. See how it stacks up to UV toolkit um for using everything. So here's B. >> Hey, class 185. Good afternoon. Hope everybody's doing well on this grand Wednesday. Of course, those are pre-recorded on Tuesday, but that's nothing bits. All right, so three models I made in Modeler. I made a vent. Um, it was pretty cool to make. Uh, it does not transfer well, so maybe not the best idea, but I made it and it's on the ship. Um, I had to use the auto UV unwrapping cuz Q measure destroys it and even using like 5% 6% of the exporting doesn't do very good either. Um, this is >> so so there like that. Great. This is something where, you know, anything with tiny repeating holes in it like this, especially if this is going to be pretty small on the ship, this these should probably be um you know, just essentially it's a cube with an alpha channel, right? And so instead of Substance Modeler, this is probably something for Substance Painter there, right? Unless this unless this is just going to be really big on there, right? Um, this is just you did a fine job modeling it. It's just that this type of thing here.

Laser is still pretty dense, but that was the the lowest I can go without it being destroyed because if you look here, it is still pretty mangled on some of the sharp edges. Even on the tip, some of it's this is a Q measure. Um, and then this is the vent. You can see, you know, coming out. There's like a seam here that's blown up there and here. Uh, the tank didn't do too bad though with the key measure. Uh, yeah, cut the bottoms out of this one and the tank. Um, well, there's like some spots here um here, but I think this one transferred the best. Um, so here is my spaceship with all the gribbles on it showing scale. I put a lot of the mechanical ones on the wing up and underneath. I know we're not supposed to do underneath in space, but you know, you can kind of see, you know, depending on angled, I think I might use this field for my space scene. I think it just looks a little bit stronger than this side. I'm not sure. To me, it is. I don't know. I might be wrong, but I put a tank on both sides of the back, you know, depending on which side I use, you know, just kind of gives it some more depth, the mechanical ones. And then the arrays and antennas. And then here is we'll get rid of all these is my UV editing. So, it's going to be a butt head. So, we'll grab the ship and then go to UV. There we go. So, these are the seams I got. I did sharp edges first and then I went in and did the rest of them like around the wings here. Kind of split those up so they can lay flatter uh around the exhaust of the thrusters and around the little wings that I made in the back and here as well. Oh, but I think it lays pretty flat. Um, fills up the box pretty good. So, there's a little bit of extra space, but not too much. So, yeah, it's pretty much my Reaver ship that I made. Um, so I actually Yeah, I think it came out very well. Yeah, looks great. The the only thing like the the body of the ship has end up kind of box-like. And you know, maybe there's a way to uh you know, either bevel something along here or boolean out something to give, you know, to make sure this side here is not 100% flat. Um that'd be the my main design suggestion there. Um yeah, you got the Millennium Falcon disc on it. Um the just looking at the laser griel once because that one did look pretty heavy. Okay. Yeah, if you had the smoothing on, uh, that may have caused it to not handle those edges too well there. It's just a confusing um situation since this seemed you know if you like the essentially there's a remsh process happening when you export from modeler and you know even if you had to go up to like 10% or something there and when you brought it in over here it was really really um dense than stepping on it here with the Q Remeasure um because I've definitely had better results than this. But now, let me see if I can make this. Well, it's going to have all this junk in it without the without getting access to the original original. And let me see. I don't think I have the modeler files here. I don't see them. These are all the blend files. Um yeah I mean because this is fine. It works for there but um yeah I mean this is one of those things where you know what is uh what is the topology supposed to look like here? This is one of those things where like the actual um sort of like rebuilding it cleanly would end up being something much, you know, easier than what it's trying to do there with the right. And then you know in like 30 seconds I've essentially done a manual rettopology of this, right? And so then this can you just delete the other faces and um then control L and just move this back in there and you'd have something that's a lot cleaner. Um yeah, it's just that in this case, yeah, it did really get very garbagey right there. And so if you you can go back to the original output from substance modeler than making sure that that um I I mean I'd be interested to know if this was on or off. In your case, you would want it off and see if it did a better job at uh detecting what's going on there. But even if not, you can sort of do your own manual rettopo of that part pretty quickly there, right? I mean, especially for something circular like that. Cool. That looks good.

Um, I created my antenna here. Uh, door I was messing around with. Um, I created like a little engine block to go on the back of my engine. Created the wheels with the wings. And then this part for my engine as well. Um, my spaceship. >> This is my spaceship. is the um magic space bus. Um so I have my engine back here. This where the stuff would have went. Um this where of course the antenna would have went. Um this is the views from it. So the UV layout. So here's that tried different things as far as the UV layout. When I would bring it over to painter. It was messing up. Um, but this is right here. And then I have no dribbles because I could have come over. >> So I Let's look at Okay. So yeah, you're on painter. Um, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong as far as when I start painting. Um, it just is not working. Um, I am meeting with Fabio tomorrow. Hopefully, he'll be able to help me out and get that all >> Yeah. So, the crux of the problem here is that, you know, like you got a bunch of overlapping stuff on the UV map and the UV map. I think a bunch of these don't have applied scale. So there's a bunch of um distortion in the UV map. Right? The the tell here was that when we're looking at it this way, we've got these giant, you know, numbers and letters over here. And then if we look at it uh in some other parts here, I already downloaded it. Let's see if we can fix it up. Um here and here. Here. Okay. So, yeah, the let's get out of this. Okay. So, the main ship body, I would take the other things and then shift drag them underneath so that uh we have a hierarchy there. So, holding down shift and let go. Okay, that's better. Now, uh let's do our apply scale. Right. So this is this is also a main issue here, right? You got to get the scale applied on all of these objects. There we go. And this will do a lot to help the UV map. for certain. And here, maybe the Blender add-on I developed should just be like the words apply scale in giant red letters obscure the screen every like minute and a half or something like that. >> A really nice just click in the tool >> and solves all your problems. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we just need a big button and then I can then class will just be click this button, click it again, keep clicking the button. Um, so now let's get things unwrapped. So here this is essentially like a cube like thing. And so our smart UV project here can probably give us a better result. We got these long edges there. But let's just keep going here. Uh, tab out. I'm gonna select all. Oh, no. I just go tab in here and uh you Yeah, I might apply I might combine these. So, there's this and There we go. And so I'd control J all of that stuff. There we go. That's all now one thing in there. And now if I tab in and select everything. A um let's go ahead and again do the U. Um smart UV project. There we go. That lines everything up. Although actually when I applied J when I did control J this got messed up and now this doesn't look right. So again tab out control uh control A scale tab U. There we go. Now that looks correct. We see that we get yeah reasonably sized re, you know, distributed numbers. These are still way too big here. We'll get to this in a second. So let's tab out of here. And now select there we go. Um, looks like you got some stuff that's duplicated here. What's going on with this? This is off of here. There we go. Scales applied. U smart UV project. There we go. So since yours is mostly cube like here. We may be able to speed up the process by let me tab out. Grab everything. How is this not selected? and we might be able to unwrap it all at the same time using smart UV project, which in your case does project everything. Where are these things? Because they're not showing up over here. Ah, they're all underneath here. So this whole thing should be combined. So just some part management here. Control J. There we go. Now that's all together. Now I can tab in and U. That lays that out for us. And so now, let's see where we're at. There's the wing thruster. Still some stuff in the thruster. What else is in there? That looks good. And let's just make sure that things are not inside and out. Everything's inside out. So, we don't want any red here, right? So again, we can grab all of it and tab in. And let's go to layout mesh normals. Recalculate outside. There we go. Flip our normals. And let's again turn it on here. I think you got some overlapping. Yeah, I think you kind of extruded something back into itself there with these, which is why we still have red over here. and go control L and just just get rid of these for now. So, how are we doing here? Better. And if we look at the UV editing, this front part here still a little confusing. So, your smart UV project here is going to be your friend for this one, Thomas, in that it would actually get a lot of this straightened out um in a way that's going to work. So, a U and unwrap. There we go. Right. So, when you look at this, it should look like the pieces of that. Right. And if it doesn't, then something something has gone arry. Now we've got relatively equally distributed geometry and something that now when it gets exported for Substance Painter it should make sense. Let's see. Or substance painter will at least at least you know work. Me uh it'll at least have you have a fighting chance here. There we go. And oh, still all one texture set. So the other part that you missed here, this will be fine. You just want to give a separate material to each part. Then you'll be good to go because our parts over don't have overlapping UVs. Um, it's just the does the thruster thruster looks like it has a lot of problems. I mean, I deleted a bunch of it, but we still got some things. I might go back and sort of reconceive of this part. Um, but yeah. So, what's your checklist of things? Make sure you got face orientation on so you can see if any of the stuff is inside out. You can tell it's inside out because it's face, you know, red. Um, in which case you need to mesh recalculate normals with all of the faces selected. Then you need to, you know, run the um, smart UV unwrap. In this case, U ededit a U smart UV to project. That'll unwrap the whole thing. And then you need to add a separate material labeled with each thing so that when you come in here to Substance Painter, those same names should show up here. So, so some more work to do there. So, we got the shapes in place. Just got a little bit of cleaning up here to do. And then in terms of Substance Modeler, you didn't make some things. What was the deal here? Maybe they're all on the same layer. We just want to export one at a time. So I just have this one selected. We need to define that group which is just that thing. There we go. Actually, this is going to be way too high. Let's just set it to maybe about there. There we go. And this should be something that we can bring in somewhere here. Yeah, there it is. So, can scale this up to what we would need. Make sure that we then, you know, put it wherever you would want it to go on the ship at that point. Yeah, that's so those I mean I think maybe you're trying to export them all at one time and getting some bad results and you want to do them each as a group. And so again then here select one and define group. There we go. Then select the group then export the asset. Okay, that's coming along. Here is",

As I don't have Substance Modeler, I'm showing you in Blender. I decided to create an engine, this an antenna, a vent, and a panel. I mainly did it because I couldn't really think of anything else. I feel like these could just fit on most ships. So yeah, this is my ship with the greybles attached to it. >> Yeah, that's nice. It kind of gives me the vibes of the >> transport ship from the opening of 1977 Star Wars. >> And then the engines here. Um, it's a cargo ship. This is where the cargo goes, obviously. This is the UV of it. The UV layout. Um, not really sure if it's good or not. I mean, it seems like we don't have overlapping things there, but the main way to answer that question is to have the mesh checker material on there. that gives you a way to definitively investigate the quality of your UVs because yeah, without that, especially when you're starting off, there might be it's completely reasonable that you're like, I don't know, is this good? Seems good. Doesn't seem good. I have no idea. Um, and so can we open Tommy's spaceship here? This is still the other one. You You guys both named your spaceship spaceship space ship. Um, let me delete the other one. Why is this happening his spaceship? That's really weird. Here it is. What? Okay, one more time. All these files must be taking up a lot of space. >> I I I delete them every once in a while. I need after this class there needs to be another mass deleting. I agree with me. >> Oh. Oh, they are. There we are. Okay. So, investigating your UVs over here and then here. I have no What is going on here? That all looks good. I'm having some kind of add-on meltdown here. There we go. So with UV toolkit installed this one. There we go. You can say color grid and 2048 and boom. Now you have some way to make a decision about this. If you see a bunch of stuff flashing like this, that's also not a good sign. What is that? Uh, what's going on here? >> Z fighting. All the faces were Z fighting, right? like kung fu fighting except for polygons. Um, and so here, what is this giant thing here? Let's see. >> Oh, great. I'll put it ear. >> Mhm. Okay, that looks like the bottom of it. Let's see. Um, yep, we have that applied. If we were to unwrap that, that gives us a little bit better work. The other issue here is let's make sure the normal is all right. And I think if we come back here and look at this, we'll see some red on this probably right here. Here. And what's going on here? You're still seeing that happening there. My first um technique to fix this is merge the vertices and see if that something got duplicated here. See if it collapses it down. So go to vertex mode, right click and say pressed A to grab all of them. Merge by distance. I think that may have helped there. I'm not seeing that flickering. And if we come back over here, let's see if we still see it. Yeah, definitely. What is going on here? Why can't I click on this face? Okay. What is just a part of this? Okay. So, this is essentially all of it in there. I'm going to decrease the distance here a little bit. And that looks like it fused some things together. the other thing. So, it's hard to tell what the distance is that you need there sometimes. >> I don't know. There's no modifiers. A modifier that might clean this up is the weld, which is kind of like the other one. So it does have a smaller has a larger default distance. And so here it is without. So it's off and we're getting Z fighting here. We turn it on, the Z fighting goes away, right? Because it's welded everything together within this distance here. And so but now we would need to apply this modifier. So control uh tab out uh convert to mesh. There we go. And so now if we do another unwrap here. Yeah. So unwrapping it yourself gives you some weird because it's very box-like. And so in this case, again, like it was with uh the other Thomas' ship, the smart UV project is not doing a whole lot of damage here. It's just allowing us the the thing that's probably causing a lot of the problems here is like there's some piece of large empty parts here that I can't quite put my finger on. But that seems to at least give us some sort of idea. So we're looking what how do we evaluate the UVs? We look at it and now the numbers and letters are roughly the same size going over the whole thing. I don't see any sections where the numbers and letters are drastically different which is good. And this looks okay. Right. So the you had those weird shaped things that were like this on here, which is a bad sign because if you look over here, there's no weird shaped things, right? This is primarily box-like. And so what we're seeing over here should also be box-like in that. So the fix here was adding that weld modifier and then applying it. Um that's probably it's doing the same thing as the merge by distance except it gives you a slider you can drag up and down until you've merged what you need to merge. The only danger there is it might get rid of some detail. But if we come back here and look at these. Okay. Duplicated those. That looks okay. And so does that. I think you're on your way here. And yeah, no weird scales. Everything's at one. We've got that sorted out now. Over here. That's all good. This should be paintable now. At this point, I would export this and you'll be in a place to go. Yeah, your UV maps don't have overlapping faces, so we'll be able to make that work. You know, these might be better if they were laid flat if you cut a seam in them, but this will work for now. Okay, so a bunch of changes there, Tommy, you're on the stream there. Did that make sense? Right. grabbing the main part of the ship here and using that weld modifier and applying it and then redoing the UV unwrap with the smart UV project gives us gets us cleaned up in a way that's going to work there. Right. So, like the other Thomas' ship, very box-like, smart UV project works really pretty decently for that kind of thing, right? Because that's what it's doing. It's projecting in from all six sides of a cube in order to lay the whole thing flat. In your case, that makes a lot of sense. Cool. Okay, let's see. That was Thomas. Isabella, is there a video in here? Isabella, you're zipping everything up and you were in the class last semester when I asked everyone to do that.

So this is something you know maybe I think next semester when we do this assignment we'll do like a blender griel a substance model gribble and then a combo gribble. This would be a combo greble right because making this like smooth stair step thing with these things coming out that's all taking advantage of what substance modeler has to offer. making this array of cubes.

But sometimes you can't figure out what you're going to make until you're in there messing around. And so this, you know, if you got to this end point creatively, then you could take a step back at the end of the process and be like, yeah, substance modeler lets me like really freewheel while I'm improvising and putting parts together. But now just the, you know, the quoteunquote rettopizing of this is just essentially deleting these out of modeler and then just making an array of cubes in Blender and at joining it into the piece, right? So you know retology in the easiest sense of the word then get to this in a second my yeah without the bolts this makes sense as a modeler part because there's like a lot of lot there would be a lot of management of stuff here for you know these circular things and certainly some of this control gable I removed the bottoms each one And let's fast forward a little bit here. >> That's pretty much it for my spaceship in Blender.

So this I I think you unwrapped everything well. It's just that you didn't do the step of assigning a separate material to each grieel. I think because you've got, you know, more than four greles, right? And so that's this is the sure sign there. So back here in Blender, yeah, separate one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine different materials, nine different texture sets. That way you won't have that overlapping and you'll be able to paint them distinctly. That's the only place you went wrong because it does look like you're unwrapping things. Well, it's just that they're Yeah, you're not going to be able to bake until you get that straightened out because it's just going to bake a bunch of junk on top of other junk there.

And then I will use the gables the dribbles to break that symmetry. Okay, let's see the map for the spaceship. So, I started with like using like the smart UV project and then I think it did a decent job and then after that I added some seams here in this part because they weren't looking good here. And then I think that was all I did with the spaceship with the U map of the spaceship. So let's see here in sub painter I already made the mesh and I think it looks nice. >> Yeah, that baked really well there. You got the ambient occlusion in there. >> And then you can see here all the >> Yeah, you can label these now. here. >> Will the mesh have a different texture set and I think that's all for this week. Thanks for watching. >> Hey, >> cool. Did you Let's see here. Which"

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Model Kit Inspired Gribbles Hey, this is Jack with ABC185 and we're going to be looking at everything we did this week. Is the first group I made in Modeler. I kind of just took inspiration for for all of the ones I'm about to show. I took inspiration from just like looking at different uh modeling kits online, like just all of their uh components and just kind of like putting my own twist on uh on some of the parts. So, trying to make a vague sci-fi model. We've got this uh ebox here. Um when it actually got into Blender, these like buttons disappeared. Again, just another like random thing to give it some some extra stuff. Looks vaguely like something useful or something. So, this panel here, again, same sort of thing. just a vague useful looking uh object. Yeah, I tried to keep it somewhat simple for a lot of these, but also tried to take advantage of of Substance Modeler. And then here are here's my last one. This is these are like pipes. Um this is the only one that I had issues with like bringing into Blender. I think it's all of these like divots. >> Yeah. Yeah. Same thing like made it really uh weird to like average where the lines are. Those are my the four models I made in Modeler. All right. So, yeah, here's that disc here. Um I got rid of the bottom. Yeah, most of these I did the smart projection. For this one, I did um mark seams and everything. Uh here's the Ebox. This turned out nice. I didn't get rid of the bottom. I probably should have, but uh I didn't. Yeah, it's taking up like all this space right there. So, uh yeah, I probably should have got rid of that, but uh that's okay. I mean, these aren't going to be like Yeah, I mean, they're not going to be super in your face. case smaller things. Got the panel here. Again, I'm pretty sure this was smart projected. I did I did get rid of the bottom though. Yeah, it's not super detailed, but um I think it works. I think it works. Here's the pipes. So, yeah, the pipes are giving me some trouble sometimes. There's definitely like something weird going on right here. Yeah, it's funny like the things that would be not hard to do traditionally, right? Like a inset and inner extrude, right? Uh are the things that give it a lot of problems here. Um which is interesting. Hopefully the out Yeah, I don't know. The merge vertices isn't really working. That's it. unwrapped a lot of circles and stuff, but uh pretty sure that's a lot of these um >> and then yeah, like this one. Yeah, like maybe you created this shape in Substance Mer, but then like really uh an extrude uh a curve with, you know, a beveled curve and then some cuts and extrudes would get you there in a super clean way. >> Circular object in general. All right. So, here are the various uh like versions of my ship. I guess this is like the earliest blockout right here. A little more detail and a little more detail. Yeah, this is Yeah, this is the final asymmetrical version. And then we've got the placed greblies on it. Uh I had trouble like deciding where to put stuff. I did not uh put any manual seams because I was having a lot of trouble just like making it all work and um I ended up just going for the cube projection. One of the reasons why it was difficult to mark good seam placements in the first place is because I applied the bevel to everything already. And so it was just um Yeah. Uh >> yeah. And it looked like you did three for the bevel, right? So that that also makes that >> that's what all of these random bits are just random bevels. So um yeah, there's this long lining. This is the um this front right here spewed out in a line. So uh not the greatest. I think it's okay. Um, yeah, I tried to play around with the scaling of of different objects. I wasn't intending to make like a huge ship. Like this is supposed to be kind of like a smaller like personal size ship. A lot of the objects are pretty large, big enough for a person to like interact with them. So yeah, this is everything in Substance Painter. Um, I decided to yeah, I played around with the different like resolutions. Yeah, so like the bigger things like this antenna right here has 2048 and then everything else I did 1024 besides the vents as well. and the tanker. So, yeah, like the the biggest things I gave 2048, everything else I did 1024. So, um, >> and it seems to be running okay with the ship at 4096 >> cuz they're pretty small. I think it works. And you could always bump the textures up later. So, but yeah, and I did the thing where we Yeah, you put more emphasis on the ambient occlusion and uh I think it I think it looks nice right now. Thank you and goodbye. >> Yeah, you got it in there. That's good. Um, yeah, that, uh, I like this one a lot. That one's super cool. And then, uh, yeah, I mean, if these these end up being really small, so that's going to be, you know, sort of covered up by that. Um, yeah, I I like it a lot. the just the you know if anything um yeah just sort of the the cubicness of of these like extrusions of the part you know like same thing I was talking about with bows uh trying to make you know it's box modeling so you're starting off with a cube and then doing stuff but then you kind of want to get away from the cube at some point right and so doing doing something there but I And the this is looking pretty good. The other sort of design thing is like this being curved and then that being square, right? Like like having it having the shape sort of come out from that. But it kind of reminds me of the drop ship from Ali Aliens, which you haven't seen. Um, it has a cockpit kind of like that. Just typing in all caps. Aliens drop ship. Only I could see that. So I just seem like a maniac now. Um, >> yeah, it's a cool movie. >> Yeah. >> And there's a there's a bunch of ships, you know, in the same world kind of inspired by this. In the new alien TV show as well, the alien earth, we see a bunch of sim very similar kind of things flying around on Earth. But yeah, um, good. And yeah, the baking looks like that worked out really well. You got no UV issues because you've got separate, uh, UV spaces, texture sets for all of the things. Look at this labeling stuff. Um, yeah. So we got greoids, we got griees, we got grie balls, we got all of the the grees. >> You're very gravy. and and gosh, why are these videos not showing up?",

And so then this and the key parts are the, you know, 2 thou 4,000 by 2,000 or maybe 6,000 by 3,000, right? um to give you enough uh to you know wrap around to use and load in there. And then um yeah, open EXR is going to be the least compressed format here. And having it in float full is going to give us the full thing. I think that should be fine. Yeah, >> you just go to world. >> Yeah, load loaded the same way you do any other HDR. Yeah, exactly. Sound good? All right, let's call it."

    "video_id": "VQde6J4qt1o",
    "search_text": "AVC200 October 22, 2025 Multiple Texture Sets Workflow um this is another good one. Everyone should write this down. Multiple texture sets in substance painter equal multiple materials. This is this is the equivalence you need to mentally internalize both in both directions. Going from Blender to Substance Painter and going from Substance Painter back to Blender. When we if we put more than one material on different parts of our mesh or meshes when we export them from Blender, they'll become separate texture sets in Substance Painter. the you want to do that sparingly. If you can make your whole thing one material, that's the most performant way to do it. But in in instances like this where we have, you know, two totally separate things, the skeleton and the hat and the clothes, it makes sense to have separate materials here. So um you know Bo had a separate material which he labeled correctly um hat Morai tar um and those came in as separate materials. The issue with this is that when you go to paint things like this, you're the layer stack is completely distinct to each material, which is good because that means each each thing is going to get its uh maximum amount of resolution. But um often you want to have similar stuff in each texture set. In this case, for sure with the hat and the clothing, right? Probably the hat and the clothing could have been just one texture set, but it's fine. The So there's two different ways to do this. one, you can just copy and paste from, not pasty, paste from one um texture set to another. And the second way that you can do this is that you can put the layer in a folder, save the folder as a smart material, and then apply to any texture set. So those are your two options when you want to have similar stuff in different texture sets. [Music] So for instance uh I could grab metal polished here. Crl + C, go to this part and CtrlV and move this up and it pastes the material. But in this case, this was you like several materials with a relationship between them. Uh so we need to the thing that we didn't copy and paste here was what what was not contained in this lay this layer. What's that? >> The anchor point, right? And so you would need to reestablish the anchor point over here. And then up here, read the anchor point. And then we're good. So, um, yeah, and the other option here, uh, if we had to do this, that's, you know, in this instance, that's clearly the preferred easy technique. Um, the other option would be perhaps um, packaging this up as a smart material. So, it needs to be in a folder. You need to make a folder. Call this uh metal filigree. Sure, that's how you spell filigree. And then you put this in there. And then you right click on it and say create smart material. And then it um puts it over here. I don't know why the icon doesn't look quite right. Probably because it's reading a mask or something. Um, and then if I need to bring this in over here, I can bring this in like so. And then all that stuff is there. And so now I could just, you know, on a much more bigger thing, a much larger thing with many, many, many texture sets, then that would be a quick way to easily populate things across the texture sets, right? Because that's the um downside of having multiple texture sets is that you can't sort of paint across the texture sets like that. Um, so that makes sense. The only other thing here is like this line. Um, could we use that as well here to do outlining perhaps? Um so here I want to also grab this information and so the information is coming from here in this mask. I'll make another anchor point. This is accent mask. How do I get both anchor points in here? I would need to add another fill effect. Bring this down like so. And read the other anchor point which is accent. Now, um, I've achieved one thing and lost the other. How do I combine these? I need to think blend modes, right? And so, they're reading mask information. And this is regular mask information. So, it's white content on black. And so, we need to have the whites combine. And so, which blend mode do we need here? we need to brighten the one below with the one above. And so that's going to be in our um add family, right? Just like in every program, the blend modes are divided by families. And so the multiply one is always going to be darkening, right? So, if you need to black out more of something, the ads or brightenings are all going to be together. In this case, Substance Painter is a little bit different in that for some reason they don't want to call it AD. They want to call it parenthesis AD with linear dodge. Um, and so these are all together and then um different algorithms over here. And so again, you can make most of your money just by understanding, you know, this the multiply family is going to darken, the add family is going to brighten. That's most of the time. And then the diff the other ones here in the group going to be slightly different versions of that. But um let's do that. And bada. Now we've done it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Only the people online get that, you know, experience. Um, yeah, because now remember up here looking at the at the channels by themselves can be very helpful when you're when you're figuring this stuff out because sometimes it's really hard to visualize what's happening when you're looking at all of it together, especially with something that's not color. So, if you go to mask here and so if I cut this back to normal, right? There's what we had before. And so now, if I were to That's that mask. That's that mask. But when I turn it on, this one is covering up this one. And so I need this white to be added on top. And so we go to add. Now we have both of them, right? And you can see exactly what is happening there. Make sense? Okay. Uh, great. Okay. And it looks like your um rigging there is also ahead of the game. So, that's great. All right. And keep the keep the kilt. Here is I download the videos individually here. This way you can Here's",
    "transcript_segment": "um this is another good one. Everyone should write this down. Multiple texture sets in substance painter equal multiple materials. This is this is the equivalence you need to mentally internalize both in both directions. Going from Blender to Substance Painter and going from Substance Painter back to Blender. When we if we put more than one material on different parts of our mesh or meshes when we export them from Blender, they'll become separate texture sets in Substance Painter. the you want to do that sparingly. If you can make your whole thing one material, that's the most performant way to do it. But in in instances like this where we have, you know, two totally separate things, the skeleton and the hat and the clothes, it makes sense to have separate materials here. So um you know Bo had a separate material which he labeled correctly um hat Morai tar um and those came in as separate materials. The issue with this is that when you go to paint things like this, you're the layer stack is completely distinct to each material, which is good because that means each each thing is going to get its uh maximum amount of resolution. But um often you want to have similar stuff in each texture set. In this case, for sure with the hat and the clothing, right? Probably the hat and the clothing could have been just one texture set, but it's fine. The So there's two different ways to do this. one, you can just copy and paste from, not pasty, paste from one um texture set to another. And the second way that you can do this is that you can put the layer in a folder, save the folder as a smart material, and then apply to any texture set. So those are your two options when you want to have similar stuff in different texture sets. [Music] So for instance uh I could grab metal polished here. Crl + C, go to this part and CtrlV and move this up and it pastes the material. But in this case, this was you like several materials with a relationship between them. Uh so we need to the thing that we didn't copy and paste here was what what was not contained in this lay this layer. What's that? >> The anchor point, right? And so you would need to reestablish the anchor point over here. And then up here, read the anchor point. And then we're good. So, um, yeah, and the other option here, uh, if we had to do this, that's, you know, in this instance, that's clearly the preferred easy technique. Um, the other option would be perhaps um, packaging this up as a smart material. So, it needs to be in a folder. You need to make a folder. Call this uh metal filigree. Sure, that's how you spell filigree. And then you put this in there. And then you right click on it and say create smart material. And then it um puts it over here. I don't know why the icon doesn't look quite right. Probably because it's reading a mask or something. Um, and then if I need to bring this in over here, I can bring this in like so. And then all that stuff is there. And so now I could just, you know, on a much more bigger thing, a much larger thing with many, many, many texture sets, then that would be a quick way to easily populate things across the texture sets, right? Because that's the um downside of having multiple texture sets is that you can't sort of paint across the texture sets like that. Um, so that makes sense. The only other thing here is like this line. Um, could we use that as well here to do outlining perhaps? Um so here I want to also grab this information and so the information is coming from here in this mask. I'll make another anchor point. This is accent mask. How do I get both anchor points in here? I would need to add another fill effect. Bring this down like so. And read the other anchor point which is accent.

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Mr. Peppermint Character Gavin. >> Hi everybody. This is Gavin. So I'm just going to tell you about Mr. Peppermint here. Um, so firstly, I added a little bit of a little bit more topology to his arms cuz it didn't have enough before. Now it probably has too much. But I wanted to make sure at least the arms had the most because they'll be bending the most. >> So, how did you do this? >> I added a few loop cuts to the subdivision the modifier and then I applied it. The subdivision surface modifier. Is that what it's called? >> I mean, that's what it's called. I'm not sure if that's what you used, but you know. Yeah, that's what you Okay. So like that's you know like that's a little bit of doing the same thing twice right in that the loop cuts add more topology and then you're subdividing the loop cuts are getting you more like I mean the amount of topology here in terms of like along the arm looks pretty good. I mean depends how much elbow mobility Mr. Peppermint has here in terms you know because that's where the stretching would be happening right is here. Um, and so, you know, if we had to nitpick, not adding the extra loop cuts on the cuff seems kind of, you know, that seems a little at that point it's getting kind of dense, but it'll be fine. Your looks good. >> Same with the hands. So, I think it kind of >> I mean, in this case, we haven't seen I've done whatever I needed to do to make everyone wary of having too much topology. We haven't seen someone yet who's like just got a really hyper dense character. Most of you have been, you know, erroring erroring on the side of it being not dense enough to actually animate, right? So, this will be fine. >> Balances out with how other things are like not as much vertices like the body. And I also added some more vertices to the hat. So, this is more even instead of long rectangle. And everything is quads, too. So that's good. At least uh there's no triangles. Um so originally, uh I did UV unwrap in Blender, but every time I did, um there would just be a few little visual like annoying things. Like there like for example, there'd be like little gray like area up here when I'd bring it into here and it would and no matter what you did, it wouldn't go away. So I I I just decided, you know, try unwrapping it in in Substance Painter, and it ended up working way better. So I just kept it. Even though this might not look as good, it still got the job done. Um, so originally the game was going to be like a rough like a tune shading type thing, and it still is, but I wanted to try to see what if the what if Mr. Peppermint only him was textured much more nicely than some of the other stuff cuz I think it would just make him stand out more and plus it was just fun to play around with. Like I think it just looks more visually interesting than if he doesn't have it. Like I don't know. I just Yeah, I just think it looks better. And then but anyway um so it definitely Yeah, it absolutely looks different. looks better here in this view as we're looking at it, right? Um the things to consider going forward would be once we're in the game, like how is that going to look compared to everything else? And then if the there's this really tiny high frequency detail on the suit here, right? not the big stripes, but the like uh weave texture that uh depending on how big he is in the scene and how close the camera is to him, that may look kind of flickery depending on depending on those two things. So, something to consider, but you've got options there. What else did I just turn off? Whatever. Uh, for the stripes, the stripes were really interesting because I I didn't want to do it manually. So, I found a way I found like a stripes texture here. And then I tried different ways of displaying it on and I actually used spherical projection here and I positioned it in a way to where it it's above him and it actually perfectly does what I wanted to. So, I'm very pleased with that. And then the eyes I gave some emission to because I just think ultimately like in the renders here, this is when I brought it into Blender. I think it'll just make him stand out more. And his eyes are the most important part of his character anyway. Like that's what you're going to look at the most. So, I think that works well. And lastly, I just want to say like I even went in and painted some a little bit of like gray gradients on some of the parts where they connect to add more depth. So >> underarm sweat, >> you can interpret that as that. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As the game goes on, that shader just starts to expand. >> Yeah. Deodorant and uh antipersprint are two of your power-ups. You're giving me >> Has anyone played um Powerwash Simulator? >> Yes. >> Yeah. >> Uh yeah. No, this looks really great. The like especially here with the nice substance pan glow. The eyes look cool. I mean, it kind of I don't know. It's I think it's great. We'll see what it looks like in the thing. It kind of like reads as like he has like some kind of like superpower to me with his eyes glowing like that. But, you know, that's maybe I'm just watching too much of that stuff. Um, but we if you're going to have if you're going to take the time to set up emission, which you did, um, you know, emission on the end of the scar would make sense to me because that's how cigars work. Um, and then yeah, you're in order to get that, you know, striped suit look. I mean, I think part of the um look is the stripes going down, right? This is like the wood um texture direction, wood grain direction we're talking about with the staff is that this is the suit version of the same issue. Uh and so yeah, you've got the stripes going the right way on the body, but then with the arms, you that would be my only other suggestion here. And so that would end up being.",

So, um, making a mask just for the arms, which I don't think is going to be difficult because they're a discrete, at least a discrete UV island, right? Um, and so you can mask those out with the same material and then change the projection on that part. So here, okay. So help me out here. Also, how about labeling your layers? >> How about it? Huh? >> I will. >> Are you looking for the stripes? >> Yeah. >> I That's like the one one of the few things I didn't >> Okay, there it is. Okay. Okay. So, here um if we duplicate this So, duplicate layer. There it is. Stripes. And we'll label this stripes arms. And we'll change it for the time being to try planer. Um, and now we want to just have the arms here. And so I'm going to right click on this and clear this mask. And then um come over here to our polygon fill. I'll use mesh fill here at first and just click here and here. And so if we just look at the mask, I believe it should show us just the arms now. Yes. So I just masked in the arms there, right? And now I come back to material. And so um changing the rotation on the trip planer would be one way to go about it or perhaps in this case cylindrical because these are pretty much cylinders but then again um rotating Let me put is see he kind of skewed or is it this thing? Um, tiling on set. There we go. Try and get this lined up. Right. So that that cylinder there represents the you know the aforementioned cylindrical projection. Um and so there we go. Now, what if we tiled some more? Okay, now we have that. Let's put get them going the other direction. There we go. And then if we don't want you know that there we can then um come into this mask right click and add a paint effect and so that we don't we'll edit right because this part was generated with the mesh select. And so we want to deselect this inner part of the cuff. And so we need to paint black into the mask. And so if we come back up here to paint and come in here and do this on here >> there >> if I can find his arms. Let's see here. >> I think that circle. >> Yeah, the white in the top right. >> Okay. Well, then maybe we can just do this in UV chunk and this needs to be in multiply. Let me see. It's not doing what I want it to be doing mask. Maybe it's the other one. Okay. So, that's masking that out, but it's going to show whatever is underneath. It's probably showing the other material here. But if we just turn those off, you might need some other layer underneath to sort of, you know, be the black in there. Yeah, it's just showing the regular gray, but you could edit that there from them. But, uh, yeah, that's making him look like he just goes to a better tailor, right? Because pants, same thing, right? You don't stripes that go this way on pants, like that's not a it's not a thing, right? Unless you unless you're like a clown or something, right? Not not these dapper gentlemen here in the suit.

Um, and so you want to do that. You want to apply the mirror modifier then unwrap. >> Okay? Because this is this is because like yeah, this is the front, this is the back, and then this is like that part of the side. And so that's only half. You want to actually make all of the geometry real by applying the mirror modifier. So it's all there. Then unwrap that. here >> on the arms and the leg >> character in Blender. >> Although we're not seeing them on the UV map here. Is there a separate are there like child objects here? >> Um otherwise. >> Okay. Well, then yeah, then apply the mirror modifier. Then go back and do the UV unwrap. >> Nothing else really to see in here. So, I'll just go right to >> although I got I mean this you you painted it, right? >> Yeah, I'm about to show that. >> Okay. Export the modifiers get applied, right? This is something that's coming up in some of the other classes as well. Everybody understand that modifiers are Blender only, right? It's just here. And so when you export stuff, the subdivision surface modifier, the mirror, all of the modifiers get applied. The only thing that gets exported in terms of the mesh is the edges, points, faces, UVs. It all gets boiled down into that raw data. None of the procedural algorithmic stuff like subdividing or mirroring or any of the modifiers. So that's that's a key concept to understand when you go back and forth between the programs. the best like even even having them import the raw data from one program to another program can often present an number of issues, right? Much less like having the subdivision surface modifier work the same in Houdini as it does in Blender, right? Because those pe those engineers have designed it in their own not exactly the same and so it doesn't do that. So you got to understand that when you export it to go over to Substance Painter, then everything gets applied, which is fine in this case because essentially half of um when you when you exported it, the UV all of the geometry got realized because the because it was mod um the modifier was applied, but the UV islands were doubled. And so it's like the left and the right side will just be sitting on top of each other in the UV map. And so when Landon draws an eye for Bugle here, it'll automatically appear on the other side because this is the UV map. The this is the unwrapped face of both the left and the right side. I told you that we don't want overlapping UVs in our UV map 90% of the time, but sometimes in instances like this where if you need complete symmetry, that's fine. Or if you have some sort of repeated element like a leaf that you want to paint and not have taking up a ton of space on the UV map, that would be another instance where you would overlap the UVs. sub to exported the FBX of this character and then went to Substance put it substance painter and started like putting on textures and painting it. Here's what I got so far. Use the green for the most of the body and this for the texture for the face. And I use just a paintbrush of like one of like these one of these textures like here for the face. I just painted it on. Yeah. So, here's that character. >> Also, some labeling, please. >> Might want to change some things. Might want to redo the face. So, like make it look better, like more efficient, like more better.

So yeah, of course I'm very much a beginner just to substance painter. So I'm still figuring it out. I might probably might to make some of the changes I want to make. Like I want to make the antennas and the feet a darker color I planned. might have to look back at some of the lectures or of like painting stuff in this substance painter and then also just do research to learn more about it. Like I know it's like Yeah. Like I know it's like I tried to like paint like the this top part with the sphere on the antennas and the feet but yeah I tried but can't I feel like there's something I have to do I have to look back changing. >> I mean in that case what you're just doing I think this is being covered up by this right. So this remember this is this is essentially Photoshop rules and so on top is on top and so this if you move this up in the stack above that then you would see the paint over top of it. >> Each things add a little more to this. But here's what I got so far starting this program. >> Okay, good. And so yeah, so move thi this is like kind of the base and so that would probably be at the bottom so that everything else can appear over top of it. And then the other thing is that you label things especially the face separately because we're going to need to export that separately later on. Okay. >> Okay. >> All right. Um good start.

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Robot Character Topology Here's Crimson. >> Hi, it's Crimson and this is my UV unwrapped character. >> So, here's my updated typology and I think overall this is probably like my best looking typology of all my models. So, I'm pretty proud of that. Pretty much what I did is I just kept Oh, my stuff is freaking out. There we go. Um, pretty much I just kept track of the way my typology was looking as I was making the model. So, when I was done with it, >> so I think you're conflating two words. This is topology. T O P O L O G Y. And then typography is a separate one. T Y P E >> T Y P >> O G >> G R A P. >> It wouldn't like jump scare me and look really ugly. Um, I made sure for all the objects that had more like rounded edges like the arms and the hook and all that that I made sure I put the seams on them so that way it would just make it flat instead of being a bunch of weird squares. This is way easier to manage than the way it looked before. Um, the big like boxes for like the chest, the head, and the uh hips don't really have it on there cuz I didn't really need it. Um, one thing that I didn't realize I definitely should have done before I put it in Substance Painter is the chest piece right here and the hat. Um, I should have made them way bigger on um my UV maps because this is the hat and it's all small right there. But I'm planning on having like I need to have the skull. So, the skull is now like low pixel and so is the little mark detail on the chest. Those are both um pixelated compared to like the face, which I made sure had um more which I made sure was bigger so that I could put more detail in. I forgot that the hat had that detail and the chest had that detail or I would have changed that. The only reason I hadn't gone back and done it is because um you're not going to be facing the front for this character. You're mainly going to be playing it from like this angle. So you can't really see that detail. And if you see it briefly or if it's in motion like this, you can't really notice. So that's why I hadn't fixed that. Whoops. So I'm for my game, I'm planning on it being just like flat shaded or toune shaded. So I didn't really worry about textures because I feel like the textures made it all just like look wrong cuz my RE is very simple and I like just like the simple flat kind of look. So, here's the the base colors just so you can see it better. Looks a little crazy on here, but I really liked the uh the masking. It really helped make all like the little pieces and segments not be messy. And the symmetry tool to get his face right. Yeah. Overall, I'm I'm pretty proud of this and I'm excited to rig it and all that. Thank you. >> Okay, so yeah, I mean I like the paint work here. Um, but yeah, this and this are super blurry because of uh the UV map there. And so let's just see um I don't think is this Vorso. Um there would be a bunch of issues with fixing this. So the main issue as to why the Jolly uh Jolly Roger, right? Is that right? The pirate flag name. I think so. All of a sudden in my mind, Jolly Roger and Johnny Walker are being conflated. Um, is that yeah, there's not very much uh pixel density here because this is really small on the UV map and then also here, right? We can tell this that's what the grid is telling us. When the numbers are really big on the grid here, it means that it is small over here, right? So the first level of adjusting this would be to um normalize the island size so that this what's big here is big here. And so if I grab everything uh here control A or just hit A and then UV average island scale. There we go. Now you see that these got much bigger because they'll get more um more area. And so now um what else is an issue here? >> Yeah, we have some distortion here. >> It was also the lightning bolt. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, this gives us some more there. Let's see. Um, actually, the reason this still doesn't look great is because >> what's wrong? scale was not applied. >> Scale was not applied, right? And so this is another one where that applying scale in Blender is going to get you. Um so when we average the island scale, it averaged them according to their scale values here. And so we need to um [Music] What happened to all of my add-ons? The add-on situation here is very strange. Things keep going away. We'll control J and then control a scale. There we go. Now you can see how that immediately changed some stuff here because if we look back over here and tab and a um over here we go. Did I miss something? Oh yeah, this stuff here. Control J again. Now grab everything. Now run that algorithm. Average island scale. Aha. Consistent pixel density across the entire thing. But this is a mess. So Alec, what do we need to do to fix this? What what do we need to do to fix this where everything's all overlapping? Yeah, pack. So, come in here. Pack islands. Boom. Um, also this seam here on the hat, this is kind of exactly not where we would want it, right? So, especially for something that goes down the middle, right? When you unwrap faces, you don't put the seam down the middle of the face, right? And so that's, you know, probably not a great choice here. And so we could fix that also fairly easily like this. And loop select this, right click and say uh clear seam. And then grab this one and say mark seam. And that'll give us the No, that goes around that way. That's not quite what we want. I kind of want it around the edge. Maybe that's not I want to retapologize the hat right now, but let's look. There we go. That gives us the top and bottom of the hat to lay flat. And see if that goes around the whole way. There we go. Now it does. There we go. And so let's do it one more time. Um, view unwrap. There we go. And then average island scale pack islands. There we go. All right. And this is uh robot. And let's export robot. [Music] Then back over here, if we open that one up, this is what we're getting around to here. the when we replace the mesh here, there's going to be some problems, but um I think some of it may be okay if we start to look. Okay, because this is all painted and this is painted and nothing's labeled. Kind of a recurring theme here, everybody. um the project configuration, right? Instead of starting over um file, we'll replace this one with the new one. Don't unwrap. We'll fix the normals. There's some inverted ones there. Let's look here. There we go. All right. Come back over here. Try one more time. So, project configuration window allows us to update the mesh. There we go. So, this is what I'm trying to communicate here is that um there's a handful of things that need to be updated here. But you see like the the important thing to understand here is that the paint strokes in um Substance Painter are kind of I don't know exactly how this works. it's kind of not obviously forwarded by the program. Paints are stored uh in world space somehow. And so even if you bring in a different model with completely different UVs, right, we changed some of the geometry a little bit. We fixed the UVs totally. Like these UVs are not at all like what they were, but the stuff that was painted with the brush tool still is where we want it. And that's the thing that would take the most time to fix. Right. The Yeah, this is missing, but that's just a matter of turning just turning that layer back on in this case, and we're good to go. And so now because we've properly UVed this, this looks like a thousand times better up here. Right? And this right now that I didn't even know that this was like this scribbly, you know, sort of hand painted kind of look before because it was so blurry, right? Because the pixel density was so low here. Now that looks great and you have to redo exactly zero work over here. Is that going to be the case all the time? Absolutely not. But um it is way more forgiving than one would think in terms of the way that this is set up here. So yeah, this is really super super useful. So now you can reexport this and you'll be uh ready to rock there. I mean I forget whether there was red over here a couple things, but now you know this because the face looked really good before and so it really made this look even worse. uh because those were so blurry. And so now we've achieved much better uh UV map and made this better 100% right out of the right out of the gate. Cool. All right. So, not a huge deal to fix that. Um cuz there's plenty of times when you import things into Substance Painter, you start working and then you're like, \"Ugh, I've got to go back and fix the UVs in order for this not to be terrible.\" And so that is the case there and that's possible. So everybody, that's what I would be writing down is that the paint strokes for the most part stay put if you need to reimpport the object. Now, the key thing was I didn't make a new file. I came up here and I said edit project configuration so that all that data was there. Obviously you make a new file the stuff is gone and you're just sort of starting over which you know if you have time is fine or if you need to redo it that's fine but cool. Um",

Uh, I decided to do the automatic unwrapping in Substance Painter, uh, since I thought it looked pretty easy. As you can see, I have my UV layout in my model front. Uh, when it comes to the colors, I still went with the black, red, and tan just like in my concept sketches. I had no plans on changing that. Uh, mostly everything went well except for the hat. It looks kind of old and damaged. Um, which brings me to my technical challenge that I had. Um, while in Blender, um, while I was still making my model, I noticed that it had like a lot of red dots around the h the hat. So, uh, I I already tried the the flipping the faces and the recalculate outside things, but it didn't work. I'm pretty sure that's what messed up the hat in Substance Painter. Um, so yeah, I don't know how to fix that. Uh, oh, I also realized that I forgot to show my um topology last time. So, I guess here it is. Um, I didn't change anything except for adding the colors, which >> Okay, so that's where you went drastically wrong, right? What What needs to change here? Amy, Amy, >> I'll give you a 50/50. Is it too high or too low? >> Yeah, it's way way way too low. Remember, like the the bones are not magic. They're just moving the existing faces, right? And so your arm is essentially two faces here, right, in length. Um, and then, um, yeah, the Can you send me the Blender file? You sent me the Substance Painter in the movie, but not the Blender file. Um, okay. So, and then like this is like super crazy dense here, right? Um, and so yeah, we you need to uh address, right? This is the main part of our body that's going to be probably bending a little bit, right? And then the legs will be moving. And so, you know, the quick version here is doing a remsh on the body to sort of distribute smaller squares. Like you have smaller quads. That's the default for the sphere on the head. But this it needs way more topology in order to deform when when it gets rigged. And you we need to make that change at this point so that well let's see in your case it's painted and we might be able to get away with it. Let's see. Ideally, you'd want to do that. But did I dial on this? Yes. If we look at this and bring it back over from Soipator, like because you're you're you just have way too few faces, but the way the faces are set up um looks okay. And so if we were to export, go to export textures, export USD. And so now in your case, we want to I I need to do that because I don't have the mesh. Um I'll go ahead and just make a folder here. There we go. This will be cat thing. There we go. and and I'll put template here. We're going to be going to Unity, right? Because I just need to worry about the topology right now, the actual geometry. So, let's export that stuff. Bring it in. Here's the USD file. There we go. Let's turn off robot. Here's cat thing. Um there we go. Uh so it got the name for this is obviously triangulation. uh things got triangulated. Usually when they're that's what I've been mentioning before happens when uh everything goes to the graphics card anyway. But I'm going to go ctr L and grab all of this and then rightclick and triangles to quads. Where was that? There. There we go. There we go. That gets us back. Let's do the same thing here. Control L. Thank you. Triangles to quads. Okay, that gets us back. Now, yeah, we need way more topology here. So let's grab this. Uh actually just because we went back to quads. Now our control t um controlr loop cut will work. And so I can add some loop cuts there. I can add some loop cuts here. And in this case, as long as we're kind of just giving ourselves a little bit more subdivision, it's not going to here in the back. It got a little squirly. For some reason, it didn't do this one. We can do it manually, perhaps. Grab this edge and then dissolve it. There we go. Now I controlR. And again up here, just some sort of manual management, right? So the main tools here are dissolve edges. That gets rid of an edge. That kind of gives us a hole there. We might be able to plug that hole. And delete that face. And then select this loop.

So things that look like they should connect, but they don't. I'm gonna go ahead and run a go to vertex mode and run a merge vertices by distance so that some of the things get collapsed. Maybe that helps a little bit here. And that now we could be able to select around perhaps if I go F. There we go. It does fill that in. The problem is now some of the painting may not quite work. Yeah, I mean it's going to take a lot longer here in terms of the mesh surgery part of it. Let's look at grabbing different parts. Cr and rettopize those parts. [Music] So here we want to retapologize this part but not this um the add-on which can I please get installed here. There we go. is just in object mode, right? Um, but I kind of want to do some parts and not other parts. So, you probably have a version of this where these are separate parts, right, in your Blender file where like the body is separate from the head. in which case you can just run the remsh on just the body. In this case, if we're having to change it afterwards, I can grab this and control L to get this and then separate selection makes it a new um object over here. Right? So now there's that and that. And so now it's a separate object. I can run this by itself on just the cloak. But I bet the scale is weird. No, it's not. That's fine. That's fine. Oh, okay. Our top level null has a really weird scale. So, there we go. That's why that was being so strange. Oh, now that got changed. Now it's fine. There we go. If we were to look at this now, we have something that's actually going to bend. Right. This is what we're looking for here. So, in your case, doing the mesh surgery. I thought we could sort of get by with it, but it's going to be a total hassle. So, you've got to go back to the original model, get evenly distributed quads, then bring it back over into Substance Painter. The Substance Painter part shouldn't take too long. The other part here with the hat is, is this hat just one piece? And I think it is. So here having some thickness is probably going to help because all the red dots we were talking about were here at the end of this, right? Yeah, I think that's what that was telling you. Just that it's the end of this piece. This is something where again if we you'll have this as a separate part but if you were to grab it um controll L right click um again you won't have to separate it out because it'll be a separate thing. This is now cat hat goodbye cat hat. There we go. Um, now the solidify modifier on the cat hat. This will be much easier for you because you'll have access to these individual parts where I'm just kind of having to get this to work. Crl L. There we go. This is Cat Hat. We can add thickness with the solidify. [Music] Let's see scale. I'm going to see this weekend if I can get if there's an add-on that makes everything I don't know some super ignous color if it's not have scale applied so that this can sort of be you're not you don't have to look you would see it all the time. Um there we go. Apply scale. There we go. Now if we look at this, [Music] can we finally apply this modifier? We can, but it does definitely perform strange. Okay, we had two faces here. This is not how I would recommend making the hat. I might do something like this. So, we'll get a cone here. We'll make it maybe slightly less, 24ish. And then we'll scale it down. Then uh we could do something to just get rid of this bottom face only. There we go. Now we have something that when you put the solidify monitor on, it should work. It gives us the inside, outside, and like some sort of thickness level there on this. If this were shade smooth or I go shade auto smooth here so that it respects this corner. shade smooth is trying to smooth out this sharp edge over there, right? And so we want smooth shading going around but not here. So you have two options. Shade auto smooth is supposed to be the automatic solution to this problem. End of story, right? Or if you put it on shade smooth, you I mean you can tell the shading here is messed up, right? Like this is not ideal. tab, select this edge, then you can individually mark this as sharp. And so then even with shade smooth, we get this part being smoothed, but then we get a sharp edge on the edge of the hat. You can see the inverse is happening here on the bottom. And so you can do the same thing here. You can come in and tab and grab this edge uh once you would apply the modifier there. So, do you think you understand what you what you want to have happen? You you tell me what was the problem before. I was supposed to focus on the hat. >> Okay. Well, that that's that's a strategic error on your part there, right? Like the you need to pay attention to the whole thing. But now that you're paying attention to the whole thing, what what do you need to pay attention to? What was wrong before? >> Too little. >> Too little. Right. And so I mean you can see the visual difference here between what we have now and what we had before, right? Um and so yeah, we want like equal equally distributed density. It's maybe not necessary on the hat unless you want the hat to like squish. Okay, the hat doesn't need to squish then it can look like this. But yeah, the big problem was that the body was just a handful of faces. And so I would go back into your Blender file, get this to a point where we have I mean you can see the difference, right? Right. Okay. And then then bring it back over to Substance Painter. I mean I I feel like your design is so solid. Did it take you a long time to paint it in Substance Painter? >> No. Right. So like going back and just redoing all the geometry, bringing it back over and then doing a repaint is your best workflow here. Right. You can see all the problems that like I run into just trying to go back and like do some fixes. Almost always the fix is like way more of a time crunch. Way more timeconuming than just going back and doing it again cleanly because the design is really really cool. Everyone really likes the design. It's just that we had really way way too light of the topology there. Does it make sense? Yeah. In terms of the painting, it looks really good. Um on the bell something the opacity channel here could help. So coming in here channels opacity and now wherever this is here's the bell. Yeah. So, this is painting in that black part there. I'm going to make a new paint layer. And instead of painting in black, I'll turn all this off. And in the opacity here, paint in black on the opacity. You're not going to see it unless you come over here to shader. Even though it's being painted, I mean, you could look at it here if you come in and look at opacity. And so you could just without even have to see it, you could just come in and paint it here because then later this will actually cut it out like a hole versus just making it black, right? Um, you can see it like this is one of those things where why are we not seeing it? It's because the shader that Substance Painter is running isn't calculating the opacity channel, but it is happening. Especially when you look at it here, it's being painted into that data. You can go over here to shader and pick this one that has seethroughness. And then if you were to look at the whole thing, it's actually cutting it out there. So there's a couple other people who would benefit from that as well. Okay. So just some going back and doing some retopology work is the main your main job there. Okay. Good progress.

Um, here is my kind of layout of all the textures that I did. And, um, I kind of broke them on down into different pieces, but now I realize that probably wasn't the best practice and that might make things, um, more complicated for me in the future. So, I might kind of go back and um fix and redo that if that's possible. Uh, if not, hopefully there's kind of a way to work around that. Um, I do think I have uh too much uh typology I think in my character in the arms and the legs. I wasn't really sure how to refine that without like taking away kind of the smooth and very like uh texture. I used the remify in the character and uh it still kind of looked kind of funky. I didn't really save in increments which is really bad. Uh, so I got to kind of a point of uh no return with the character. So she's she's really um, yeah, messy. I mean, not messy, like it looks okay, but it's a lot going on with the arms and the legs. U, but I brought her into Substance Painter to um unwrap the UVs, and that was really nice. I've tried re- unmapping um the UVs myself in Blender like only a couple times I think for a certain project and that was really challenging. Uh, so I really appreciated how simple um, Substance Painter made that. And it really like I don't know, it just really did like a really nice job uh, of breaking everything down. And I kind of did a more like realisticish texturing to uh the character to kind of contrast with uh the cute shape and stuff to kind of make the game a little off-putting but still kind of cutesy uh and really have that character kind of stand out. Um and yeah, she has a name now. Her name is Margaret. So yeah, that's her so far. I really had a lot of struggle with the clothing. I think it mostly is because I um had a lot of geometry right in like the legs and stuff and that I just it got it got a lot and I just I don't know I also was struggling to kind of uh just do some simple clothing down in Substance Painter since I was just working with a mouse. So, um, yeah, I I think she might look okay green, but I might go to Substance Painter later to give her some clothing. That's it so far. So, thank you very much for watching. >> Hi, it's Crimson, and this is my UV. >> Okay, that looks really good. Let's see here with Um, I think that's going to work. This it looks like you ended up running, right? So, this quad based when we see this kind of like ring thing here, this is the remesh. That's kind of what the remesh modifier does a lot of times to different parts of it. Um, if you just run that by itself. And so here's body that part. The pedals look good for sure. The There we go. All right. So, there's no modifiers on here. That's all right. But if we wanted to adjust this and this and this ctrl L and separate them out. There we go. Now we have legs and arms. And the you could lighten just those up again. Let's make it two and run that. And yeah, you see that now that's good. The fastening is just because of the shading. And so if we right click and shade smooth this, we have like still smooth looking arms and legs, but something that's going to deform much better when you put bones in it. And in fact, now because the topology is kind of laid out all right, uh you could even then come in and um let's see here. I mean, I'll do it this way. So, I'm just going to altclick on these. And I don't want to extrude. I want to extrude along normals. And so that could go either way in terms of like bring this in a little bit to make a cuff here. So that then this could become pants like so. And so now pants and then up here because this is already pretty good. Uh same sort of thing, right? So depending on what kind of pants we're talking about again extrude along normals gives us uh belt and then you know depending on how big of a belt buckle this character has. Let's see again. extrude along normals and then in this case right click or come back to object mode shade autos smooth should clean some of that shading up. So now, right, the belt buckle could also be something that happens in Substance Painter, but it would depend again on how big and prominent the belt buckle is, assuming that this character will definitely have a Texas-sized belt buckle of some kind. Um, but you know, now that makes that when you would go to UV unwrap the legs, I would put a seam there because then that would make it very easy to isolate those and turn them into legs or pants later on. Then you could do the same thing with the arms as well there, right? So just having that cuff in the model makes it much easier to then paint the appearance of the clothing on the character after that. But the character design looks great. The pedals look really really great for sure. Um, almost done.",

Uh, so I really appreciated how simple um, Substance Painter made that. And it really like I don't know, it just really did like a really nice job uh, of breaking everything down. And I kind of did a more like realisticish texturing to uh the character to kind of contrast with uh the cute shape and stuff to kind of make the game a little off-putting but still kind of cutesy uh and really have that character kind of stand out. Um and yeah, she has a name now. Her name is Margaret. So yeah, that's her so far. I really had a lot of struggle with the clothing. I think it mostly is because I um had a lot of geometry right in like the legs and stuff and that I just it got it got a lot and I just I don't know I also was struggling to kind of uh just do some simple clothing down in Substance Painter since I was just working with a mouse. So, um, yeah, I I think she might look okay green, but I might go to Substance Painter later to give her some clothing. That's it so far. So, thank you very much for watching. >> Hi, it's Crimson, and this is my UV. >> Okay, that looks really good. Let's see here with Um, I think that's going to work. This it looks like you ended up running, right? So, this quad based when we see this kind of like ring thing here, this is the remesh. That's kind of what the remesh modifier does a lot of times to different parts of it. Um, if you just run that by itself. And so here's body that part. The pedals look good for sure. The There we go. All right. So, there's no modifiers on here. That's all right. But if we wanted to adjust this and this and this ctrl L and separate them out. There we go. Now we have legs and arms. And the you could lighten just those up again. Let's make it two and run that. And yeah, you see that now that's good. The fastening is just because of the shading. And so if we right click and shade smooth this, we have like still smooth looking arms and legs, but something that's going to deform much better when you put bones in it. And in fact, now because the topology is kind of laid out all right, uh you could even then come in and um let's see here. I mean, I'll do it this way. So, I'm just going to altclick on these. And I don't want to extrude. I want to extrude along normals. And so that could go either way in terms of like bring this in a little bit to make a cuff here. So that then this could become pants like so. And so now pants and then up here because this is already pretty good. Uh same sort of thing, right? So depending on what kind of pants we're talking about again extrude along normals gives us uh belt and then you know depending on how big of a belt buckle this character has. Let's see again. extrude along normals and then in this case right click or come back to object mode shade autos smooth should clean some of that shading up. So now, right, the belt buckle could also be something that happens in Substance Painter, but it would depend again on how big and prominent the belt buckle is, assuming that this character will definitely have a Texas-sized belt buckle of some kind. Um, but you know, now that makes that when you would go to UV unwrap the legs, I would put a seam there because then that would make it very easy to isolate those and turn them into legs or pants later on. Then you could do the same thing with the arms as well there, right? So just having that cuff in the model makes it much easier to then paint the appearance of the clothing on the character after that. But the character design looks great. The pedals look really really great for sure. Um, almost done."

You would probably benefit from a review of that. Here's >> Hey, hello Alec here and this is the update version of my character model. So from last week I made some adjustment like for example his vest I decide to extrude it from his chest before it was like this was a separate piece but then I try loading the to try to know how it looks when animated and then because the best one separated from the model created some issues so in the end I decided to just extrude it. Maybe there's a way to keep it like this, but I'm not sure. >> So, you mean keep it? So, you just have to paint half of it or what? I'm not quite sure what your question was there where you're like >> best was from the model created some issues. So, in the end, I decided to just maybe there's a way to try to make the the bones. >> Uhhuh. >> And then that part where the vest wasn't working pretty well. So I decide to >> Oh, okay. >> I wasn't sure like we can make we can animate the the vest so it doesn't interfere with the >> I mean the vest will just get the vertices of the vest will just get mapped like the chest to the bones.

But like the Yeah, that should go along with everything else. Unless >> keep it like this, but I'm not sure. So, the other thing with the model is the head. I don't like how the spikes looks like right now. It's very subtle, but I still don't like it. And then I try using this combo, but I'm not very good at very good making changes here. And I always end up making a mess with the spikes. Originally, they look like this. Maybe more clean, but yeah. And between there and there you just that was a subd. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean apply >> I was supposed to >> No. >> Yeah. Not too dense. >> Okay. >> Good. Yeah. That's going to clean up that what you're seeing there. That's not going to be solved by the sculpting tool. The sculpting tool is only going to move the existing vertices and the shading errors are being caused by just probably not enough vertices there to represent the shape smoothly. And so this level of subdivision for the head fine this more clean but yeah the topology here is more dense. So I'm not I'm not I'm not sure if I just I should just keep it like this with a better topology or if I could if I could shape it to this other oil here. Next is to do I wouldn't >> I mean the other possible solution would be depending on when I can't see the topology but if there is a loop around this adding edge cuts just in this area as opposed to the whole thing with the subd but the subd solves the problem just fine so probably just go with that but if you just need to add extra loop cuts there that would also address it. >> If I wanted the dent to look like when I add the walls, this is how the map is looking like. I still learn how to place the UV maps the but overall it looks good. I don't see any like distortion anywhere. And then in some painter this how the model looks. I try to be like a bit like simple and carto for the other objects and that save me time like texture to everything and be very like detail with all the textures with the >> Did you speed up the video? >> Mhm. >> Did you Okay. Like I've I've listened to a couple interviews recently of people who now speak like this as if the video is going at double speed, but this is how they talk in real life now because they probably watched so many videos on Fast Forward that now this is how and I was like, you know, I was looking at the podcast player. I'm like, did I speed this up? You know, because especially when the person interviewing them is not in hyperspace like then it's a really weird like back and forth there. But you sped yourself up. the eyes. I tried painting them on Sultan Painter, but they don't look that good here. So, I probably just make them on Clip Studio and then import them back here. I think that's possible. >> The eyes, is that what you're talking about? >> Yeah. >> Okay. Well, the I mean, that looks good when you export it for now. Um Well, we don't need to export it. We just need to be rigging for the next week. But, um yeah, you have everything labeled and separate here. So you'll be able to access that. >> And then for the nose, I honestly don't know why just don't model it. The tutorial video on canvas show how to model a nose, this type of nose. But I just I was just convinced it should be done as a material. But then when I try scaling, it doesn't look that good. And I think I could increase the height here, but then it will affect other elements like the hat and then it it's it's not doing a great job. Yeah. So that's without displacement. That's all it's going to do, right? You can't pull it out with just the bump map, right? It's only with displacement that you actually displace the geometry. But for something like this, that's not how you would want to do that. You would want to do that if you if you want the nose a little bit more pronounced in the modeling. You would want to pull that out just and that should you've been very good with the topology. It should be easy to select the nose there and just extrude along normals a little bit there to pull that out. So yeah, that that's one of those things where it's like it's part of the silhouette of the character. So you want that to be in the modeling phase, not not you know like this this is only in Substance Painter, right? When it'll get baked down into a displacement map and then wherever you go at the end of the day, you would need to en enable displacement there to have it work. But you, especially for a video game, if if you're going back to Blender and it was just pictures of him like you did for 240, fine. That would work. Um, but for the game, no, because the displace you you don't want to have displacement happening on the main character of the game, right? It's just like a whole bunch of extra work the computer needs to be doing for something that's on the screen like all the time there. >> So, I don't know. I think I will just have to model the nose. >> But the character character looks awesome, right? especially in those um not all of you may have seen uh Alec use this for his he's in he's in all the classes but uh he used it for his 240 project as well and did some cool renders of the what's his name >> of Gio in the >> Cairo >> Cairo that's right Cairo Super cool. Awesome. Okay. So, yeah. Um, and since you're going to go back and make some modeling changes, the only other thing I might say is maybe just adding a little bit of a bevel to those two loops there. Um, it's I think having that sharp edge on the edge of the clothing is fine, but this seems like there's certainly like a PS1 PS2 error where that would be the case, but your character doesn't you you're not intentionally trying to make him look quoteunquote lowfi. He's just sort of a simple, you know, like a stylized but highfidelity looking character. So I if you're going to go back and make those changes here and here and like we just demonstrated, you're not going to need to start over from scratch painting. Just reimpport the new mesh and things should for the most part be copacetic there. Make sense? >> Yeah. But really cool. I think everyone loves the design of the character, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. The other thing here is perhaps like in painter here you could use the height channel to make like these are like >> pockets. >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So just a matter of doubling like very similar to what we did with um the sleeves, right? Just duplicate the layer, turn the height up, and then paint in, you know, like the top part of the pocket.

Uh, one for the clothes and one for the body because >> All right, I see where I see where this is going by the end of semester. >> I was having a lot of issues when it came to baking the meshes on. um it was messing up with the the skin in a way that didn't make sense. >> So the the body and then the mat those are two separate texture sets. >> The the body and then the clothes accessories. >> Uh so here is the body. Uh I took the feedback of I don't need to have all the faces that are are underneath. Uh >> did you also program a soundboard or are you editing this in later? do that. >> I'm glad to see that, you know, all of your post-production skills. This isn't what I en envisioned when I was teaching people about post-production that then this is where all those skills would get applied first, but you know, >> leg torso, the face, uh, which gave me a lot more room on here. Um, I did cut down the middle of the head. Uh, it was a little weird because I'm used to UV unwrapping the face very differently, but when there's no face, it did throw me off a little bit. Um, I wanted the seams to be on the bottom of the arms. And then I had them wrap around the fingers, uh, the legs on the inside and the torso and on the back. Switching over to the the clothes the the mask which is like the most important part which you see here takes up the vast majority of this space. I wanted to not have um any lines really. Um because this is where the LED uh screen is going to be. That's going to be what's animated. So just UV unwrap around there. uh spikes are on their own for the shoulder pad just the top and then here's the strap and then just along >> So is this character actually going to be inside the car? >> Yes. >> He's going in and out >> like like conceptually or like in the game we'll see the character in the car or they'll just sort of like appear outside the car. >> If I have time animate getting out of the car. Okay. So, the car is going to be proportioned to fit this character's head. >> The seams for the the shirt pants along the inside uh shoes I did chop up probably a little more than I needed to, but it felt right. Um, so that is my UV and wraps. Um, here is Razor. So, example of what the mask looks like. Uh there's little like LEDesque texture uh going on there, the little circles uh overlay um which is only within what is currently being displayed. And then this is um a mission and a little bit of base color. Um so giant ass zipper here, a bunch of stitching. uh studded belt of course. Um shoes, a lot of dirt because uh they're in the wasteland. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out. So, yay. >> All right. Now, if I'm going to teach you post-production, like let's get let's get our let's get our chroma key a little bit dialed in here. My little dirty >> also is that like is that video like 100 pixels by like 50 pixels? >> It was a gift. >> So I added the sound effects myself. >> Okay. >> Not razor looks great or I mean not great you know like however whatever uh well planned. Um, yeah. And so then you've got this as a separate one here. I mean, I heard you saying you think you're going to do the separate texture or separate geometry. >> I'm I'm still on the fence about it. I don't know how the eyes would work. >> They're not normal eyes. They could turn into an X. So it might just make more sense to just have an animated texture. [Music] >> So it's like one of these things, right? kind of >> not the one you use to uh rejuvenate your face. I mean, yeah, I don't know about that one. It's not not something I had on my 2025 bingo card, which is like we'll all willingly wear Dr. Doom masks to go to sleep now. Like, wow. The older you get, the weirder some things seem. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe this works, but it does seem like >> I mean, >> UV damages your skin. I don't see how LED is going to >> it. It's um >> it's supposed to be infr infrared, >> right? So, like the opposite end of the of the spectrum. >> I'm not that kind of doctor, so don't take don't take that. Okay. But but probably looks more looking more like this, right? >> Is what your >> a little a little bit higher resolution than >> higher resolution than that. But that that kind of >> Yeah. >> Did you put an emission channel? >> Yes, I did on the face. >> Yeah. And this is totally dominating LED mask results. That's a little bit >> high res. concept. >> How much is this stuff? >> It's like 400. Wait, >> dude. Did you pay $400 for one of these? >> That's a scale. >> Well, no. There are ones, though. >> Dr. Dennis Gross. That's his name. >> Dr. Dennis Gross. >> Who? >> Who are we talking about right now? >> I'm talking about Dr. Dennis Gross. But >> that's >> for 400. >> Oh, that he sells a $400 >> sells his own skinare LED mask. >> Oh, okay. So those those are $400. Yeah. >> Couldn't you buy this and just sort of like turn it around? >> Yeah. I thought I mean Yeah. And this one goes to your phone and everything. Hm. Okay. Yeah, having it separated out and easily accessible there. There's some options, but you know, let's go through a bunch of that on Monday once we get everything uh rigged and go through some texture options. But yeah, this is looking super cool. the Yeah, if we're going to see the character from behind, I mean, we've got the spikes, we've got this >> see them like every direction >> everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, it looks great. I mean, the only thing is like that's supposed to be hair, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Like >> I use the wood texture. >> The wood texture for hair. Yeah. What's it like really short? Look what your hair's doing. >> What are you saying about my hair? >> Sh like having a bit of like the shaved part for the back of his head might be Let's see. I'm not sure if we see >> like this tapered look back here like like on the back of the head. >> I don't know. I've never had a mohawk at any point. >> I'm glad you think that's Yeah. Yeah. So like >> yeah see something perfectly smooth like that but >> he shaves it daily. >> Mhm. I mean you could just put like a couple like Charlie Brown hairs here on the back. Um, yeah. It seems like certainly like some some bandages or I mean tattoos, right? >> That would be cool. >> Yeah. Yeah. Razor needs some ink. >> Yeah. Substance Painter is all about tattoos, right?

    "transcript_segment": "Hello. This is my assignment for the week. I had to go with two textures. Uh, one for the clothes and one for the body because >> All right, I see where I see where this is going by the end of semester. >> I was having a lot of issues when it came to baking the meshes on. um it was messing up with the the skin in a way that didn't make sense. >> So the the body and then the mat those are two separate texture sets. >> The the body and then the clothes accessories. >> Uh so here is the body. Uh I took the feedback of I don't need to have all the faces that are are underneath. Uh >> did you also program a soundboard or are you editing this in later? do that. >> I'm glad to see that, you know, all of your post-production skills. This isn't what I en envisioned when I was teaching people about post-production that then this is where all those skills would get applied first, but you know, >> leg torso, the face, uh, which gave me a lot more room on here. Um, I did cut down the middle of the head. Uh, it was a little weird because I'm used to UV unwrapping the face very differently, but when there's no face, it did throw me off a little bit. Um, I wanted the seams to be on the bottom of the arms. And then I had them wrap around the fingers, uh, the legs on the inside and the torso and on the back. Switching over to the the clothes the the mask which is like the most important part which you see here takes up the vast majority of this space. I wanted to not have um any lines really. Um because this is where the LED uh screen is going to be. That's going to be what's animated. So just UV unwrap around there. uh spikes are on their own for the shoulder pad just the top and then here's the strap and then just along >> So is this character actually going to be inside the car? >> Yes. >> He's going in and out >> like like conceptually or like in the game we'll see the character in the car or they'll just sort of like appear outside the car. >> If I have time animate getting out of the car. Okay. So, the car is going to be proportioned to fit this character's head. >> The seams for the the shirt pants along the inside uh shoes I did chop up probably a little more than I needed to, but it felt right. Um, so that is my UV and wraps. Um, here is Razor. So, example of what the mask looks like. Uh there's little like LEDesque texture uh going on there, the little circles uh overlay um which is only within what is currently being displayed. And then this is um a mission and a little bit of base color. Um so giant ass zipper here, a bunch of stitching. uh studded belt of course. Um shoes, a lot of dirt because uh they're in the wasteland. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out. So, yay. >> All right. Now, if I'm going to teach you post-production, like let's get let's get our let's get our chroma key a little bit dialed in here. My little dirty >> also is that like is that video like 100 pixels by like 50 pixels? >> It was a gift. >> So I added the sound effects myself. >> Okay. >> Not razor looks great or I mean not great you know like however whatever uh well planned. Um, yeah. And so then you've got this as a separate one here. I mean, I heard you saying you think you're going to do the separate texture or separate geometry. >> I'm I'm still on the fence about it. I don't know how the eyes would work. >> They're not normal eyes. They could turn into an X. So it might just make more sense to just have an animated texture. [Music] >> So it's like one of these things, right? kind of >> not the one you use to uh rejuvenate your face. I mean, yeah, I don't know about that one. It's not not something I had on my 2025 bingo card, which is like we'll all willingly wear Dr. Doom masks to go to sleep now. Like, wow. The older you get, the weirder some things seem. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe this works, but it does seem like >> I mean, >> UV damages your skin. I don't see how LED is going to >> it. It's um >> it's supposed to be infr infrared, >> right? So, like the opposite end of the of the spectrum. >> I'm not that kind of doctor, so don't take don't take that. Okay. But but probably looks more looking more like this, right? >> Is what your >> a little a little bit higher resolution than >> higher resolution than that. But that that kind of >> Yeah. >> Did you put an emission channel? >> Yes, I did on the face. >> Yeah. And this is totally dominating LED mask results. That's a little bit >> high res. concept. >> How much is this stuff? >> It's like 400. Wait, >> dude. Did you pay $400 for one of these? >> That's a scale. >> Well, no. There are ones, though. >> Dr. Dennis Gross. That's his name. >> Dr. Dennis Gross. >> Who? >> Who are we talking about right now? >> I'm talking about Dr. Dennis Gross. But >> that's >> for 400. >> Oh, that he sells a $400 >> sells his own skinare LED mask. >> Oh, okay. So those those are $400. Yeah. >> Couldn't you buy this and just sort of like turn it around? >> Yeah. I thought I mean Yeah. And this one goes to your phone and everything. Hm. Okay. Yeah, having it separated out and easily accessible there. There's some options, but you know, let's go through a bunch of that on Monday once we get everything uh rigged and go through some texture options. But yeah, this is looking super cool. the Yeah, if we're going to see the character from behind, I mean, we've got the spikes, we've got this >> see them like every direction >> everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, it looks great. I mean, the only thing is like that's supposed to be hair, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Like >> I use the wood texture. >> The wood texture for hair. Yeah. What's it like really short? Look what your hair's doing. >> What are you saying about my hair? >> Sh like having a bit of like the shaved part for the back of his head might be Let's see. I'm not sure if we see >> like this tapered look back here like like on the back of the head. >> I don't know. I've never had a mohawk at any point. >> I'm glad you think that's Yeah. Yeah. So like >> yeah see something perfectly smooth like that but >> he shaves it daily. >> Mhm. I mean you could just put like a couple like Charlie Brown hairs here on the back. Um, yeah. It seems like certainly like some some bandages or I mean tattoos, right? >> That would be cool. >> Yeah. Yeah. Razor needs some ink. >> Yeah. Substance Painter is all about tattoos, right? That's uh you could just have your own tattoo layers there. Cool. It looks great. Looks great. And then Yeah. Okay. I think I understand what we're going for on the mask at this point. Um, cool.

So right here we have the improved topology in Blender right there. >> So we have more um we got the remsh and the hat. And um I was doing the remsh on the cloak, but for some reason the polygons kept coming out a bit weird. So I just went with this more simple shape right here because I don't actually plan for Harley to move too much at the waist. Um >> okay, she's not going to be able to move at all at the waist here, right? I mean the in this case you're this is all one thing. And so the controlr loop cut would at least give you something there. So you should do that. Uh loop cut scroll wheel and give yourself some topology going around the corner. So I'm just um I'll probably come back in and try and improve it later on, but for now it's pretty. And then also the bottom there, deleting that face and then using that grid fill. Um the grid fill would fill that in. So that if the if the bottom is just one face, it's not going to um rig very well. >> Pretty simple mesh, right? >> Also, it looks like perhaps you use the mirror, but you didn't use the bisct. And so there there may be a whole bunch of overlapping geometry here. Let's see what happens when it gets into substitution. >> One of the issues I did come across um with remshing is that the symmetry got a little messed up somewhere. And now if I come in here, you can see there's like this seam. >> Yeah. >> Going down their head right here. And it's bothering me cuz it really shows up in Substance Painter. And I didn't really know how to fix it without um moving the axis too much and messing up all the sculpting I did. But um as for the sculpting, I did go ahead and add more shape to the hat. And then I fixed their snout right there. And I didn't really add anything else because um I still want to keep their model. Pretty pretty simple. So yeah. Um not sure what to do about that seam if there is a solution there. >> You have to select bisect on the mirror. >> Um I didn't notice it until I went into paint today. Um but that is the blender model. And then if we come into Substance Painter here, um here is the UV wrapping, I did do the automatic UV wrapping that Substance Painter has installed. Um and then as for like painting and things like that, um I was pretty true to my reference if I pull it up here. Um so like the colors were pretty much just color picked from there. Um and then the material that I used is the baked lighting just because I really like that um smooth clay look. So, that's what I went with there for the material. And again, this seam is really coming through here. And I It doesn't really show up in the renders that much, but when you go into the model, you can really see it. And I'm not sure how to fix it. Um, yeah. >> Okay. >> Isn't there like a smooth? >> Yeah. I mean, her her whole thing is doubled here. If we look at this here, and here and here and here and yeah. Okay. So the mirror modifier is not applied and so if we uh when you export it it gets applied and so it does this this I just want to click on something. What's the deal? Blender. I'm in object mode. I am clicking on said object. I have no idea what could have gotten turned on here. Let's see. Can I still What's that? >> Yeah. >> There we go. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, there we go. Now if I convert this to mesh and then looked at it you can see that we got everything doubled here, right? It's like a double wall that we don't want because that mirror got applied when you exported it. So, um, back to before applying the mirror modifier. What you're missing is this one, which means remove the stuff on the other side, right? And then things will come together. But before you do that, I would Okay. So you cut this is rettopologized. Something was just happening in the way that it was being viewed here. The only problem is like this part is you got the right idea. If this is on, it should cut it. And so now if we were to Is it trying to flip the other way? No, that's good. That's good. There we go. I'm not quite sure why we're not why it's changing the view there. Something to do with the overlay. But when we come in here, this all looks fine. This seam down the middle comes from the merging on the mirror modifier. If we come back here, there we go. So, the merge distance here, if we start to dial this up, it'll sew those together. And that gets rid of that. You want to go just far enough. Although, this might be an instance where maybe it's going to go too far. Let's see. Yeah. And so in order to get the face to look okay, it starts to destroy the hat. So this is a problem. But we can fix the face itself. But your main problem was that this was not on, right? So it was mirroring, but you had stuff on both sides. And so it was flipping it to both sides. And so you end up with this double wall of stuff there. And so we convert this to a mesh uh with that on. And so now these individual sets of seams here, you can just rightclick and say merge at center. And that sort of fixes that one that's right there. this one. [Music] We could get rid of that vertex or there might be a bunch of smaller ones there. But if we merge all of these, you'd have to do each one, but it's not that many. This allows you to take care of it and not try to come up with a value that works for the body but not for the hat. It just ends up being a little bit too much. I can't do them all at the same time because if I did two of them and I say merge at center, it smooshes them all like that, which is not what I want. I just want this one, this one, and here for sure. And you can see that this is taking care of the seam in the middle of the hat or middle of the face. You could start to clean up the hat in the same way. So yeah, this here that looked like it was a problem is actually fine. It was just the viewport that was giving you weird results and then your strange situation, the mirror modifier. So, you want to clean it up and then bring it back into um Substance Painter using that reimpport feature. And last but not least, here is we looked at Alex. We got here's Adrian's Here we go.",

So I know you this is not your game but and Squidward also looks very >> it's like a low poly. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it it works. It works. Um but >> here we go. um for my AMD analysis for um Around the Clock at Bikini Bottom, a fan game of um Spongebob. Right here is my updated um Night Zoo, my updated Night Scout character where in this game you'll be playing um in first person basically. Um you don't get to see much of the character a lot because well, you are playing first person. you only get to see like the hands or like the feet walking around. And then basically um this is my UV map also. Let's see. And there's not much to him exactly. There is like um you know this little um piece of metal to show a little bit of like the medieval times and also some block. I made it a little block. I wanted it a little like not smooth a little bit because in original night suits aren't that smooth exactly. They're kind of like pointy or blocky. >> Okay. And so did you try to achieve that by not applying shade smooth? >> I applied auto shape auto smooth >> which that's the intention I wanted >> smoothness but not too smooth like a ball like a animal organic creature. >> Right. Okay. And I got exact almost a lot of what I wanted on it. And that's my uh model. And here is my um my texture and MDA uh not my MDA um UV uh map where yeah, it looks kind of messy, but the point I wanted to give is where there's like a lot of cracks and um damaged armor because um this guy is not going to fight exactly. He he will sometimes fight in um fight the enemies that he's going to face, but I want him to look more damaged like his armor damage and broken and stuff like that. It does look a little messy. I'm sorry, but I just wanted to give like a feeling that it's really rust. Not rusty, but broken in pieces, but still holding on. And yeah. Uh okay, that's a good start here. But let's look at this real quick. So the here I get the feeling that you ran the Q remeshify on the whole thing at one time. And so that's that's a big ask and then it's going to end up doing some strange things like this. Right? This is essentially a cylinder. It shouldn't be crazy to rettopize. But when you ask it to look at the entire model at one point at one time, that's where it starts to run into problems. And so it's got to be something with the school computer here that's not keeping this installed. Okay, you'll have a version of this where uh they're separate parts, but if we were to grab something and control L and then just separate it off just to demonstrate my point here. Okay, so now this is a separate part. There we go. And I'll just do that. And so now if we run here's what we have now. And you can see there's some twisting. Things get kind of mushed up there. If we run this again, let's say two on it on just this part. There it goes. Much cleaner, right? Just that part. Let's look at the other part. So, if we come back to here, slashback out. Where else did things I'm not sure what some of this other is? It is this a thing there that >> it's like some how do you say pieces of like something I deleted there? >> Okay. >> You said like to delete the fingers and I decided to put like that's going to be hard to delete. >> Okay. Yeah, you definitely want to delete this stuff. I mean is it connected? Yeah. Crl L delet delete. >> I didn't know about L until now. >> Yeah. So, Ctrl L grab everything that's connected and then uh you know delete. There we go. That's cleaning that up because this actually looks okay. This is better now. And so yeah, this would be something. Now I would say say that if we do shade auto smooth on this now, it'll just create a seam here. and over here. Now the what you're trying to do with shade autos smooth I would say you should do yourself in the texture in the painting. And so let's go ahead and bring this. These I think are inverted if we were to look at them. No, they're okay. But if we were here the general idea would be such that here's some metal right and then I might try to paint the sort of raised parts of it. Right? So the make a new fill layer. This is going to be metal plate just on the height. Turn that up a little bit. Add a black mask. And then you could come in and start to bring this stuff up. If you get a sharper brush here, that might be a better way. You could start to paint your own plates on the armor. Maybe using the sharp brush and then using a blur filter would be the best route here because then you could control this stuff like so. But going back and cleaning up some of the pieces that are around there, control L is going to be your friend. Does that make sense? >> Okay, awesome. >> Um, and are the sleeves on the arms the gam or are they the armor? >> It's a different piece of armor since knights would wear different like pieces to to complete the armor set. >> So, bracers. >> Here's Zoe's.",

Okay, so now this is a separate part. There we go. And I'll just do that. And so now if we run here's what we have now. And you can see there's some twisting. Things get kind of mushed up there. If we run this again, let's say two on it on just this part. There it goes. Much cleaner, right? Just that part. Let's look at the other part. So, if we come back to here, slashback out. Where else did things I'm not sure what some of this other is? It is this a thing there that >> it's like some how do you say pieces of like something I deleted there? >> Okay. >> You said like to delete the fingers and I decided to put like that's going to be hard to delete. >> Okay. Yeah, you definitely want to delete this stuff. I mean is it connected? Yeah. Crl L delet delete. >> I didn't know about L until now. >> Yeah. So, Ctrl L grab everything that's connected and then uh you know delete. There we go. That's cleaning that up because this actually looks okay. This is better now. And so yeah, this would be something. Now I would say say that if we do shade auto smooth on this now, it'll just create a seam here. and over here. Now the what you're trying to do with shade autos smooth I would say you should do yourself in the texture in the painting. And so let's go ahead and bring this. These I think are inverted if we were to look at them. No, they're okay. But if we were here the general idea would be such that here's some metal right and then I might try to paint the sort of raised parts of it. Right? So the make a new fill layer. This is going to be metal plate just on the height. Turn that up a little bit. Add a black mask. And then you could come in and start to bring this stuff up. If you get a sharper brush here, that might be a better way. You could start to paint your own plates on the armor. Maybe using the sharp brush and then using a blur filter would be the best route here because then you could control this stuff like so. But going back and cleaning up some of the pieces that are around there, control L is going to be your friend. Does that make sense? >> Okay, awesome. >> Um, and are the sleeves on the arms the gam or are they the armor? >> It's a different piece of armor since knights would wear different like pieces to to complete the armor set. >> So, bracers. >> Here's Zoe's."

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Sailor Character PlayStation Style >> This is Jack with ABC 200 and um, it's late in the night. Um, so yeah, this is this is where my character's at. Um, I wanted to keep the blocky style kind of but still give him more topology. >> Jack, are you there? >> So yeah, a lot more topology than um, what we had before. What is this? But there's a random seam right there. Um, dang. But yeah, uh, I tried to, uh, change a lot of stuff around. Uh, make it look better. Uh, yeah, this crease here for the where the shirt meets the pants. Uh, crease for the where the pants meet the boots or the feet. Got a a thickened um cuff. I still divided the hat as well. And uh, yeah, I think it all is pretty nice and it's pretty evenly distributed. Place the seams myself. And um, these are the seams I did. I tried to put them in somewhat less seen places, you know, like on the underside of the belt. Um, you know, along the inside of the torso, on the inside of the legs. Yeah, it was kind of tricky. It was a little timeconuming, but uh I I think it looks good. And uh yeah, the UV I really like how this is. I mean, it's Yeah, I think it's nice. It's not too crowded. Um, there's a a few things are just like kind of thrown about like these are the tips of the finger. This is like this random face inside the body. So, this actually I guess I could get rid of this face, but I don't know. It doesn't matter. Yeah. And so, I tried to um kind of mark seams where I planned on like colors being different as well. Yeah. But yeah, I think this UV map looks good. Um, and I made the the head bigger actually. Yeah, I think it's bigger than the torso. I think that's good because the the face will be um yeah, probably the most detailed part. But yeah, so I'm doing like the PlayStation one style graphics and um I haven't quite gotten to the point that I want to yet. I'll show you in a second. So here's what I got so far. I'm not like I'm not super happy with it where it's at. Yeah, I I did a bunch of like research trying to figure out like how to get like that PlayStation one style uh graphics for like the texturing. Yeah, I'm definitely going to refine these later. Yeah, the the the plan will be to like eventually like export them, export the UV maps and then like downscale them so they become like pixelated. That'll get that'll match this uh like the blocky style a bit more. And also, as you can see, I don't have a face yet. So, um that's also an issue. But, um yeah. So, I mean, the overall color theme I'm going for, yeah, I was originally going for like that like this color. Like you said, I I I think I think white makes more sense. So, I'm going to stick to um white, but we got like the navy um neckerchief. Yeah. And then I also like these are the details I want to add to the the shirt still or yeah to the shirt still. So I want to add like these stripes to the collar and these stars and um on the collar as well. And I also want to add like an emblem on uh on one of the shoulders. Probably this shoulder I guess because that's where the camera's uh most likely going to be. I kind of maybe want to change the head shape as well. And I I think that's still very doable because I'm not I mean it only took me a little bit to get this down. So I'm I'd be fine to go back and uh change the head shape and stuff because I'm not sure if I like it. But um yeah, and it's gonna have like that like way too realistic like face on it like these kind of or Yeah, but it looks like really low uh low resolution. A question I do have is uh I was thinking of the character originally having their hat off and then um having them put it on like right after it starts. I don't know like I because this is built into to the UV mapping. So yeah, I don't know how I would go about doing that. keep it like this and maybe like swap between the models like have a model without a hat and then have a model with a hat and then like swap them. Now the I mean the top of the head is there, right? So yeah, I mean later on you can just separate the hat into a separate mesh >> which then you can strain to the headbone and that can be something that gets you know >> have a parent. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then just turn it on and off, you know, to have it appear or not appear >> once they put the hat on. But yeah, uh that that's where I'm at. I'm not super happy with where with where it is right now, but um yeah, I want to I want to continue working on it and make it uh actually look like a PlayStation graphics. I believe that's it. Uh, isn't there a pixel 8 effect? Yeah. have something set up so it's obvious what's happening. Okay, so there we go. And so now if I add the pixelate effect to this filter. Yeah. So then, you know, you could make this look lowfi, but then still keep, you know, more the actual pixel density for the face texture. Then um you're going to take a picture of your own face. >> Yeah, probably. >> Okay. >> Someone's face. I don't know. But I wasn't sure how to like actually like put the face on like >> Did you send me the substance painter? >> I did. Yeah. >> The face I didn't I didn't add the face to the project. >> But like I was looking at like projection stuff like I don't know. There we go. And so now uh I just do this. I'm going to bring this in as a texture cannot be or imported as a texture. Why not? It's a JPEG. Isn't it a JPEG? Yes, it is. Try that again. save as PNG. Should be able to import a JPEG, but for whatever reason, it doesn't like it right now. Um, this this could just have to do with the something about the shelf. I've done this before. Let's try it one more time. We just simply want the image in here. All right. It's not going to import any of those things right now. Right now, this will be an image that's in here. And so, if I just drag this up, it will project it onto color. There we go. And so now, I would probably want to do that actually from an aligned view. And so, if I just drag this on here like so. Say go to color. Gets its own thing. And so now uh my Wer keys allow me to move this around uh wherever I would want it to be in terms of positioning it there. And then you could also then add a black mask to this. And then um grab a soft brush and sort of paint it in where you would want and that would give you that, you know, transition from this to whatever the rest of it is there. But yeah, that would be your face. >> Your face looks a little different than this, but you get the idea. For what? This is just some sort of I've done this a bunch of times and I think I even did it on Monday, but for some reason, this is going to the other managed part right now, but we want to make the necessary changes, right? So to your topology, then to your substance painting, then going back and deciding which strategy for rigging makes sense, right? We did that on Monday. Does your character fit into the stubs category? Right? In terms of stub arm, stub leg, right? Or is the miximo rigging with the mixo a add-on the preferred route, right? So Amy, you're definitely in the stubs category there in terms of I think it's going to be way less hassle to do a simple skeleton for yours. Um, Daener's the little bunny character, very stubby legs for a lot of the other ones. I think going in. Landon, you're kind of on the border, but we looked at yours as an example there on Monday. Um, going in and using the Miximo auto rigging. Remember the getting the orientation correct before you send it up there, right? If you have to do any rotating, that's when our results were less than were just not usable, right? Because of the way the auto uh controls worked. But getting it rigged and being able what I'm going to have everybody do is just demonstrate the arm moving, demonstrate the other arm moving. You know, don't worry about setting any key frames. We'll do some animating and stuff next week, but just get the rig functional so that you can animate it. But don't if you do that now on something where you need to fix the geometry first, you're kind you're going to need to do it again, right? So get the geometry and the textures fixed like we went through. That's why I went through the time to make sure that everybody could get that fixed, right? So for most of you fixing there's some some geometry to be fixed, but that doesn't mean you need to repaint from scratch as we learned, right? with like crimsons, you can just bring update the mesh in the substance painter file and then make probably minimal changes and keep most of your painting there. Then bringing then going back to Blender and doing the rigging for the character.",

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Camera Techniques and Lighting >> Hello, Alex here and I'm going to present now my six renders for this week. Before that, I want to say that for the 2DC, my my original idea was that it should be ready for the close starting with the closeup to the wide shot. But you know, as you said, for the presentation, I'm going to be alternating between the 2D and the three scene. So, I going to start with the wide shot. So, this is the wide shot or WS, the medium full shot, MFS, also known as the cowboy shot, CS. This is the medium shot MS, medium closeup, MCU. Then this the closeup CU and finally the extreme close up ACU. Uh about the extreme closeup, I wanted to say that I tried what you chose in class to about using some noise note to create some bumps in the model. I tried that but didn't work well in these models. I'm not sure why someone >> didn't work well how >> like the you said it didn't work to create more detail. What what didn't like it didn't create more detail or >> just changing the colors of the model. >> Change the colors. Okay. >> Um yeah. So depending on the blend mode for adding in the noise, I think I didn't I on Godzilla I originally just did it on the bump channel, right? And then later I think I might have added something to the >> color channel, >> the roughness. >> I mean the principle is the same regardless. But you you had the you were doing it on the color channel. >> No, >> on the bump channel. Yeah. But the bump channel was changing the colors. >> It does happen to me too, actually. I think about it. >> Yeah, >> but uh I I don't know if this was for you. I think mine was like u the the material was already preset up and I didn't um change out like it was going instead of going into the bump node, it was going into normal map, I think. >> And so like it was showing color on it or something. I don't know. But I I changed it to a map later and that worked. So, >> okay. Is this in the 3D? >> Yeah. >> BL. Okay. I'll download that here. Let's Let's take a look. >> They're mainly used to show a character's expression animation. That's why for this example in the 2D scene, I focus more on my character face and expression. Then the main closeup focuses more on body language while also showing some of the expression. That's why here like I show the monster reaching out his his hand and then preparing to attack the woman and then white shots are usually used to showcase showcase the environment where the character is. For the dispencil scene I use two different techniques. the one making lines in the surface of the object for you know the lines in the walls and these lines in the floor and then also makes lines in the outlines of the objects. The only challenge I ran into was that I want to make the flame glowy but I wasn't sure how to make that. I tried different methods but no one really worked the way I wanted. So we just has a light a light in front of it. And then the other question I have is more related to camera shots just to be sure. If for example I have like this shot from the eye still is and still close up. Right. That's all for this week. Thanks for watching. >> Like if you have just one eye. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, I haven't heard anyone refer to this as like super extreme closeup or, you know, like I you know, I don't It would definitely be extreme. Yeah. At that point, if we just have one eye, um I mean, yeah, you I'm sure that would be made clear by whoever is directing what's happening there, right? I mean, in real life, you would have to put a camera like right in someone's face, so everyone would know what was happening there. Um, cool. And then on these, so did you draw this light or were those What's that? >> The light. >> That's from the light object. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, that's super cool. I think everyone agrees this was super well done. >> The shadow of the character, >> I think it's a circle. mesh >> circle mesh that you put there. Okay, >> let let me just pull up the file to see if there's anything obvious. [Music] It's this scene right that has the wolf in it. I think just on the There we go. All right. So, back to here. And so when you would run this into here, is that what you >> is that similar to what you were getting? >> No. >> That's what I was talking about. Like >> if you try to bring it to the normal map thing. >> Okay. So there's the original one. Here's the one with the noise detail. So, this this is not what you were getting. >> I don't know. I was pressing the buttons better. >> I'm just kidding. This has happened to me constantly. Um I mean, how different were the colors? Like just like >> purple >> more purple. >> No, I mean you I mean this looks right. Were you using that computer or your other computer? Yeah. Is it doing it right now? >> Yeah. Give it a shot. Because this now we're getting the, you know, enhanced bump detail on the surface of this terrible monster. Although the No, that is something. I think it's just the shadowing from is there light here? Yeah, this is just adding this surface level detail there. Yeah, having this cranked down to zero gives you this like super sharp shadow and just softening that up and still gives you the shading, but then you know like that's much more naturalistic. Yeah, that looks super cool now up close like that. Uh yeah. No, you got it right. I don't but pull it up on there and then we'll we'll see. And then the other one. So you wanted to add glow to the flame. >> Just to the flame. Okay. Yeah, we'll look at something about that when we're done here. But those are all super cool. I think everyone said as much on Discord, rightfully so. Yeah, really nice. I mean, these kind of serve as like um concept art for your game.

Uh so, first off, this is a white shot I made. >> I was like, is this my chemical romance? a concert. Um, I did a lot of extra stuff like you know at concerts they have the hanging speakers. I did that. It's not visible in here. >> Um, but >> yeah. Um, the it's just middle of a concert, you know, everyone's rocking out the the narrative purpose of it. Um, next shot. Um, more of that singers doing a weird little pose. That guitarist is doing things. Um, and then this is like during a sad moment of a song. I really like the black. Yeah, I was gonna say, did you put more eye makeup on on Remy? >> I don't remember Remy being this emotional. >> Eyeliner looks like black eyeliner. Uh, makes him look very emo. Um, and then for grease pencil, I uh did this. Um, I'll pull up my scene real quick. >> I mean, this kind of looks like concept art for your game. this uh I will open um 2D. Um so I had a lot of problems with it. Um I had this is after I redrew. Um I wonder if you can see the 3D one. Yeah. So this one um will show the problem I had which I tried to troubleshoot assuming. Yeah. So it does weird alphaing whenever there's like overlap. Um but also there's had so much problem. You see it a lot with the the stairs. I think even in the final render. Yeah, even in the final render you see >> then. Did you have the Zbox checked? >> I had the Z box I had in front. >> Um, I talked about it. Uh, how I eventually figured out how to do that or like fix it is to redraw it. Uh, however, when I redrew it, um, let's go to 60. I guess not 60. Um, when I read through it, uh, it was I got one of these. The 2D should be um the the line art that I had to replace. It was an issue with the default um material brush material, the black that I had to fix. Uh, so I made a new black. Um, but I had already rotated this towards camera. So then when I redrew it from the camera perspective, it was a little off, which then meant uh for the following renders, they were a little offset. And then I started getting these little artifacts. I tried to like push everything around and like try to move and it I just had so much trouble with it and I spent too much time just trying to fix that white overlap alphaing issue which the solution was to just redraw it all the all the line art. >> I didn't even know it's it's happening here too. I don't I had so many plans. Uh I had this nice little spiral staircase. All of these columns I had so many so many plans. >> You made a really large staircase there. >> Thank you. That took me like two hours to figure out how to do properly. >> The large staircase >> maybe three hours. Um yeah, the new on five now you can do an array on a curve which is what one would hope there. Let me just open it up to see if we get the same sort of thing. I think is except the stairs. The stairs still use the old black material. >> So there should be the same error >> on the stairs. >> Also kept on crashing cycles. So all of this here >> and that when I still had the line art for the character anytime that there was overlap it would have >> it would have that to redraw his notes. What? >> What version of Blender are you using? >> I don't know. I found like Blender 4.3 does not crash as much. I don't know. Try that as well. >> Definitely considering that [Music] See, it doesn't make sense. From what I could tell, I was the only person that had this issue. So, you don't need to take up. >> Yeah. I'm just curious. Yeah, it's definitely some sort of like overlap thing, but no one else is running into this. Oh. Uh, yeah. I mean, see if you can, you know, make a new scene where you just not not the whole thing, just whether something happened with this file, like some sort of setting and then Yeah, cuz if it's just running into this here, I mean, I thought for I thought it might be something with the light, but there's something going on there. Or see if you can Yeah. reproduce in another scene from scratch. That would probably be the first step in solving the mystery. Cool. Yeah, the the band shots look really cool. The maybe a little underexposed, but the a couple things we can bring in here. Yeah, I mean just in terms of like uh a movie file running into the emission output on this background, you know, will give you that you know LED wall kind of thing which would then give you a lot more activations >> the image into the >> but it was a very dark image >> probably should I didn't want like the attention to be on the screen I wanted to be on the performers >> which is why I went with the darker more atmospheric backdrop for it >> yeah did you use a volume here >> to have the be visible. >> Yeah. Yeah. More of those like beams of spotlight. >> There's like 10 spotlights on the top angled differently. >> Uhhuh. >> Uh then there's um three area lights. Two like on the front sides of the stage and one in the back. >> Okay. >> Red, purple, blue. >> Okay. Well, in in that case then just none of that is like showing up in the image. You know what I mean? like like if you're going to have that many that sounds like a lot of lights. Um so you know if you're going to be using that many adjust you know you want to you want to see that you know in the image there in terms of like the volutric lines intersecting each other that's all going to help it really read you know concert way more um than currently. But yeah, in real life production, you know, like when you're getting money from the producer, they're like, \"We want to see this money on camera, right?\" And so like you're you're not spending money here, but you're spending a lot of CPU cycles on stuff that's like not showing up on in the final render there. But but good job staging everything and constructing the scenes. Yeah, that's a weird one. I haven't seen that myself and so I'll see if I see if you can reproduce it in like a separate scene. That would be my first guess. And Nat,",
    "transcript_segment": ">> Hello. This is my assignment for the week. Uh so, first off, this is a white shot I made. >> I was like, is this my chemical romance? a concert. Um, I did a lot of extra stuff like you know at concerts they have the hanging speakers. I did that. It's not visible in here. >> Um, but >> yeah. Um, the it's just middle of a concert, you know, everyone's rocking out the the narrative purpose of it. Um, next shot. Um, more of that singers doing a weird little pose. That guitarist is doing things. Um, and then this is like during a sad moment of a song. I really like the black. Yeah, I was gonna say, did you put more eye makeup on on Remy? >> I don't remember Remy being this emotional. >> Eyeliner looks like black eyeliner. Uh, makes him look very emo. Um, and then for grease pencil, I uh did this. Um, I'll pull up my scene real quick. >> I mean, this kind of looks like concept art for your game. this uh I will open um 2D. Um so I had a lot of problems with it. Um I had this is after I redrew. Um I wonder if you can see the 3D one. Yeah. So this one um will show the problem I had which I tried to troubleshoot assuming. Yeah. So it does weird alphaing whenever there's like overlap. Um but also there's had so much problem. You see it a lot with the the stairs. I think even in the final render. Yeah, even in the final render you see >> then. Did you have the Zbox checked? >> I had the Z box I had in front. >> Um, I talked about it. Uh, how I eventually figured out how to do that or like fix it is to redraw it. Uh, however, when I redrew it, um, let's go to 60. I guess not 60. Um, when I read through it, uh, it was I got one of these. The 2D should be um the the line art that I had to replace. It was an issue with the default um material brush material, the black that I had to fix. Uh, so I made a new black. Um, but I had already rotated this towards camera. So then when I redrew it from the camera perspective, it was a little off, which then meant uh for the following renders, they were a little offset. And then I started getting these little artifacts. I tried to like push everything around and like try to move and it I just had so much trouble with it and I spent too much time just trying to fix that white overlap alphaing issue which the solution was to just redraw it all the all the line art. >> I didn't even know it's it's happening here too. I don't I had so many plans. Uh I had this nice little spiral staircase. All of these columns I had so many so many plans. >> You made a really large staircase there. >> Thank you. That took me like two hours to figure out how to do properly. >> The large staircase >> maybe three hours. Um yeah, the new on five now you can do an array on a curve which is what one would hope there. Let me just open it up to see if we get the same sort of thing. I think is except the stairs. The stairs still use the old black material. >> So there should be the same error >> on the stairs. >> Also kept on crashing cycles. So all of this here >> and that when I still had the line art for the character anytime that there was overlap it would have >> it would have that to redraw his notes. What? >> What version of Blender are you using? >> I don't know. I found like Blender 4.3 does not crash as much. I don't know. Try that as well. >> Definitely considering that [Music] See, it doesn't make sense. From what I could tell, I was the only person that had this issue. So, you don't need to take up. >> Yeah. I'm just curious. Yeah, it's definitely some sort of like overlap thing, but no one else is running into this. Oh. Uh, yeah. I mean, see if you can, you know, make a new scene where you just not not the whole thing, just whether something happened with this file, like some sort of setting and then Yeah, cuz if it's just running into this here, I mean, I thought for I thought it might be something with the light, but there's something going on there. Or see if you can Yeah. reproduce in another scene from scratch. That would probably be the first step in solving the mystery. Cool. Yeah, the the band shots look really cool. The maybe a little underexposed, but the a couple things we can bring in here. Yeah, I mean just in terms of like uh a movie file running into the emission output on this background, you know, will give you that you know LED wall kind of thing which would then give you a lot more activations >> the image into the >> but it was a very dark image >> probably should I didn't want like the attention to be on the screen I wanted to be on the performers >> which is why I went with the darker more atmospheric backdrop for it >> yeah did you use a volume here >> to have the be visible. >> Yeah. Yeah. More of those like beams of spotlight. >> There's like 10 spotlights on the top angled differently. >> Uhhuh. >> Uh then there's um three area lights. Two like on the front sides of the stage and one in the back. >> Okay. >> Red, purple, blue. >> Okay. Well, in in that case then just none of that is like showing up in the image. You know what I mean? like like if you're going to have that many that sounds like a lot of lights. Um so you know if you're going to be using that many adjust you know you want to you want to see that you know in the image there in terms of like the volutric lines intersecting each other that's all going to help it really read you know concert way more um than currently. But yeah, in real life production, you know, like when you're getting money from the producer, they're like, \"We want to see this money on camera, right?\" And so like you're you're not spending money here, but you're spending a lot of CPU cycles on stuff that's like not showing up on in the final render there. But but good job staging everything and constructing the scenes. Yeah, that's a weird one. I haven't seen that myself and so I'll see if I see if you can reproduce it in like a separate scene. That would be my first guess. And Nat,"

You have to like be careful with that and everything. You can change different characters. I didn't know that until I I think halfway throughout the game cuz I just forgot in general. um since I like playing with that one character a lot. Um a lot of things I learned while working with different shot sizes in two different styles was um very informative but can be very difficult for my head to kind of like get through it which one was that I remember but really like how this one came out which is very fun. Um, I think I can definitely work better with the ratios. I think I could have moved her further down and then this should have been like around hereish, I think. Um, yeah, I had some trouble with the noise modifier. I don't know if you can see it. This is very l like uniform compared to how I wanted it to be. I added it on there, but it didn't really move a lot even here. I don't know why this is double. was very strange. But maybe it's because I haven't turned in other modifiers on there. I'm have to double check. I think that's probably why actually Oh, okay. So, all the grease pencil stuff is still geometry, right? It's all curves that have been set up in this other rendering environment. So the two things that maybe like either the scale on the noise is like really big and so you know like a a big dark spot of the noise may be taking up the entire size of the line so it's not like jiggling this. And the other thing is like the amount of subdivisions on the line. And so there's there's also a subdivision surface or not subdivision surface just a subdivide modifier. And so putting the subdivide modifier subdivide grease pencil modifier on top of the sub of the noise grease pencil modifier may give you more of the wobbly line thing. What did you say the name goes? Cyber punk. Cyber >> cyber funk. >> Cyber funk. >> Botan. >> Okay. Cyber funk. Yeah. No, the game I was thinking of was Hi-Fi Rush. Anybody play High Rush? Has a similar sort of look. I want to >> uh yeah, I mean I'm like I made a few through I don't know a couple bosses, you know, haven't had time to come back, but it looks just super really really nice. Um >> and then they >> Yeah. Yeah. This is Yeah. There's no way to sugarcoat it. This is a real depressing situation here, especially for people wanting to work in video games, is like this. This game, what was it last year or the year before? Won like a bunch of awards. The studio was acquired by Microsoft, right? I think. and then and then promptly um shut down and everyone got laid off even though they had just made an award-winning game that one as far as I understood like made money like it's just more another anecdote that I don't really understand how business works like I don't know why you would buy a company just to shut it I mean it's not your competitor it's not like this company was upstaging Microsoft, but they acquired them and then promptly shut it down. I'm sure it just comes down to just one VP not knowing what the other VP was doing or one of those kind of things. But yeah, the game is fantastic. Um, you know, like uh you're doing combat stuff but in rhythm to the music, which is really cool. >> All right, here's Crimson. >> Hi, it's Crimson and these are my shot sizes. Okay, the first one here is the the wide shot. And I really um used well, you use the wide shot to kind of just introduce somebody to the scene. And so, I don't know, I just wanted to do something simple but pretty. So, I have this woman in like some deserty landscape uh stargazing cuz I think stars are pretty. And I put this bottle here just to add some more visual interest. and then also like the line to her face. So, it's kind of >> got a better composition there. And then for the medium full shot, um I changed the pose where she's like kind of kicking back and relaxing more into the chair. And then she's still just off looking in the distance, making it more like you're getting into it, getting to know her, blah blah blah. And then we have this one where she's fully settled into the chair again. And this one I feel like with the shadows over the eyes just make it seem like kind of lonely, especially cuz it's like a big old desert. And then finally for the um closeup or like the medium close-up one, um I wanted to go on her face because her face is very like melodramatic like neutral looking and it's like in the shadows with the the mountains. >> That's a generous way to describe the Miximo models. very very new. >> I switched it up to where it's like she was facing a different side and that way it just kind of made it seem more sad I guess or I don't know like this I was very lost for what I was planning to do so I kind of just went with it. And then for my grease pencil one um this is my closeup. So, I have this dragon and he's currently destroying the city. So, um I don't know why I I drew the dragon first in Procreate and then put it in, but I forgot that when you put it on planes, it gets affected by the lighting. So, you can see like all my lines are weird looking and it didn't look as graphic as I wanted to. So, I went over some of him with the grease pencil to try to bring them out more. And then the extreme closeup with mainly just his eye and all of that and the side of his head and then changed the angle of the city for that. And for the grease pencil scene, I just hand drew all of the elements around it instead of using like pre-generated ones cuz I felt like it was more cartoony that way and it was fun to like have wiggly lines be all messy and stuff. Um, some challenges that I faced was here. Let me open it again real quick. If I open it here, if I open my grease pencil one and I render it, um, one of the main problems I faced was, oh, was that Yeah, you can see all the lines and like it looks fine from the angle I was at, which is great. That's what I needed. But even when I was in the surface mode or when I had it set to surface where it would draw only on the surface, it's still like it worked for the beginning cuz you can see that's only on the surface. This is only on the surface. This is only on the surface. That but then it just stopped working. So I don't know what caused that, but that was definitely an issue. Yeah, those are my uh shot sizes. I mean, it depends what draw mode you were in here. If you were projecting onto the surface, that's what happens there. It's like as soon as you go just a tiny bit off the projected surface, it projects continues to project back into the scene. Um, so yeah, that I mean we we were looking at that when we looked at it originally, especially if you use the stroke version, the stroke mode or the projection mode, you know, like here, I think I think you want about this in the right way. Just maybe think about it a little bit differently. And so when you made these uh cubes to draw on the correct strategy here to might make this a little bit bigger so that when you scri do your scribbly line on it, you know, your stylized handdrawn line, it stays completely within the piece of uh geometry that you're projecting on. and then later just turn off that piece of geometry so that you have this there. And that that would be a more solid technique there. In terms of the drawing the dragon, the dragon looks great. These scenes like have a real cool consistent like paper cutout stylized look. I think everyone is very hip. Um everyone. >> No, no, the the dragon is very hip. You guys think it's very hip, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. Um, let me see. Is it this one with the shader? Um, if we looked here and cross our fingers. We didn't. Yeah. >> Yeah. It's not packed. What happened to her? Okay, there she is. here. Let's see. Does this do what we're talking about? [Music] Yeah. Okay. This is what we want. Yeah. So here this is functioning like you know two two big shaders are going to be the code that runs on the GPU that actually takes the takes the images and then processes them to render them in the scene. Two big categories lit means that you know it's going to get uh lights and shadows and whatnot and then unlit. And so what what you were looking for there, Crimson, is an unlit shader. In Blender, it's not called unlit, but the emission shader is doing this job for us here. And so this different, you know, like every time you make a new material, by default, it's the principal BSDF, which is the acronym I can't remember. Um, and this is a much simpler thing that's just taking the color and running it directly onto the surface of whatever the geometry is. And so if that's back at one, there it is. And then no matter what's happening with the light here, right? So I turn this light up to whatever that is. And you know, like it's completely blowing out on this um chair or whatever this is here. And even with the right there we go. But this remains unaffected because it's not in the system there. It's not in the same system. And so that's what you would want for your dragon that you brought in on a plane from Procreate. you'd want to change the shader to the emission shader and then then you could light the other things and you know take care of everything else. So, especially when you're working in that mix 2D 3D environment, that's going to be really um useful probably. Okay, awesome.",

Okay, the first one here is the the wide shot. And I really um used well, you use the wide shot to kind of just introduce somebody to the scene. And so, I don't know, I just wanted to do something simple but pretty. So, I have this woman in like some deserty landscape uh stargazing cuz I think stars are pretty. And I put this bottle here just to add some more visual interest. and then also like the line to her face. So, it's kind of >> got a better composition there. And then for the medium full shot, um I changed the pose where she's like kind of kicking back and relaxing more into the chair. And then she's still just off looking in the distance, making it more like you're getting into it, getting to know her, blah blah blah. And then we have this one where she's fully settled into the chair again. And this one I feel like with the shadows over the eyes just make it seem like kind of lonely, especially cuz it's like a big old desert. And then finally for the um closeup or like the medium close-up one, um I wanted to go on her face because her face is very like melodramatic like neutral looking and it's like in the shadows with the the mountains. >> That's a generous way to describe the Miximo models. very very new. >> I switched it up to where it's like she was facing a different side and that way it just kind of made it seem more sad I guess or I don't know like this I was very lost for what I was planning to do so I kind of just went with it. And then for my grease pencil one um this is my closeup. So, I have this dragon and he's currently destroying the city. So, um I don't know why I I drew the dragon first in Procreate and then put it in, but I forgot that when you put it on planes, it gets affected by the lighting. So, you can see like all my lines are weird looking and it didn't look as graphic as I wanted to. So, I went over some of him with the grease pencil to try to bring them out more. And then the extreme closeup with mainly just his eye and all of that and the side of his head and then changed the angle of the city for that. And for the grease pencil scene, I just hand drew all of the elements around it instead of using like pre-generated ones cuz I felt like it was more cartoony that way and it was fun to like have wiggly lines be all messy and stuff. Um, some challenges that I faced was here. Let me open it again real quick. If I open it here, if I open my grease pencil one and I render it, um, one of the main problems I faced was, oh, was that Yeah, you can see all the lines and like it looks fine from the angle I was at, which is great. That's what I needed. But even when I was in the surface mode or when I had it set to surface where it would draw only on the surface, it's still like it worked for the beginning cuz you can see that's only on the surface. This is only on the surface. This is only on the surface. That but then it just stopped working. So I don't know what caused that, but that was definitely an issue. Yeah, those are my uh shot sizes. I mean, it depends what draw mode you were in here. If you were projecting onto the surface, that's what happens there. It's like as soon as you go just a tiny bit off the projected surface, it projects continues to project back into the scene. Um, so yeah, that I mean we we were looking at that when we looked at it originally, especially if you use the stroke version, the stroke mode or the projection mode, you know, like here, I think I think you want about this in the right way. Just maybe think about it a little bit differently. And so when you made these uh cubes to draw on the correct strategy here to might make this a little bit bigger so that when you scri do your scribbly line on it, you know, your stylized handdrawn line, it stays completely within the piece of uh geometry that you're projecting on. and then later just turn off that piece of geometry so that you have this there. And that that would be a more solid technique there. In terms of the drawing the dragon, the dragon looks great. These scenes like have a real cool consistent like paper cutout stylized look. I think everyone is very hip. Um everyone. >> No, no, the the dragon is very hip. You guys think it's very hip, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. Um, let me see. Is it this one with the shader? Um, if we looked here and cross our fingers. We didn't. Yeah. >> Yeah. It's not packed. What happened to her? Okay, there she is. here. Let's see. Does this do what we're talking about? [Music] Yeah. Okay. This is what we want. Yeah. So here this is functioning like you know two two big shaders are going to be the code that runs on the GPU that actually takes the takes the images and then processes them to render them in the scene. Two big categories lit means that you know it's going to get uh lights and shadows and whatnot and then unlit. And so what what you were looking for there, Crimson, is an unlit shader. In Blender, it's not called unlit, but the emission shader is doing this job for us here. And so this different, you know, like every time you make a new material, by default, it's the principal BSDF, which is the acronym I can't remember. Um, and this is a much simpler thing that's just taking the color and running it directly onto the surface of whatever the geometry is. And so if that's back at one, there it is. And then no matter what's happening with the light here, right? So I turn this light up to whatever that is. And you know, like it's completely blowing out on this um chair or whatever this is here. And even with the right there we go. But this remains unaffected because it's not in the system there. It's not in the same system. And so that's what you would want for your dragon that you brought in on a plane from Procreate. you'd want to change the shader to the emission shader and then then you could light the other things and you know take care of everything else. So, especially when you're working in that mix 2D 3D environment, that's going to be really um useful probably. Okay, awesome."

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Alien Encounter Scenes Here's Gavin. >> Hi everybody. This is Gavin. Um I already recorded this once and I talked way too much. I'm gonna really just I'm just going to speed through this really quick here. Um, and no, you don't get the bell. Not yet. Uh, so we got the first shot, wide shot or a WS shot. This is my first scene. I took the scene I made with LeBron dancing on the truck. Um, reused that and I wanted to go for like a alien theme. So, I found this UFO on Sketch Fab and this alien model on Sketch Fab. I mean, if you would have kept LeBron in there, I think it would have been a more interesting. Added some bushes around. Uh, and this is the wide shot. Um, as you can see, the character is, you can see their full body, but it's also their with the environment around them. Um, uh, yeah. >> Yeah. Really great use of the volutric uh, light here, right? I mean, I guess the story I'm trying to tell with this is and uh with the other images is like this one is kind of introducing you to the setting and kind of making it seem like you're an onlooker coming in and seeing what's happening, which is going to make sense later as you see more of these images in this series. We got the cowboy or the CS shot. Really quickly, I'm just going to show you. This is the grease pencil scene I made. I drew Mr. Peppermint. This is for my ABC 200 game. Um, I decided to make like a a little kind of thing just >> Yeah, it's kind of turned into the ABC 200 uh concept art. >> Showing off what the world might look like. Drew him with grease pencil. Uh, figured out how to use the fill tool. Uh with the other grease pencil stuff, I drew on the surface a lot like these windows on the buildings um on the ground here for the little curbs curb areas. And then also it's not showing it clearly here, but um uh for like the corners of the buildings and then for these lamposts, I used the object line art to automatically make some of these things. And then I had to change the thickness. And for the world scene, I used one of the HDRs and added a saturation node and turned it down so that it matched the black and white stuff. Anyway, this is the cowboy or CS shot. Um, yeah, that's kind of it. It's above the knees. Uh, but it's keeping everything very interesting shot. Uh, yeah, this is really good. The only thing here is like since we have this kind of control over it, you know, staging it so these lights don't tangentially come out of Mr. Peppermint's head, you know, just does a little bit awkward framing. >> I gave him a gun to kind of match that cowboy aesthetic. Uh, we got the medium or the MS shot. Uh, this is roughly waist up as you can see where his disgusting belly is right here. Um, yeah, >> roughly up from the waist of the pregnant sixeyed alien. >> And then this is it's kind of like you you're getting closer to the alien. That's kind of what I want you to feel like um is happening. And I think the angle here is good. Pretty It's kind of matches the rule of thirds pretty well. So, I like that. We got the closeup or the MCU shot. And I angled this kind of looking up. And this is chest up. Um I believe that's what uh how to describe this. Uh, and I wanted to make it close up, uh, facing up because it kind of feels like like the weight of the world is coming down on Mr. Peppermint here, which cuz the the main idea of the the shot is that he's seeing something that's shocking to him or he's like at disbelief for words. And I I wanted to have that so the sky is like in the And I think I think it turned out pretty well here. Let's move on. Yeah. And he's shocked. It's kind of And then we just have a closeup or a CU shot. Uh, and this one is kind of I added like that angle to add to that kind of worried feeling to the shot. Um, to add also to the story like we're getting closer. We're seeing the emotions on his face change. And lastly, we got the extreme close-up shot or the ECU shot. And uh I use this as an opportunity. I thought of ways to I can make it interesting or tell a story using this. So I use the reflection of the alien's eyes to see who you are the viewer. We are Mark Wahlberg collectively all of us. And we are the ones because Mark Wah basically the story is he he's getting closer to this alien and finally we are eye to eye with the alien. Um so I really like that. What's that? Did Mark get the alien pregnant? >> Moving on. Anyway, so I already talked about that. Um, you I realized very quickly working in grease pencil is kind of awkward a lot of the time. Uh, I had to figure I had to use different ways. I had to like activate Z something. I forget what it was. Uh, yeah. And data here. I didn't I didn't have that check. So, I had to I had to It took a lot of finicking around, but I figured it out. Um and yeah, uh I guess that's it. Yeah, these look great. The like um yeah, just when you're doing this kind of like mixed rendering in terms of like the flat drawn things with the 3D environment, like you did a really nice job building the 3D environment. The only thing that sort of like stuck out to me here is like, you know, these lines are pretty not wobbly while these lines are pretty wobbly. And so like just making the background some sort of consistent line weight would be the next step there. And then for shots like this, uh the one Yeah, like here, the one where we're looking up at him. Yeah. So yeah, you would just need to make a stylistic decision about how much you want to acknowledge that it's a two-dimensional thing, right? Because like it's totally when you move the camera way off axis with it, it becomes totally obvious that it's, you know, uh a flat thing in 3D space. Whereas if it stays flatter to the camera, the threedimensionality that you've like drawn into it holds up more, right? And so in this case that would mean sort of rotating it down perhaps a little bit so that Mr. Peppermint's head wouldn't get foreshortened by the perspective of the camera. Right? So it would just both there would both be valid decisions. It would just be how you want to treat that you know stylistically throughout the rest of it there. But um yeah those look really cool. It's like a like a Saturday morning cartoon version of Sin City is like the vibe it's it's giving me with the you know like call out colors and everything else being black and white. Have you seen that? >> I want to watch it. Meaning to watch it, >> Jack. Have you seen it? I know the answer to that. >> Nine times out 99 times out of 100 K-pop demon hunters. I want these are all things I want to do. You want to, you need to need to >> the other thing for that because I the very first glance I didn't um I mean I certainly couldn't identify it if you didn't say that that was the Mark Wahlberg model um to do that sort of very distinct reflection thing perhaps. steps. If we come over here, back over to here, you could change some things in compositing, but then also in the shader itself. Here, and this is on here, right? Has something. And we'll make it low roughness there. Um, Just something so that we be able to see it control. Does this have my add-ons have not been staying preferences add-ons node wrangler I know I've enabled this a bunch okay now control shift t control t there we go and so if this goes into here right it sticks to the head like you would see but um if you whatever whatever you want to see in the reflection using this to drive it into there. Let's see. >> Um, and so now if I rotate, see what's going on here? I'm rotating the object. Um, but it's not affecting this. It's as if this I I assigned this to the um scene HDR, but I don't have to I don't have to do that because then it would be affecting the entire scene lighting, right? I can make it just reflections for this by combining these. So yeah, because this I'm notice I'm not running it into the reflection or not running it into the roughness. I'm running it into the base color. And so you could mix it by doing something um if you had another um shader that was, you know, some other color and then you did the mix shader, right? You need the separate node when when you're mix shaders. You can't just use the regular mix node. There's a separate node for that because it takes this stuff into account. And so here, if I had some other image, sure that this is on the actual color channel. And now, right, when I rotate this, right, the reflection is still there. Make sense what we're doing there? Yeah. >> Yeah. Um and so that would give you a lot more um control over trying to get the when we want, you know, for that shot, you know, like either in the alien eyes or, you know, people do that shot all the time with sunglasses, right? Where we see the antagonist in the reflection of the protagonist sunglasses or vice versa or whatever it is. But yeah, the reflection texture coordinates take it and turn it into something that's locked in world space. And as you move the object, it's as if it's being reflected. This is the technique that you they used for a long time before you the computers were able to calculate real reflections of like stuff light bouncing around in the scene is just taking some sort of image and wrapping it around because this is really really really fast compared to trying to do all of that reflection calculation. So that that would be something to check out there. And where's Alex? I thought I got Alex's. There's Jacks.",

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Spider-Verse Inspired Animation Hey, this is Jack with ABC240 and we're going to be taking a look at um all the shot sizes we did for this week. Yeah, this is my grease pencil scene. Um this is the wide shot, my grease pencil scene. So, I was trying to go for that scene in Spiderverse where Miles's at the top of the building and he's jumping off, but I kind of, you know, that was my inspiration. >> You have seen Spiderverse? >> I have. >> Okay. Uh, main technique I used for the uh NPR scene was um drawing onto the object. So, yeah, for all these windows, I I drew onto the object. It's all one object that I duplicated and rotated and stuff to make it look um different. And then I used the object line art and the noise to give it like uh that scribbly that scribbly look along the edges. Yeah. And I didn't do anything for the character special like I just non squiggly line art on him. Uh just to make him kind of stand out more. But yeah, so uh I liked experimenting with the different composition. I I used the uh the lens distortion, the glow, the streaks, um all that good stuff. So yeah, that's my wide shot. Here's the medium shot. just getting uh closer getting pulling closer in, you know, kind of feeling more with the character in a way. You can kind of feel the energy that, you know, he's about to uh about to maybe jump off or, you know, he's looking uh looking over the city. Here he is finally jumping off. So, uh yeah, I had fun playing around with this. Um, I his eyes were uh too realistic, so I cut out u some eyes from like an anime. Put them in the 3D world like in front of his eyes to make them look more um look more animated, I guess. Um, and I added all these uh lines to make look like movement lines or just like just something just give it some extra uh interest. And I did that by making a cone and then drawing on the cone. I originally painted it like >> like that with it with it the lines going up and his head down here. And I rotated the entire cone so that the lines are going um towards the in towards the tip like that because the perspective was weird. Did you have to invert the normals on the cone or did that just work out of the box? >> What do you mean by drawing it? >> Yeah, >> that worked. >> It worked. >> Yeah, because that would be like the inside part of the cone, but I wasn't sure whether the projection would work on the reverse normal, but apparently it does. So if you didn't do that like then >> Well, I drew on the outside of the cone. >> You drew on the outside of the cone. Oh, okay. So like you like zoomed out and then Okay. >> So I thought this this worked better. He's jumping off the edge. And uh I really like the scene. It's really cool. And this is the the close-up shot. So this is the cowboy shot. I was trying to emphasize the um the gun and um some some sort of uh altercation about to uh to happen. And yeah, there's definitely some tension here. And I placed both of them in rule of thirds. make it more cinematic, I guess. Then we've got the medium close-up shot, the MCU universe, and we've got the uh yeah, the creature jumping at the guy now, and he's out of focus. And we got the creature in focus. I thought this was really cool, and I think it works well. Just even even more tension here now. Like, is he going to make it? Is he going to get the shot in time? I don't know. Um and then we got our extreme closeup right here. Um I was trying to do like make it look like uh like a muzzle flash. I think without context you can't really tell. It just looks like a lit up um creature face. So I guess that would be a question like how could I make it look more like a muzzle flash like is like um being casted onto its face. But uh yeah, so I added these eyes and gave them emission. I did the directional blur uh in the comp in the compositing. Tried to make it as detailed as I could using like subdivisions and um messing around with the noise on the textures pretty good. And the blur kind of helps cuz you can't really >> So you did the noise on the texture with this? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Where where did this model come from? >> From Mixmo. >> Oh, this is a mix guy. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Wow. Yeah, it looks really good for a mix guy. So, yeah. Yeah. You up Did you end up doing it on the bump and >> Yeah. Yeah. So, like it had like two different textures and one was like hidden. Like you had to like like it only had like the one object like the character skin. >> We had to like find this like hidden material. There's like two that I didn't know where it was. So, that like messing up at the beginning, but yeah. I I don't know. Yeah, it just worked on that one. I I don't know why. So, but I think I ran the bump instead of the normal map, whatever. >> Yeah. In terms of the lighting, I mean, seeing some sort of, you know, very bright, you know, yeah, like volutric light thing happening here. I mean, we're talking about like just a fraction of a moment in time there. But like and having that the quality of that light be remarkably different than the color of this light because yeah I think it all kind of goes together because this all just seems like it's ambient red light from the eyes you know because it's all the same whereas if you had some you know blue or stronger you know that was casting shadows in the opposite direction that might do read a little bit as muzzle flash >> tell like if it is fully detailed. So, um, and yeah, this is just, uh, pure terror. Pure terror scene. Yeah. And then, um, it was kind of difficult, yeah, to like decide what should be the extreme close-up because, um, character had a gas mask on. So, I wasn't really sure, you know, how I could get a lot of emotion out of his gas mask. Yeah. So, it's really cool working in two different styles because, um, >> you're just not emoting hard enough. >> Um, yeah, there's a lot of different things you got to keep in mind. Like >> the guy who does um, Mando on the Mandalorian, right? It's not, as far as I understand, 99% of the time he has the helmet on. It's not Pedro Pascal. >> No, like it's um I think it's a couple different stunt actors who are doing all the What's that? >> They lied to us. >> I mean, I don't I didn't I didn't go in, >> you know, Pedro Pascal shows up with a cappuccino several months later and just like records records some of his lines uh you know, underneath the helmet. But um yeah, but the their their physical acting with the helmet on is really good. Um >> or at least good enough. >> I took way longer on this even though it's it's you know simpler. I think it's just because um people make realistic models at least on Blender Kit. Um and then you know to do this tune stuff it's kind of like more on you to like kind of make the shaders look good coloring and obviously drawing certain things. But I think yeah, another big big part of this is like compositing. I think compositing was like way more important in these. Like I think this like these like you know kind of cartoonish uh glow and like lens stuff. I think it really Yeah, I think that works really nice. The compositing was really good in in these two to give it like that grungy sort of feel. Yeah, it's hard to focus on like character emotion non-photore realistic I feel like. So, you know, h like adding those eyes like it's just an extra bit you have to do to uh to really get the emotion, make sure the emotion is right. So, yeah. Uh those are all my shot sizes. I really enjoyed doing it. It was a lot of fun to mess around with this uh NPR style. Yeah. And it really gives it a lot of character by by doing that. Cool. Yeah, these are great. um really good sort of hybrid rendering um look here, you know, with the, you know, things that would not go together like the heavy line art plus the chromatic aberration and lens flares and stuff, but like it made it all work and this like looks like a really convincing uh set. Is there a volume here? I feel like this gets a little bit less saturated. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And then this, you know, cutting out the eyes and putting those on there, you know, that's really great. So just, you know, making the shot work, especially for this, you know, these stills that we've been making. Like this is essentially, you know, a um technique for doing, you know, uh concept art slashan animatic slash styles frames, you know, like this. Can I make this one frame look as good as possible? Because often the often the techniques for doing that it's the thing you need to do to make the style frame to get the gig, right? Because like is that technique going to work for like the actual animated movie with this character in it? Like no, not at all. But no one besides people in this room are ever going to care about that, right? just sort of like just making this one image work and then you know worrying about the other stuff when you need to. Right. So really cool. That's great. These look really good. The And are this getting downloaded to a different folder? Is this why I'm running out of room? No, they're not. I don't know why I'm running out. Okay.",
    "transcript_segment": "Hey, this is Jack with ABC240 and we're going to be taking a look at um all the shot sizes we did for this week. Yeah, this is my grease pencil scene. Um this is the wide shot, my grease pencil scene. So, I was trying to go for that scene in Spiderverse where Miles's at the top of the building and he's jumping off, but I kind of, you know, that was my inspiration. >> You have seen Spiderverse? >> I have. >> Okay. Uh, main technique I used for the uh NPR scene was um drawing onto the object. So, yeah, for all these windows, I I drew onto the object. It's all one object that I duplicated and rotated and stuff to make it look um different. And then I used the object line art and the noise to give it like uh that scribbly that scribbly look along the edges. Yeah. And I didn't do anything for the character special like I just non squiggly line art on him. Uh just to make him kind of stand out more. But yeah, so uh I liked experimenting with the different composition. I I used the uh the lens distortion, the glow, the streaks, um all that good stuff. So yeah, that's my wide shot. Here's the medium shot. just getting uh closer getting pulling closer in, you know, kind of feeling more with the character in a way. You can kind of feel the energy that, you know, he's about to uh about to maybe jump off or, you know, he's looking uh looking over the city. Here he is finally jumping off. So, uh yeah, I had fun playing around with this. Um, I his eyes were uh too realistic, so I cut out u some eyes from like an anime. Put them in the 3D world like in front of his eyes to make them look more um look more animated, I guess. Um, and I added all these uh lines to make look like movement lines or just like just something just give it some extra uh interest. And I did that by making a cone and then drawing on the cone. I originally painted it like >> like that with it with it the lines going up and his head down here. And I rotated the entire cone so that the lines are going um towards the in towards the tip like that because the perspective was weird. Did you have to invert the normals on the cone or did that just work out of the box? >> What do you mean by drawing it? >> Yeah, >> that worked. >> It worked. >> Yeah, because that would be like the inside part of the cone, but I wasn't sure whether the projection would work on the reverse normal, but apparently it does. So if you didn't do that like then >> Well, I drew on the outside of the cone. >> You drew on the outside of the cone. Oh, okay. So like you like zoomed out and then Okay. >> So I thought this this worked better. He's jumping off the edge. And uh I really like the scene. It's really cool. And this is the the close-up shot. So this is the cowboy shot. I was trying to emphasize the um the gun and um some some sort of uh altercation about to uh to happen. And yeah, there's definitely some tension here. And I placed both of them in rule of thirds. make it more cinematic, I guess. Then we've got the medium close-up shot, the MCU universe, and we've got the uh yeah, the creature jumping at the guy now, and he's out of focus. And we got the creature in focus. I thought this was really cool, and I think it works well. Just even even more tension here now. Like, is he going to make it? Is he going to get the shot in time? I don't know. Um and then we got our extreme closeup right here. Um I was trying to do like make it look like uh like a muzzle flash. I think without context you can't really tell. It just looks like a lit up um creature face. So I guess that would be a question like how could I make it look more like a muzzle flash like is like um being casted onto its face. But uh yeah, so I added these eyes and gave them emission. I did the directional blur uh in the comp in the compositing. Tried to make it as detailed as I could using like subdivisions and um messing around with the noise on the textures pretty good. And the blur kind of helps cuz you can't really >> So you did the noise on the texture with this? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Where where did this model come from? >> From Mixmo. >> Oh, this is a mix guy. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Wow. Yeah, it looks really good for a mix guy. So, yeah. Yeah. You up Did you end up doing it on the bump and >> Yeah. Yeah. So, like it had like two different textures and one was like hidden. Like you had to like like it only had like the one object like the character skin. >> We had to like find this like hidden material. There's like two that I didn't know where it was. So, that like messing up at the beginning, but yeah. I I don't know. Yeah, it just worked on that one. I I don't know why. So, but I think I ran the bump instead of the normal map, whatever. >> Yeah. In terms of the lighting, I mean, seeing some sort of, you know, very bright, you know, yeah, like volutric light thing happening here. I mean, we're talking about like just a fraction of a moment in time there. But like and having that the quality of that light be remarkably different than the color of this light because yeah I think it all kind of goes together because this all just seems like it's ambient red light from the eyes you know because it's all the same whereas if you had some you know blue or stronger you know that was casting shadows in the opposite direction that might do read a little bit as muzzle flash >> tell like if it is fully detailed. So, um, and yeah, this is just, uh, pure terror. Pure terror scene. Yeah. And then, um, it was kind of difficult, yeah, to like decide what should be the extreme close-up because, um, character had a gas mask on. So, I wasn't really sure, you know, how I could get a lot of emotion out of his gas mask. Yeah.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 22, 2025 Student Feedback: Fast and Furious Analysis >> Hello. Hello. Here are my rendered shots for this week. Starting off with the realism scene. We have the full shot, the cowboy, medium close, and extreme close. And for my grease pencil scene, we have the medium full, medium, and closeup. I think my grease pencil shots work extra well at showing different narrative beats because of how the character progresses through actions as the shots change. The medium pull gives attention to the character and the environment that relates them to each other. The medium shot pulls into the character, and in this instance, the character picked up an object from the environment in the MFS, turning the prop into an extension of the character. And the close-up shot puts emphasis on the emotion the character is portraying and its relevance to the narrative. With the grease pencil scene, I drew the Pikachu parallel to the camera. It was a little awkward drawing with it for the first time, but I did appreciate how it essentially creates like a vector image that you can scale or change in the scene without like artifacting or similar issues. I'm pleased with how my renders turned out, but in the beginning, I was having a hard time coming up with inspiration for what kind of scenes I wanted to set up to demonstrate what shot size can do since I didn't want to just set up any scene and slap different zooms onto them. So, I did what anyone would do in these trying times and I watched three straight Fast and Furious movies. >> Approve. >> That's a straight up extra credit there. That's really great. >> We have someone watching free movies. And >> yeah, >> three straight Fast and Furious movies. And I ended up asking a lot of age-old questions like, \"What is this franchise even about? What is going on?\" And what did Vin Diesel mean by that? And I still have no idea, but it did help me understand how shots can be stylistic choices centered around the focus of the film, such as if lots of your shots are medium close-ups because you're always looking at your characters at the wheel of a car, or how the same shot type can have multiple uses depending on context and intention, and how a wide shot leading into a close shot can build tension and direct focus. And it was actually this exact scene that inspired my real [Laughter] [Music] Special thank you. >> Thanks. >> Mhm. >> These look great. They have like, you know, really like the color, the control of color here. This is a super, you know, strong vibe for the whole scene here. Um, great use of depth of field. You know, these are top-notch and they're ju position to Paul Walker and Tyrese or see I I I see what you're doing there and I appreciate it. Um the the the only thing here is that um I mean I'm I feel like for sure you did Well, I'm not sure if these are MixMo ladies or not. >> They are. >> They are. Yeah. like I I thought thought I recognized her. But um it's going to be a weird situation in real life when I see someone who I reminds me of a Miximo model and I'm like, \"Wait, do I know you?\" That'll be that'll be it'll be even stranger if they're like, \"Well, I kind of look like Remy.\" You know, like that >> me with the mouse character. you're going to walk in with the mouse suit on one day and be like, \"You really look familiar today.\" Um, yeah, because you definitely did something to make the skin work there. And so the only other the only other suggestion I have is that on the extreme closeup um that same thing I suggested to Natalie where putting the Mixmo model in a subdurface might take that um so that the so that the silhouette itself isn't chunky like that because there's nothing else about the image that's really giving it away as you know quoteunquote low poly here. But um that you know that that little bit of that there perhaps. But um yeah, really really great and really good job with the like the way you got the lighting to you clearly spent some time getting the lighting correct so that it really worked on the background of the Pikachu images, which is great. Um yeah, I don't I haven't spent the time to to rank all 10 movies personally. >> Have you watched all 10? >> Is that a Is that a rhetorical question? Of course I've watched all 10. >> Yeah. I mean, I'm old enough to have seen most of these in the theater or I mean I did see all the first five in the theater. Like I just didn't see some of the more recent ones. Um but uh yeah, I mean the these are in the top five for sure. The first these are the first three chron like in our chronology, right? Not the fast and furious chronology there, but um yeah, there's a lot to learn there. Awesome. Is that everybody? I think so. Alex, Gage, Alec, Gavin, Jack, Crimson, Nelly, Misha.

Well, they alternate in terms of shot size, but I've aligned them here in terms of the narrative I was trying to portray. So I started uh with the medium full shot, the cowboy shot to show kind of a more confrontational view between the character and the object of his focus over here. Then I guess we left. Um, we have a medium closeup to show his emotion. Then an extreme closeup to show a point of particular interest, that being him flipping the switch. to emphasize it. Then a closeup to uh show his emotions. Again, I know the face kind of completely changes because uh of the limitations of what assets I had, but and al that also contrasts against the similar medium close-up shot. Although, as you can see, I switched them around to further emphasize the differences between uh the PBR and NPR. Uh then medium shot here to convey his body language and emphasize that the uh switch has indeed been flipped and also a less leading room to transition into the next shot where we have all that behind him. Um, and of course wide shot to portray him and the relation to the rest of the scene. So there wasn't I didn't generally have much difficulty with camera placement or composition. Although the grease pencil objects I found a bit difficult to work with. >> Tell us how you really feel. For one thing, they seemed very computationally expensive and so it with adding outlines on multiple objects had my computer chugging despite it being pretty powerful. Um, and getting I was having trouble even with subdividing and working with with materials and the noise modifiers uh getting them to properly look wavy and uneven. I definitely would have liked to have taken some more time to uh have used a more complex method of converting the models to grease pencil or kind of PBR object instead of just outlining them and giving the kind of threshold effect with the shader. Um, >> yeah, I mean I think your intuition here is valid. like the from a stylistic sense like this I think is striking but then you have the like this because you're kind of thresholding the existing super high um resolution textures that this ends up being like this really noisy thing which doesn't doesn't particularly fit together in this in this scene here.

    "title": "Cryptomat Object Isolation Technique",
    "video_id": "CEff_zgG-b0",
    "search_text": "AVC240 October 22, 2025 Cryptomat Object Isolation Technique The 181 degree rule. [Music] Okay, here we go. We're going to do two things. One is cryptomat. This is not some sort of shady currency to invest in. It's a way to isolate um objects in the render. And then we'll look at um the video editor in Blender and how that sort of interfaces with our camera setups slash how that's affecting our whole editing how we think about editing here, right? because it's a little more complicated and that we can do all of this kind of at one time where we're animating and editing at the same time in a way that doesn't happen in real life for the reasons that we discussed on Monday. You have to have multiple camera setups. Cameras can't be in a way of other cameras. None of that matters to us and so we can do it in this more holistic way, but it's not without its complications. Let's do this first cryptomat. Um, and so in this instance, first of all, I'm in five, the preview for five because I figured out I could launch that sort of around on the school computer. And so this down here, I know looks different. And so that may look a little bit different, but even if you stay in four, five, all this should still be true. Um, so what's the cryptomat? It allows us, you know, say we want to um isolate Michelle for a little bit different um color correction or effect in the render, right? And so if this were real life footage, the option would pretty much be um chroma either using a either having Michelle shot against a chroma key background to be able to isolate her from the background or rotoscoping which is is exactly what it sounds like. It's just tracing Michelle out of this with the mat every frame. and very painstaking slow work. But that would be if we were shot shooting in real life. Since we're here, all of these are separate objects to the computer. And so the computer can automatically in the system can generate a mask for any of them which can then be used in compositing. And so that's what the cryptomat is. Um the general workflow here is that you need to enable cryptomat. Uh this is in the view uh area tab. Uh and then we access it with the crypto mat um node which then we use to mask uh the object and this is actually implemented in a really elegant way in blender. So let's look at that. Um let's come back to layout and use the cryptomat. So we come over here to view layer and yeah this is where these are the different components of the render. These are you can think about these as different layers that get added together. We'll look at more of them coming up. And so you had to enable the Z um in order to resolve some of those issues in the compositing of the grease pencil objects. But now we're going to come down here to cryptomat and go to object for now. Uh so yeah, you can uh isolate objects or materials. And we're just going to go with um objects for now. And that's good. And so now I'll save and come back over to uh compositing. And now my render layers have these additional outputs here. Right? Up until now we've just been harvesting the single image that comes out of here. But there's a lot of different parts of the image you could uh take care of. So uh I will shift a and bring in a cryptomat. Not the legacy one. The one that doesn't say legacy. And let's look at this by itself. So I'll disconnect this and just use the viewer over here. And so if we go to the um this is a little bit confusing in that you can either send the image into it or um or not. And we are not. We're going to just leave it on render. And then let's come and hook that up for now. Um, you can just hit plus and then that should allow you, if we have this set to the appropriate scene, we do. Let's render again.",
    "transcript_segment": "The 181 degree rule. [Music] Okay, here we go. We're going to do two things. One is cryptomat. This is not some sort of shady currency to invest in. It's a way to isolate um objects in the render. And then we'll look at um the video editor in Blender and how that sort of interfaces with our camera setups slash how that's affecting our whole editing how we think about editing here, right? because it's a little more complicated and that we can do all of this kind of at one time where we're animating and editing at the same time in a way that doesn't happen in real life for the reasons that we discussed on Monday. You have to have multiple camera setups. Cameras can't be in a way of other cameras. None of that matters to us and so we can do it in this more holistic way, but it's not without its complications. Let's do this first cryptomat. Um, and so in this instance, first of all, I'm in five, the preview for five because I figured out I could launch that sort of around on the school computer. And so this down here, I know looks different. And so that may look a little bit different, but even if you stay in four, five, all this should still be true. Um, so what's the cryptomat? It allows us, you know, say we want to um isolate Michelle for a little bit different um color correction or effect in the render, right? And so if this were real life footage, the option would pretty much be um chroma either using a either having Michelle shot against a chroma key background to be able to isolate her from the background or rotoscoping which is is exactly what it sounds like. It's just tracing Michelle out of this with the mat every frame. and very painstaking slow work. But that would be if we were shot shooting in real life. Since we're here, all of these are separate objects to the computer. And so the computer can automatically in the system can generate a mask for any of them which can then be used in compositing. And so that's what the cryptomat is. Um the general workflow here is that you need to enable cryptomat. Uh this is in the view uh area tab. Uh and then we access it with the crypto mat um node which then we use to mask uh the object and this is actually implemented in a really elegant way in blender. So let's look at that. Um let's come back to layout and use the cryptomat. So we come over here to view layer and yeah this is where these are the different components of the render. These are you can think about these as different layers that get added together. We'll look at more of them coming up. And so you had to enable the Z um in order to resolve some of those issues in the compositing of the grease pencil objects. But now we're going to come down here to cryptomat and go to object for now. Uh so yeah, you can uh isolate objects or materials. And we're just going to go with um objects for now. And that's good.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 22, 2025 Compositing Workflow and Alpha Channels There we go. If something's not working in the compositing view, render another frame. That updates whatever pixels we're dealing with. And then that seems to do it. And so here um if I pick Michelle who uh object name is character three right now or the mesh is um now if we were to look at what's coming out of this mat here. Boom. That's what this is doing. And so you can generate a super clean mask that respects motion blur and depth of field. meaning that the mask itself will be blurry where it's supposed to be blurry, which is uh not insignificant. We're not really leveraging that right now, but uh yeah, it gives us this really clean mask of uh Michelle. And so now we can use that. I'm going to delete this other stuff to not um confuse the issue. And so um so how can we isolate Michelle here using this mat? We can use the alpha um set alpha. And so the image goes in here, the mat goes in there. And now if we look at the output, it's that which is masked. Michelle Michelle's not wearing a mask. Jesus masked out from the background. Um, and then, um, let's do something to And just for the sake of I'm just going to do something dramatic just so that it's clear what's happening visually here. Okay. So, we've done some sort of processing on Michelle. Um, how do we get her back into the actual image? Um, we have to comp this over top of the image that's here. And so that is going to be we're not going to use the mix node for this. We're going to use the alpha over because we're not mixing anything here. We just simply want this this has an alpha channel. We just simply want to lay it on top of the background image. And so, uh, the background and then the foreground. And then this goes over here. And boom, I've turned Michelle into the Hulk. She-Hulk. There we go. There. That's pretty good. Um, so set alpha. Cryptomat is gives us the you know this is step one create the mask that's what the cryptomat object does when you have it set to render which is the default I didn't change that and then I just to get that color picker you press plus but it's actually not a color picker it's a object picker right that you'll see it change there's a little name next to it you'll see it change and so um then you supply that and then the thing that's hitting mast comes out of the mass output. The set alpha is essentially just cutting it out. And so that's step two. Step three is to do something to it. That's the whole point of using the mask. And so in this case, we color corrected it into this and then um comped it back in over top of the original image as the foreground. There's the complete image and this comes back in like so. And this would obviously want to go to both outputs. So it goes to both of those. There we go. Hulk andor scroll Michelle has been turned into. So this should be um the value proposition I think should be clear here right. Uh so we can do a lot of things like for instance let's do um we'll do a typical thing. We'll make our character saturated and our background desaturated. Right. Uh so let's go ahead and get another cryptomat here. I need some more space. I'm going to do that and then zoom out. That's that control spacebar. And so cryptomat uh this and I'll save incremental. There we go. This is the 182 degree rule now. And so over here we want to get Amy. And so plus there we go. character that gives me Amy's mat. And so if we look at this one, just to check. Oh, not the image. We want the mat. Oh, cool. Is that the default or did I click twice? Oh, we don't need two cryptomats. We can just simply add more objects to the mat. Beautiful. I didn't do that when I was testing it out. That makes things a little bit simpler. So, we got this mat for two. Um, and so let's come in here and we have our hue saturation value. And so again, we'll run this into here, this into here. There we go. We have them isolated. And let's put this in there. And so we can make them really pop off of this. And then the background. We will do the opposite. Crl + Crl + V. Bring this here. The image. This goes into here. And we will desaturate said background. Then we will comp. Let's get rid of this thing. Not that thing. This thing. And then comp this in here, this in here, and this to here. And yeah, we can do this. Right. So there it is. Completely black and white background like so. Um, we could artificially uh treat our depth of field, although this, you know, isn't optically correct. here. If we add uh a blur here to the background and save. Right. [Music] All right. So, the even more of a difference between and so this gives us a really uh you know this is a pretty standard technique in that we got these characters that are much more saturated up here. We could take this further and again save and maybe give our characters um a different kind of look here with the um one of the MPR shaders there or effects. The this is the same algorithm that's in the new Substance Painter now. And so, uh, depending on how far you'd want to go with that, but now they sort of have this painterly look in the foreground or maybe you'd want to experience experiment with that being the background. And so, uh, characters stay clear, but then the background gets this more uh, jibly gibbly-esque effect there. Um, in terms of the painterliness of the background. Um, yeah, I like that. right in terms of separating those things. Um, yeah. So, cryptomat super powerful here. Keep it in. It's a little bit different in that the source is not coming from here. You're grabbing your own mat and you could have multiple objects selected there. Set alpha is the new one. And then alpha over is also a new one here. Although in this case um yeah okay that's good. Let's leave it at that for now. But makes sense there right? And obviously this the flame issue you were having right where you want to add glow on the flame. This is the doorway into that. The only issue there, I mean, give it a shot later. You maybe separating out that flame as a separate grease pencil object would make this easier, but we'll we'll look, but that that would be part of the part of the flow here, right? And and then we want some cool glints on Michelle's glasses, right? And so shift shift a glare, right? And maybe this comes into here. Let's look at this by itself. There we go. And um So then uh depending what we want to do here with the hue, saturation value and the glare. Maybe we mix these together. So this on this maybe in the add blend mode. Let's see what that looks like. There we go. And then this becomes our new foreground. And this is what we're seeing over here. Right. And so all of this, you know, white stuff in the background is not activating that glare in the same way. Nice. Okay, that's that cryptomat. Super useful compositing wise. Here, let's make the compositing even more useful. Um,",

Um, we want to be able to have separate compositing for separate shots. So, um, the structure here is a little wonky. This may get better in the future, but for now the way it would work is that each the principle to understand here is that each compositing each scene in Blender has its own compositing node setup. Up until now, we've just been using one scene in Blender. Everything's been in one scene. And so this is where this is going to get a little convoluted in terms of scenes and shots. Uh the most flexible situation if you wanted the maximum flexibility in compositing each shot would become a scene. This would give you the um max flexibility. In many instances, this is probably not necessary, but this would be the max way. The the part about this that's a little bit backwards right now. The way that this is implemented is that you would still want to I think the best workflow is going to be set up shots meaning the cameras in a single scene and then uh duplicate to get more compositing setups. The thing that is also a little bit conceptually strange is that these scenes need to get sequenced. in another scene because each scene has its own um video editor. So that's is this is the way Blender the scene is king in Blender. And so each scene that's like at the top of the um outlined data structure, hierarchical data structure. The scene is at the top and then each scene has its own layout, compositing, video editing, whatever, whatever, whatever. And so in order to take a bunch of other scenes and put them together, you need to make an like essentially an empty scene just for editing. [Music] Okay, those are the guiding principles. Let's see how this works out. So, we're going to set up some super stuff. This is this is uh cube scene. Okay. So, >> yeah, the classic. Um, let's give just for the sake of being able to see what's happening some distinct colors here. Here we go. Um, now making more scenes is up here. And uh you can double click here to name this. We'll call this cube scene. And when you click on this button right which is always make another thing in Blender uh it gives you some options here. So the options are a totally new blank scene, a scene that will change when the original scene like an instance of the scene or copy the scene but the copy is separate, right? And so uh this is the difference between this one is equivalent to uh alt d which gives us the instance and this one is equivalent to shift d which gives us an independent copy. Okay. And so we're going to be using um shift d here. Uh, so I'll say full copy. And here we are. And I'm going to delete I'm in cube scene one, which I will immediately rename to sphere scene. [Music] And delete the cube. Make a sphere. Give this sphere a different color. Okay. and um that's good. Let's just make a third one. This one we'll do from scratch. And this is a little bit peculiar, but if you say new, it gives you a totally blank scene, which doesn't unless you've set Blender up to do this, doesn't happen at any other point. Um, and so this may be a little bit um just just to know there's some gotchas here is that you need to bring in a camera and you need to bring in a light, right? the things that Blender usually has set up for you so that you don't run into this that even if I put something in here like a cylinder, uh you wouldn't see it unless you got this other stuff set up here um because it's totally totally blank.

Let's look at sphere scene is very interesting because you can't tell if there's a hole in the middle of the cylinder or that's just the top of it. >> Yeah. >> This there's going to be a lot of this movie is going to raise a lot of questions. Um, okay. That's weird. When you switch scenes, it still shows you the image from the other scene. So, I'm not sure if that's going to be the case at all. It doesn't seem like seems like something that might get fixed. Anyway, um, here we are in sphere scene. And so, let's give this one the lens distortion. There we go. The And then let's look at uh cube scene. again. If you're not seeing anything here, F12 and then that should update. And um here we'll add the pixelate thing. Okay, just so that we can tell that the compositing is happening to each one. Okay. Um there we go.

We'll address try and look at this in the bigger scene in a second. But um now this is the gotcha. Create a new blank scene for the editing of the other scenes. That's a little awkward, but I I mean, if you think about the hierarchy here, everything needs to happen in a scene. That's important. And so here, when it comes time to actually edit these things together, I'll make a new scene and I'll use the new totally blank. Then I'll come over to the video editing video editing space.

I didn't think it was like We've got this extra scene here cuz I made the one labeled editing. Okay. All right. I didn't do anything except I went back to the layout and just gave it somewhere to render. Okay. Um, as for why I ended up with this extra scene here, something had happened. What I meant to do was rather put this in the editing one where Oh. Oh. Um, editing. Yes. Okay. That's where I went wrong. Okay. I I was thinking this was creating a new video editor, but the video editor is there. This is still creating a new scene. And so in Yeah, you don't need to add a new one here. You just need to select editing. Then then um you should be able to bring in the stuff. There we go. If we look at each one, now uh up here under it's a little we're not rendering this editing scene because the editing scene actually doesn't have a camera in it. We're going to using the slightly different Render sequence. And if we look that showed up on the other one, it's going through and it is giving us the rendered version of all of these and if it goes through. So essentially each of these represents the output from that scene and its length. So in our case, like with our just scene that we made on Monday, we have all the cameras set up. And if we want to do something different for the compositing at some point, we'll create one duplicate scene. So we can have two compositing setups. We're not going to do it for each shot in our case to try and keep it a little bit simpler here, but um yeah, it could be either way. Again, the most flexibility would be that you would set up the camera and the scene, you know, build everything, animate everything, and then set up one camera per scene. That would give you the most, you know, flexibility within the entire thing at that point. Um, and so this is going to render this out as an MP4. I just have it going to a movie right now where we're sequencing from here to here to here. This um is a reasonable but you know not super fully featured editor. We can you know put things on top of each other. We can mask things out to some extent but most of the fun compositing stuff would be done in the compositing view but you could have multiple layers of stuff. And just like you know Premiere or After Effects or anything you can slide them around and sequence things and lengthen them or cut them down. Right? So somewhere, you know, combining the Premiere workflow with what we did on Monday with the cameras there. The confusing part being that we have to have this extra scene that's just for compositing the other scenes together. That's the part that gets a little conceptually awkward. So, if we look at this with our um scene, our project that we did on",
    "transcript_segment": "here we have this cylinder scene. Um, there we go. And just so we can tell that the compositing is working, I'm just going to add a blur. And there we go. Cylinder is out of focus. Um, save. Let's look at sphere scene is very interesting because you can't tell if there's a hole in the middle of the cylinder or that's just the top of it. >> Yeah. >> This there's going to be a lot of this movie is going to raise a lot of questions. Um, okay. That's weird. When you switch scenes, it still shows you the image from the other scene. So, I'm not sure if that's going to be the case at all. It doesn't seem like seems like something that might get fixed. Anyway, um, here we are in sphere scene. And so, let's give this one the lens distortion. There we go. The And then let's look at uh cube scene. again. If you're not seeing anything here, F12 and then that should update. And um here we'll add the pixelate thing. Okay, just so that we can tell that the compositing is happening to each one. Okay. Um there we go. And so that's cube scene. cylinder scene and sphere scene each with their own compositing spaces to take care of. Now, um we'll come back to layout and this is the key when it comes time to actually edit. We're each scene is just going to have one camera for now, right? We'll address try and look at this in the bigger scene in a second. But um now this is the gotcha. Create a new blank scene for the editing of the other scenes. That's a little awkward, but I I mean, if you think about the hierarchy here, everything needs to happen in a scene. That's important. And so here, when it comes time to actually edit these things together, I'll make a new scene and I'll use the new totally blank. Then I'll come over to the video editing video editing space. Now that I'm here, I can for my own sanity. Reabel this scene first. This will be editing. So that that I know what's what. Now back over here. Yeah, I'm in the editing scene strip. We need to say new. Then we can add our other scenes here. Right? So add scene. Cube scene. Here's the cube scene as it exists. Add. Here's the cylinder scene. Add sphere scene. And if we The only confusing thing here is why we're not seeing the rendered version. We're just seeing the solid version. Dang it. Okay. How did it add this extra scene?

So there I made a component of the component and so now the other one changes with that one. Okay, so that was a little confusing there, right? So you can't drag the primitive into the component. You have to drag the primitives container into the component. Now it's in the component and so that gets duplicated. [Music] And then let's see. Okay. I'm not quite sure why. Oh, because I don't have this. Yeah. [Music] >> Oh, really? Looks like it. I'm glad I don't have homework due on Mondays so I'm not fielding 7,000 emails from students about like >> I can't do it. It's It's down. Yeah, campus is back. All that homework you've been itching to do all day, now you can do it."

It's gonna work uh levels on the metallic. And I want it to be on the metallic side, but just a little bit of variation in there. There we go. Um, and in the roughness and fold this back up. There we go. Turn the roughness on. bring this in. So, I'm trying to adjust the tiling here to get it to like a rough scale that works. And then I'll use the tiling for the layer independently to sort of scale the whole thing. And so again, especially in using the high contrast noises, having the levels to get this worked out, roughness And then I might use a similar pattern maybe for some of this height detail.

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 20, 2025 Anchor Points and Layer Management Cool. Okay. So, let's use this now. Let's use it on some height stuff here. And so, yeah, we have the typical height here or we could start to layer things on top. So, for instance, we want the height. We want to mask this. We want the mask to read the stuff below. So when you're reading an anchor point and trying to get the whole all the stuff up, a lot of times it's a fill effect that's then pointed at the anchor point to give us the height effect there. Right there it is without that. But now that that's there uh again we can uh address it. Putting the levels there is putting the levels on the mask which not what we want. Let's go to the levels on the height data itself. Although actually Let's break this up a little bit. So instead of, you know, it all being one, there's like multiple levels coming in from the mask itself, but then you could use this on top of other things. So for instance, This is going to go on to the height here. Let's give it way more of an amount. And then levels on top of that. Right. So we have the thing that we painted sort of masking this in. Right. Especially from this detail, it's giving us this, you know, combination of stuff there. The square pattern is really distinct. So, in the tile generator color, making these things a little bit more closer to gray. It gives us a combination of those things. And let's see if we can use that a little bit further. And here, yeah, this is just dealing with height, not color. And so this is like height complexity. There we go. And then we want some of this to be emissive. So, same kind of thing. Um another one here emission complexity and over here remember we have to add the emission channel and we have that or instead of having it be the same we can have it get um noise. And so our scale here. There we go. Tiny dots. tinier and then mask and we'll have the mask read the anchor point. So, but first the this is the kind of thing where a node would be easier or at least I think make a little more sense. But it's also hard to see them unless they're unfolded here. But here we're grabbing that same thing. And then over here, maybe we want some more contrast on this on theive. There we go. And so we want the this is one case where we want the dark to be really really dark and we want the bright to be really really bright but we just want to skew it so we're getting like just dots in there like that. And then um yeah, depending on how it's going to give us that sort of like tiny window effect that's on there. And then maybe in the main thing here, we're filling in some sort of color. some sort of roughness. All right. So, especially from a distance and once there's some other base on there can give us a lot of tiny detail. Right. So all of those little if we wanted more or less of those up here in the emission details we have this and say we wanted to edit this further just have those lights in some places. Uh we could add another fill on top and so another fill and put it in multiply blend mode which will black it out. And then you could choose where to bring it in with the hard brush here. Oh, no, not fill. Uh, you want to paint it. So, you need a not paint layer, but paint effect. So, let's delete that one. Yeah, over here. So, paint in multiply to darken. There we go. And now make sure we're painting black. And that should get rid of it in certain areas depending on where you'd want to do that. And so for instance in these things here making that very shiny. But coming back over here, right? So, storing, you know, with the complex thing I want to paint in this mask allows me to super flexibly play with it, layering things on top, not having to be to constrain to, you know, like because there's a bunch of stuff like say I want the lights to be smaller, right? All right. So, if I come back here to what I did with this and I just start to turn up the tiling, I'm able to um make the lights I'm able to affect just that, right?

So, paint in, you know, for super then, you know, I would probably organize this stuff because it's going to start to be a bunch of layers. So, if I bring this back in, I would put this into a folder here. And this is, you know, uh, paint detail. And then, you know, I can take all this stuff and dump it in here. It's super flexible. If I want to start doing more stuff like this on the ship, I just come back down to the original mass that's feeding into the anchor point, and it all feeds back up, right? And so if I want to add more of this kind of stuff here, make sure you're painting white into the mask. I had set to black before. Okay. So, there we go. There it comes up through all of the other stuff. And if anybody's had a chance to check out that light and magic, you know, one of the stories on that about industrial light and magic and the very beginning of doing Star Wars is, you know, that they made the windows one size on the big Death Star model and then someone came in and said the window should be smaller. And so then like three weeks later after three weeks of work of making all the windows twice as small, then they were able to film, you know, the final Luke run on the Starship. Fortunately, we're not so um constrained here, right? And so, this could be another thing. Let's add a fill layer here. And this is going to be Death Star lights. And um we'll put make these emissive for now. And we'll mask it out. And the tiling generator here. It It's kind of innocuous and it just looks like um a bunch of squares, but it's a pretty deep procedural thing. Um and so actually we need to go to fill on this on the mask and then bring in a tile generator. There we go. And so there we go. That's week one. There we go. There. Now you may get it so small that's like here. We don't want it that small because then we'll just run together. Um, yeah. So, there's quite a bit of scrolling down to be doing here. Ender size position. Um, yeah, position random X offset starts to randomly change these. Position awesome Y offset. the color. So, random mask starts to cut some of these out, right? And so, we're death star right away there with that one. The other thing is I want to sharpen up the edge of it. And so position, contrast, Y amount, pattern, scale, tiling, uh, And then, right, we could bring these in or out with the height of this. I mean, I kind of like it when we randomize them in one direction. So here there we go. Now they seem like they're in line. It's a little bit more All right. Very, you know, like this is super star destroyer just just by doing that, right? gives me a bunch of of that and okay so this is in the mask for this right so it's masks all the way down, right? In just just the same conceptually the same thing that Arinka was showing us in Substance Modeler, right? Cutting the cutter, masking the mask, that's masking the mask, right? Like that kind of right because here I built this stuff in the mask on this layer. But now I don't want these lights everywhere, but the mask is making the lights. And so now this goes in a folder and then I that gives me another layer of mask to deal with. Right? So I'm masking the mask here. And this one now I can use in my, you know, um, as long as I'm painting white in this one here. And I want to be in yeah, we'll say UV chunk fill. And so now I can bring that in, you know, exactly where I want on some parts. No problem. When you're in um polygon fill, this gets everybody clicking is filling one. The moment you click and drag, it projects through the mesh and gets the other side. You can just get one side if you scroll in and click. And in this case with this like pretty simple geometry, that's fine. If you've got some sort of model with like a ton of geometry, that tends to be you need to solve it in a different way. But this allows us to do that so that we could bring it in in, you know, like one particular area and Then when I come out of this like here, I've just got those tiny windows in just those sections there for what I've got.",
    "transcript_segment": "Okay, cool. So, paint in, you know, for super then, you know, I would probably organize this stuff because it's going to start to be a bunch of layers. So, if I bring this back in, I would put this into a folder here. And this is, you know, uh, paint detail. And then, you know, I can take all this stuff and dump it in here. It's super flexible. If I want to start doing more stuff like this on the ship, I just come back down to the original mass that's feeding into the anchor point, and it all feeds back up, right? And so if I want to add more of this kind of stuff here, make sure you're painting white into the mask. I had set to black before. Okay. So, there we go. There it comes up through all of the other stuff. And if anybody's had a chance to check out that light and magic, you know, one of the stories on that about industrial light and magic and the very beginning of doing Star Wars is, you know, that they made the windows one size on the big Death Star model and then someone came in and said the window should be smaller. And so then like three weeks later after three weeks of work of making all the windows twice as small, then they were able to film, you know, the final Luke run on the Starship. Fortunately, we're not so um constrained here, right? And so, this could be another thing. Let's add a fill layer here. And this is going to be Death Star lights. And um we'll put make these emissive for now. And we'll mask it out. And the tiling generator here. It It's kind of innocuous and it just looks like um a bunch of squares, but it's a pretty deep procedural thing. Um and so actually we need to go to fill on this on the mask and then bring in a tile generator. There we go. And so there we go. That's week one. There we go. There. Now you may get it so small that's like here. We don't want it that small because then we'll just run together. Um, yeah. So, there's quite a bit of scrolling down to be doing here. Ender size position. Um, yeah, position random X offset starts to randomly change these. Position awesome Y offset. the color. So, random mask starts to cut some of these out, right? And so, we're death star right away there with that one. The other thing is I want to sharpen up the edge of it. And so position, contrast, Y amount, pattern, scale, tiling, uh, And then, right, we could bring these in or out with the height of this. I mean, I kind of like it when we randomize them in one direction. So here there we go. Now they seem like they're in line. It's a little bit more All right. Very, you know, like this is super star destroyer just just by doing that, right? gives me a bunch of of that and okay so this is in the mask for this right so it's masks all the way down, right? In just just the same conceptually the same thing that Arinka was showing us in Substance Modeler, right? Cutting the cutter, masking the mask, that's masking the mask, right?

So mass again, anchor points and masks kind of like advancedish techniques, but you you can just they're kind of simple. Anchor point is just reading data from something below, which allows you to just sort of like paint once and then just reference that for everything else. Um, let's look here. The other thing I wanted to show you here is that you have probably at this point noticed that there is a bunch of normal stamps here like this stuff, Right? And so I mean now you obviously identify that as like okay that's normal channel stuff right because it's clear it's the blue normal channel color right how do I use this stuff so I need to go into a paint layer and we want to you know Clear this out. We just want to be painting normal information. Then in our clear out the alpha in here. Bring this in. And so now, yeah. And so you think it would go into the alpha, but alphas are just black and white. Okay. And so you're putting it into the normal channel. And so here, um, now I can use this to create yet another, you know, pretty significant level of detail if we want to have this be a little bit different. So we I believe this works if I remember correctly. If we make it metallic here okay that it's not respecting the alpha channel in the normal Oh, [Music] Okay, super cool. What happened? Let me do it from scratch. uh those stamps. The the downside is that the the normal stamp clearly has an alpha channel or at least it's displayed as such here that's been asking this stuff out, right? But when you just say, \"Hey, I want to paint this on a paint layer.\" Um the color channel doesn't get masked out. So for instance, that's why this happens, right? So I don't get the shape masked out because of this alpha channel situation. And so what I just did there was I I you know used an anchor point on the same layer. And so the anchor point in this case is on the paint and then it is referencing where we're painting which is the normal channel and then it's in the mask on the channel which I added. It reads the normal and that lets us paint use that that normal channel thing to paint this stuff in with uh a different with color as you would want, right? Because even if I change this out to some other shape here, same deal. Not good, right? So this is going to be normal stamps. Uh normal decals. Stamping is actually a separate thing. So the Substance Painter does use the word stamping for a different thing. I'll show you here in a second. So normal decals. Uh good. Okay. So now we'll paint some normal stuff. these guys. I'll drag this into the normal channel and we'll paint color and we will rotate this to orient it and come in like so. Kind of but not exactly what we want, right? Um so we right click and we say add black mask. That gets it away totally. Now we come back over here to the paint. Right click, add anchor, normal decals. That's all you need. Come back over here to the mask. Add a fill. Add a fill. Read the anchor point. Normal decals. The same layer. Right. So you can read it on the same layer or above not below. Uh but here we need to be a little bit more discerning than we've been with anchor points in the past and that what where is the information you want to send up here right so yeah because before when I done anchor points we've done it and when I just did it I was doing it with a mask a mask is just one channel it's just black and white information end of story and so I believe correctly the anchor point reading doesn't give you this option right there is no choice of where do you want to get the information from because there's only one place to get the information from. That's a one channel mask. Now I put the anchor point on the layer itself. And a layer as we know now has many many many channels. And so which ch where do you want to get this information from? And so here uh you can set up different fills to read different layers. But here we're going to read the normal information. And boom, there we go. That does what we want there. And so now with that set up, we can just simply switch these out to be able to, you know, dial in what kind of like let's make some black rubber things like this. And these would go here. Right. And so here this is this is super fun because I mean modeling like just that that would be a total nightmare, right? In terms of like handling all of these circular indents and all of the you know uh to make enough topology to make them circular but not enough here. And so now we're able to do that. I could change it to some other color. Let's say it doesn't have color and it just has emission. Right? This is fairly destructive here. But let's say that they're kind of like bluish lights kind of like this. And we bring this up as a different thing over here. And these guys are going into here. And boom. Right. And that's that's there. And I can put those There. Turn that off. Go back to color. Forgot to sub that out. The only downside here is it doesn't give you much of a preview in terms of the stamp there. And then the overall strength of these things. Um, even though it's a paint layer, you can come into the normal channel. And the best the biggest slider to handle here is this, right? And so this can sort of dial this in. Now, especially with a normal channel, you know, maybe not having it cranked to 100, especially if it's going to animate going to give you a little less flickery.

And so what what that exported there was this folder. Um there we go. And we've had this work most of the time. There were some instances where it didn't work, but I can't quite remember what the deal was there. Right. And so it makes a bunch of things here. The thing to focus in on is this one, the USD file, universal scene description. There's other This is referencing a bunch of It's referencing all the materials. It's ref It's referencing all the textures. It's referencing this material setup. And this is the geometry, I believe. Um, so this uh USD, not geoD, is the thing I'm dragging into Blender. And with node, yeah, you can tell when something's just like a a database that references other"

I'm also going to take my render settings here and let's go to ultra wide like that. I'm sort of going back and forth about the scale of this here, but let's see. like that. Okay. Um, for now, let's save. Let's grab maybe Nebula or something for the background. So, the HDR if we are going to see it in the background here. And if we look for space, not the ones with the planets. That's not going to look quite right. And NASA may also be useful here, but let's see. and go 4096 here on this. That's better. And again, remember to adjust this under world and then down here under rotation Z. It's gonna allow you to sort of art direct the cosmos. That's the, you know, theme for the semester. Now, um, let's add some of this atmosphere. Uh, a couple different ways to do this. Let's see. Let's go ahead and take our sphere here, which is now a planet. And then we will um control C control + V the planet. And then we will call this atmosphere. And then uh on atmosphere we will give ourselves a different material. So let's get rid of that and make a new material. And on this material we want to have just the edge of it there. So the atmosphere, if we look at this, is remember I did all the scaling up in edit mode. So this isn't some sort of wacky number. It's just one, right? And so now I want the atmosphere to be just above it. Well, actually, let's just leave it where it is and see how it combines first. Um, let's let's come back to here. Let's call this atmosphere. And uh in this Come back to object. So we're looking at that and let's look at this. So we need a couple things here. The big thing that's going to get this job done is Frenel.

And so then we'll take this into the um we'll take the color and bring it down. And then we'll grab the emission because we want this to be kind of glowing and bring that in here. Again, I'm going full screen on this with this control spacebar shortcut thing. And so now uh under strength, you can sort of see as I sort of dial it in like kind of what's happening there. And so uh if I turn this up a bunch and then start to really push this there, I can start to get this um and we want to change to a softer amount. There we go. Strength. Um, that's giving us that, but we still don't see the planet underneath. And that's because we need to cut this out with the alpha channel. And so this should help us in both case. We should be able to run this from here to here as well. Then May need to ramp the ramp here. This goes to here. This goes to here. Okay, my suspicions were correct there. So, I made the atmosphere just ever so slightly bigger than the planet. Um, and so now if I put this in here. There we go. Okay.

Do you remember >> to get this smaller? Okay. Anyways, this is what we're seeing in the viewer. It's actually in in a window here behind it. Alt grab gives us that. Can I Can I click here and zoom out or something? What sort of random combination of hot keys does this to me? Okay. Does it tell me what [Music] Okay. V for zoom. It brings it in. Or you can just press N and use the zoom slider, which seems to make more sense there. Anyways, so that makes it just a little bit easier to see. Yeah, the fact that the nodes are over top of the render. I mean, I guess it makes sense from like, you know, just can be a little bit tough to wrangle there. Anyways, one of the things we definitely want to have is in space, right? You can't hear anyone scream in space, but you definitely see things glow. And so, we want to have glare. In Blender, glow is glare. And so, here's some glare. And we want to um put this in. And you see how this immediately starts to give us kind of what we want there in the atmosphere. And then the strength of this can max out at one. But the let's go to bloom. There we go. and in four. So the threshold here is like how bright does something need to be to start to get glow. And so the lower that number goes, the more things that glow. So there'll be a balance between what you need to have this number set to and then what value this is. Okay. So if this is higher um why can't I see it in this view in my layout? Because you have to come over here and say compositor in the camera. And now you'll see it over here in the space view in the this view here. Uh, this even at 4K looks a little soft in the background, especially for space. Um, and so you could come back over here and fudge some of this with our scale here in terms of, you know, in the X and Y. Trying to find some ways to get some more pixels on the screen there because it's space. And so if it's a little distorted here, you can probably make it work, right? And so that works there. Now we're getting some of that glow on our atmosphere. Let's look at some more reference here. So, we have a brighter spot over here. We have some lens flaring going on. Maybe something there. So this um kind of thing we could art direct in there and depending on the size of it, we have our clouds that we can put in like we did previously. Um and so let's come back to our atmosphere here. And you guys still hearing me there on the um live stream. Let's come back to here. Here our atmosphere. Come back over here. And now that we have the glow, the glare in place, we could probably dial this in. We could also start to do something maybe more nuanced over here. Right. So, we could control-click to get another node. Maybe start to give it some sort of other color value there to make that a little bit more interesting. Maybe this is in here. And maybe control-click here. And if we didn't want this to be quite so perfect here, you could composite in some noise on the Fresnel. So, let's get our friend pearlin noise in here. Let's make it um just so I can see it to dial in some of the All right. All right. So, we can break it up here and under is at zero and then dial that up just to get some fading break up there. And then let's go ahead and multiply this by this. And so, shift a color mix color. Bring this in. Here's this one and this one. And we want to multiply. And then yeah, this goes into here, which goes into here. Here, and deleting this. There we go. Right. So, the, you know, turning the min up and down here kind of allows me to decide how much of this I want in there. They're just breaking up the noise. The other thing you might want to try",
    "transcript_segment": "compositing but we come over to compositing here. Have we done compositing in this class? No we didn't do with the playground. Right. So we'll come over to compositing which allows us to do a lot of like the After Effects stuff in Blender. And in 44 in 45 you should see something here after you click use nodes. But um this is what is going to get output. And we also need a viewer here, right? So this is going to be you know Blender wants to be nodes all the way down now. And so like there's compositing nodes, geometry nodes, shader nodes, physics nodes, it's all there. And so let's render. You have to do one render to get an image there to see. And what is the zoom on the image? I did it the other day, but now I forget. Anybody remember? Do you remember >> to get this smaller? Okay. Anyways, this is what we're seeing in the viewer. It's actually in in a window here behind it. Alt grab gives us that. Can I Can I click here and zoom out or something? What sort of random combination of hot keys does this to me? Okay. Does it tell me what [Music] Okay. V for zoom. It brings it in. Or you can just press N and use the zoom slider, which seems to make more sense there.

And so the sort of minimum here would be an idle, you know, a walk, run, perhaps both, and a jump. Um and those essentially take the form of separate uh FBX files and those get loaded into Unity. Over here coming out of Substance Painter, we have uh what what comes out of Substance Painter is going to be the PNG textures. And so that's your, you know, your color, uh, roughness for some of you pretty much just color, but we also have roughness, uh, metallic, uh, bump or normal. That's all coming out of there. Those are separate PGs that essentially get put onto a um, material in the game. My main point here is that uh adjusting the rig and the controls and the animation doesn't affect what's happening over here. Okay? As long as during this process you don't go back and change the actual geometry at any point. If you make a change there, you need to send the model back through the the lower path here. Um, that's not as starting from scratch as it sounds. You can reload a mesh into Substance Painter. And Substance Painter actually does a pretty good job of like um I don't even know how this works exactly. It does store the paint strokes in some kind of like um world space thing. uh world space database. And so even if you bring in a mesh with completely different UVs, it does seem to do a decent job of like reapplying the paint strokes where they were. Uh in terms of the the mesh determined masks, those are easy to fix, right? You can just sort of click on the new mesh and you know, it's just a couple clicks to fix that. Um yeah. So this is the big the big the big picture here, right? And today is about zooming in on this part up here. We can look at a different few different things. Um so keep that in mind, right? We don't need to, and you shouldn't, take the textures out of Substance Painter, put them back into Blender. There's no real reason for that. I mean, we're just going to be animating the quoteunquote gray mesh or whatever in here um as a way to sort of get uh that back into Unity over here, right? Because everything ends up over here, right? So, this is different from some of the other animated things we've done where we animated we didn't animate in Blender, right? So, this part up here is going to be taking place in Blender. We'll look at some Miximo possibly depending on your character design. Um, but for animating a character, it makes more sense to do it in Blender. Um, there's bless you.

The problem is it's one continuous mesh and so we can't move the arm by just changing and animating the transform properties. This is fairly obvious. And so we need to um add bones to it.

That's totally different vertices. um and it doesn't get applied to you can sort of weight the application of this transform meaning that when I move this thing this vertex moves along 100% as if it were totally parented to it or you can make it less than 100% and so that when the object when the bone moves it moves a little bit it moves 50% as much or 25% % as much or whatever it is.

And if this is your first time out here, seems like, yeah, mission accomplished. Let's call it a day here. Um, the problem is at this point that depending on the complexity of your character, the bones, animating the individual bones ends up being not a great construct for doing the animation. Right?

And so there's this additional level of abstraction there, right? And so that level of abstraction is essentially the controls. So a level of abstraction above the bones that then the controls are animated and then the controls control the bones and the bones control the vertices.

And in Blender, that essentially is going to be parenting. And we can automatically assign these with automatic weights. And so Blender refers to it as parenting with automatic weights. And so if you click shiftclick, control P, we get this more complex um parenting submen. And we're going to do this one for now. Now, uh looks like the mesh went away. did not go away. It's just merely now a child of the armature. And so this is the first sign that you've done it correctly is that uh the mesh is a child of the armature and not the other way around. The other way around is not don't do that. Control Z and step back. And so now if I uh select the armature and then I go into pose mode. Remember you can't go into pose mode unless you have the armature selected in object mode first. So that ends up being a pain point later on. Now if I were to do this and rotate these things, um you see that the bones now have influence over the mesh uh in the way that you would expect. But we can look at some of the issues here with this in that I made a super simple mesh in this mesh here. I would say is at the for most instances here. This is going to be too few um vertices in order to in order to work when you're in Blender by yourself or I mean if you're in Blender and you weren't going to be doing um if you're just staying in Blender and just animating here and you weren't worried about Unity or games or any of this business. Uh, one possible solution here would be to uh add a subdivision surface after the armature and then here now it does some subdividing um after I move things around here, but Um yeah, this is one possible solution. Why is this why can't we just do this in Unity? Um because this means we would need to run the subd every frame and when you're rendering an animation in Blender, you know, it's you if you didn't have a thousand of these objects, it wouldn't be a huge amount of time. not enough not enough time to move a render, right? Uh in a way really appreciable amount of time, right? Think about how we talk about time for rendering, right? How many seconds did it take to render this frame, right? And for all of our projects, you want to be under a minute, right? so that you're not becoming a a render wrangler, a render farm manager, right? Um, but when we talk about games, the metric is inverted, right? It's frames per second. And so the subd even though it might be adding fractions of a second to your blender render which is just kind of negligible given our um scale but when you're talking about the game right you've got to render at least 30 frames a second and so this ends up being not not a good strategy and so you don't want to be subdividing afterwards. In fact, you know, there's there's a reason there's no, you know, subdivision surface component in Unity that's readily available by default, right? They're sort of saving you from yourself there because they know you shouldn't be running that algorithm every frame. Okay. So, if we come back now to before we parented this and we want a more desirable result, we would subdivide. Now, right again, you're by this point, you should already like that's why we spent a lot of time talking about Q Rehashify and remshing and density last week, right? so that we so that everyone felt good about the density of their models and that was going to work not only for painting and UV unwrapping but also for um rigging.",
    "transcript_segment": "to. So this process, Blender doesn't use this phrase very much, but this is the one to bind the bones to the mesh. And in Blender, that essentially is going to be parenting. And we can automatically assign these with automatic weights. And so Blender refers to it as parenting with automatic weights. And so if you click shiftclick, control P, we get this more complex um parenting submen. And we're going to do this one for now. Now, uh looks like the mesh went away. did not go away. It's just merely now a child of the armature. And so this is the first sign that you've done it correctly is that uh the mesh is a child of the armature and not the other way around. The other way around is not don't do that. Control Z and step back. And so now if I uh select the armature and then I go into pose mode. Remember you can't go into pose mode unless you have the armature selected in object mode first. So that ends up being a pain point later on. Now if I were to do this and rotate these things, um you see that the bones now have influence over the mesh uh in the way that you would expect. But we can look at some of the issues here with this in that I made a super simple mesh in this mesh here. I would say is at the for most instances here. This is going to be too few um vertices in order to in order to work when you're in Blender by yourself or I mean if you're in Blender and you weren't going to be doing um if you're just staying in Blender and just animating here and you weren't worried about Unity or games or any of this business. Uh, one possible solution here would be to uh add a subdivision surface after the armature and then here now it does some subdividing um after I move things around here, but Um yeah, this is one possible solution. Why is this why can't we just do this in Unity? Um because this means we would need to run the subd every frame and when you're rendering an animation in Blender, you know, it's you if you didn't have a thousand of these objects, it wouldn't be a huge amount of time. not enough not enough time to move a render, right?

And so if you were to select different bones here on let's keep this on this on and this Yeah. Okay. So, we get to see exactly what's happening with everything. The other thing we want to make sure we have on here is our normalization for when we're painting. So, uh, each bone has influence. This is a percentage. And the basic idea here is that once you start getting in here and adjusting this kind of thing, you can end up a situation where you have more than 100%. This is undesirable, creates a bunch of um of issues. And so normalizing here uh sort of saves you from yourself in that it um if things do get painted so that you've signed more than a total of 100% it you know smooshes it back down to 100% so you don't end up in that situation. So the normalize all here is going to be important especially once we're done to move some stuff around. So, for instance, with our stuff up here up at the top, let's look at the leg, right? And so, we want um to get rid of some of the legs influence up here. And we have one is means that we want to increase the influence and zero would be decrease the influence. So, if I put it up at one and paint, I'm painting red in here, meaning I'm giving the this leg bone more control, right? This left leg more control over this. If I move it down to zero and start painting, I'm erasing this. F um makes the brush bigger, just like our sculpting brush controls. So, that's useful. Um, and that allows us to, you know, get rid of some of this. We don't want this up here or over here. And then we'll look at the leg again and see how that's working. You got to get this um set before doing any of the animation. Just like you need to get the UV set before you start um before you start dealing with the uh painting in this case. And so once we would adjust this then um we can run our let's see here normalize All let's go back and see how the left leg is that the left leg. Yeah, the left leg compares to the other one now. So, if we go back to object mode, back to the armature, back to edit mode, and then look at our legs. Pose mode is what I meant to say. So better miss some parts up there. But this compared to this Although it looks like this one got adjusted a little bit as well, which is strange, unless I had the symmetry on while I was painting, which I don't think I did, but I'd have to look. We come back here. Let's look at the other leg. We have our right leg. We're in way paint mode. Now it's not painting at all. Does anybody else see anything? This looks copathetic to me. I don't sure why we're not painting. None of those are logged. That all looks good. That looks right. I'm going to try and reopen it. Let's save incremental Okay, now I'm back. >> All right, let's I mean, I hope I run into that again. I hope it doesn't work again, but I'm not sure why that was not working before because now we seem fine. Okay. So, the other thing to draw your attention to here is the uh blur. So, if I'm just trying to eliminate some of this, I'm going to do that. Trying to get the leg not to move the body as much. Like so. I'm going to uh normalize all. And the other thing is the blur brush here, which can help to sort of like smooth out some of this once you've sort of, you know, grossly applied this one. Right? A lot of times when doing this, it's either at zero like eliminated or it's one add it. and then grabbing the blur brush and just sort of like smoothing that out versus trying to now I'm gonna paint it at 0 75 or now I'm gonna paint it at 0 255 you know doing that thing. Uh and so now if we come back out uh to here to here to here to here get less of the body moving. If we look over here, we have more of the body moving, right? And so we've got that happening over here. That's good. Good. Good. So, a lot of you have proportions similar to this, right? Um, and so this is again at this point would I go through and make separate controls for all of this? Right? So, some of you may have done rigify before where you make a rig and that's the then you have to use that as the meta rig for another rig where it creates the bones. um it's just a lot. Whereas now you have something that's sort of like directly editable. You know, you know where things are. Let's see if we can just get the if we come back to the mesh here. The other thing I wanted to look at was let's go back to object select and way paint and again symmetrical on the X for the different bones. So again, clean this up over here. Just sort of erasing all this stuff. Having some sort of big brush here helps in not missing those tiny little spots that we talked about before. And then, you know, being too aggressive here, I don't think is bad in this case. Let's try and like make it so it doesn't move the body at all here. blur brush. F sort of smoothing this working just like the sculpting brushes. And then um again normalize all back out to here to here. There we go. Right. So now this is just the leg. If you don't want to have any hip action there over here, the same because we had the that was on. And so now if we look at this one or this one, they both got the same treatment there, right? So symmetric symmetriation is definitely the word of what happened there. We symmetricized the weight painting. But that normalize all is super important. Like as soon as you do anything with the weight painting, just come over here and run normalize all afterwards so that everything gets balanced out there.",
    "transcript_segment": "here by moving this a little bit further down and then reparing in our case. Now, let's go ahead and save incremental again. Come back over here with stubs and uh with the mesh selected now because it's uh if we select the mesh in object mode now uh we get uh vertex paint and weight paint as yet more node modes for our object. And so if I go to weight paint mode, this shows us a little bit of what's going on here in terms of how it has an influence over how each bone has an influence over the mesh. And so if you were to select different bones here on let's keep this on this on and this Yeah. Okay. So, we get to see exactly what's happening with everything. The other thing we want to make sure we have on here is our normalization for when we're painting. So, uh, each bone has influence. This is a percentage. And the basic idea here is that once you start getting in here and adjusting this kind of thing, you can end up a situation where you have more than 100%. This is undesirable, creates a bunch of um of issues. And so normalizing here uh sort of saves you from yourself in that it um if things do get painted so that you've signed more than a total of 100% it you know smooshes it back down to 100% so you don't end up in that situation.

Okay, so the mesh here, let's just double check and make sure we don't have any inverted normals real quick. Okay. And this is all one mesh object. There we go. Um, so let's see how this works. So what's Miximo going to do for us here? One, there's a couple parts of this. Uh, we haven't done this at all in this class, right? Have we miximo? No. Okay. So, um, is Miximo down? No. Okay. Something that doesn't run on AWS. Okay. So, Mixmos is a system. Adobe owns this. So, you log in using your regular Adobe credits and it's a system for combining characters in animations. That's the super simple top level version is that you can take any of these characters, pick one, and then apply any of these animations. It's really great for sort of quickly blocking things out. We've been using it a bunch in 240 to have some characters to build scenes because we're focusing on the scenes and the cinematography. But um so that's one level of it. Okay. The other level is that you can um bring your own mesh in and rig it using Mixmo. And so this is for in terms of like uh it's doing a gonna do two steps for you. It's gonna build the skeleton and then wait the skeleton automatically. Uh and so it'll be do both of those steps. And then at that point you can choose to add animations to it or not and just bring it back as a weighted skeleton at that point. And so that's what we'll look at here, some different versions of this. And so we are going to say upload character and bring in We're going to bring in Landon's example after we, you know, the important part here is that we spent that time last week getting all of this remeshed, right? So, we got bendable geometry for the limbs, relatively evenly spaced topology. Um, over here. There we go. Uh, we'll use our delivery kit thing to export this. So I was doesn't seem to stick on this one for some reason. Um here and we will export that. Right. So you can't I mean I've never done that. I don't think it'll let you just upload a blend file. No. Okay. And so now over Here, I'll drag in the bugle FBX. And Let's get him oriented. And yeah, so this gets boiled down to this will be interesting here to see how this goes with this character. sort of like not quite normal body, but we may have something that saves us a lot of time in terms of the um rigging process, right? And so here, you know, it seems like we're fairly close to having someone use get to this level of automation for using rigify, which would be great, but it's not quite there yet. Um, and so you can say use uh use symmetry. And then over here, um, yeah. So standard skeleton is going to give you five fingers, right? Which is what we don't want. Um, we're going to say no fingers here, just mitten hands for um, our character. And then next. And this can come through in a second.

In fact, you know, like they this one is about blending the animations. We're not worrying about that for Blender. This one is about using the rig. Um, when they named their thing mixo, I was like, \"Wait, have I been mispronouncing Miximo this entire time?\" And then, yeah, but it's not. It's actually that the the Unity thing is mix the Adobe thing is Miximo. And then this person named their thing mixanimo so that none of this shows up correctly on the closed captions when it's trying to figure out what the hell I'm saying here. Um, so this is super useful in a way that we'll see here in a second. And so it makes the mixo stuff more useful over here. Um, let's come back over to here because I think it's probably done at this point. Okay. So, yeah, this got it doesn't expect it, you know, like the whole system is built. If you look at this, there's not, you know, a whole lot of stuff here that's really really strange proportions. It's, you know, there's some big head characters like this very creepy mouse that everyone keeps wanting to use in 240. But, um, it does get us in the door here in terms of like getting a bunch of things set up. And so even if we don't end up using the weight painting, it does set up the entire skeleton for you, which is a significant time saving. And so we can go to next here. Next, and yeah. And so this is the valuable part. Now, we would not want to apply an animation here. We just want to bring it down as is. And so if we download this And then bring this in over here in Blender. You see that we're already at this stage here where there's an armature and the mesh is already parented. And then if we were to grab the armature and go into edit mode, look over here. Right? This has already been established here and all this is in place. If we were to come back here to object mode and look at the mesh and then come in here to weight paint, you can see that we have a lot of weights automatically established here. And so, you know, even in Lynon's case here, I think this saves a significant amount of time in terms of like sort of come in and start to clean up some of this, right? You you probably want the coin to this part to you you to be part of its to be mapped directly to these. Uh, right.

So the the let's try and get this and then once I get it to this point with both of them, let's go ahead and autonormalize. And then come back out. And so now if we're animating from here, that's a lot cleaner than it was. Still more, you know, room to clean things up.

    "transcript_segment": "totally free but you know this person is doing a lot of great work here. In fact, you know, like they this one is about blending the animations. We're not worrying about that for Blender. This one is about using the rig. Um, when they named their thing mixo, I was like, \"Wait, have I been mispronouncing Miximo this entire time?\" And then, yeah, but it's not. It's actually that the the Unity thing is mix the Adobe thing is Miximo. And then this person named their thing mixanimo so that none of this shows up correctly on the closed captions when it's trying to figure out what the hell I'm saying here. Um, so this is super useful in a way that we'll see here in a second. And so it makes the mixo stuff more useful over here. Um, let's come back over to here because I think it's probably done at this point. Okay. So, yeah, this got it doesn't expect it, you know, like the whole system is built. If you look at this, there's not, you know, a whole lot of stuff here that's really really strange proportions. It's, you know, there's some big head characters like this very creepy mouse that everyone keeps wanting to use in 240. But, um, it does get us in the door here in terms of like getting a bunch of things set up. And so even if we don't end up using the weight painting, it does set up the entire skeleton for you, which is a significant time saving. And so we can go to next here. Next, and yeah. And so this is the valuable part. Now, we would not want to apply an animation here. We just want to bring it down as is. And so if we download this And then bring this in over here in Blender. You see that we're already at this stage here where there's an armature and the mesh is already parented. And then if we were to grab the armature and go into edit mode, look over here. Right? This has already been established here and all this is in place. If we were to come back here to object mode and look at the mesh and then come in here to weight paint, you can see that we have a lot of weights automatically established here. And so, you know, even in Lynon's case here, I think this saves a significant amount of time in terms of like sort of come in and start to clean up some of this, right? You you probably want the coin to this part to you you to be part of its to be mapped directly to these. Uh, right. And so a lot of what you would be doing here is coming in and trying to not have this um eat into the body as much there. Probably turn that on.

Not too far, but there go. Um, but now if I grab this and move this, you see it's not doing anything because now this is what's referred to as forward kinematics. Uh, essentially when you do forward uh, kinematics, you animate rotation, right? And so I'm going to rotate this and rotate this then rotate this. Okay. When you do inverse kinematics, you animate mostly position also sometimes rotation if it the rig is set up in the way that the target the thing that you're animating also rotates which is not 100% in every case. Um, in this case I think it was correct. But anyways, now um yeah, we would rotate and then rotate and then rotate and then rotate. Eight. right?

I don't know how much you envisioned those having knees or not when they're animating. I mean, like the Silkon characters have they bend their knees, right? Yeah. Yeah. um even though they're, you know, like their legs are essentially just like lines a lot of times, right? Um so maybe this is the the better workflow there, but you know, the the simplicity of the stub setup can't be overstated here, right? In terms of like you can see how cascading levels of complexity can cause a lot of issues here. But now we've got something where we're able to um especially for humanoidish things do pretty good auto waiting and make any necessary changes here. But like because Razer is I mean like even with the big head, it doesn't seem like the head is eating into the rest of it, which is really nice. Um, the other thing that you where you usually run into trouble is this. And you would see the chest cavity caving in when you would move the arms because this bone here would get mapped to this area a lot. And so we again whatever the mix algorithm has been good for a long time, Adobe has done absolutely nothing to improve on it. Uh, just sort of like maintain it as is. But whatever secret sauce they came up with there on their uh autoeing I still have yet, you know, I would love it if the rigify if the automatic apply weights and we could just do it in-house here in Blender without having going up and down would be great like we just did with the stubs character, but the fact of the matter is that the automatic application of weights there always requires like I've never had anything come out of the process and been like cool, all right, let's go. like it's like, okay, now we're into some weight painting. Um, which when it's simple is not terrible, but when it gets complex is like, you know, no joke. So, um, yeah, the Gumroad plugin in combination. Uh, also notice that the other thing is that I'm using the delivery kit when I export, okay? Because it's um doing the axis conversion stuff. And so, you should do that as well. Don't go to file export because then you're in the world of an additional layer another layer of abstraction in terms of like turning the thing around like is this arrow face the right direction right and you can see I mean we fell down that hole here just working where it was like well I turned it around but then when I export it to turn it around again so wait do we turn around twice or wait are we turn we just turned around half right like that obviously can continue to happen at that point the more um you do there. But yeah, I mean yeah to be able to automatically wait the characters and then one click to get a reasonable rig to start with also really great in terms of actually focusing on animating the characters and designing the characters. Um this class isn't about you know becoming a professional rig developer which is like a much more complex you know ask here in terms of all this stuff but yeah it's just the shoulder scapula part and then in the back here. So this this here this elbow controller right is a thing. Now, if you're going to use IK arms, that uh helps to grabbing this and pressing G allows to sort of, you know, fold the elbow in or out, right? Because with the knee, you know, like our knee is, you know, most of the time going forward unless something's gone horribly wrong. And um, you know, maybe you just need that for some special dance moves or something. But overall, being able to grab these, I mean, laser razor laser razor. Is that Razer's last name? Razor laser. um might benefit from maybe a couple extra edge loops on the legs. And that's but that's an easy enough change. And yeah, I wouldn't worry about adjusting that. I think it's going to be fine. Like it seems to be builting into the rig. Okay. This really looks like a cell phone slapped to the front of his shirt for some reason.

So, you know, the Amy, your yours strikes me as like right on the border here. You might want to try both things in terms of like I mean, you do have like the kind of stick legs. I don't know how much you envisioned those having knees or not when they're animating. I mean, like the Silkon characters have they bend their knees, right? Yeah. Yeah. um even though they're, you know, like their legs are essentially just like lines a lot of times, right? Um so maybe this is the the better workflow there, but you know, the the simplicity of the stub setup can't be overstated here, right? In terms of like you can see how cascading levels of complexity can cause a lot of issues here.

Um, okay. So uh when we have two two characters talking to each other uh there's this uh line of action rule also called the 180 degree rule where uh everyone is sort of implicitly aware of this from watching you know a lifetime of television uh and movies that the camera placement needs to stay on one side of this line uh in order to do a couple things to keep the ey lines of the characters consistent on the screen. And so for instance, when this camera is filming, actor one is on the left side of the screen looking over to the right. And then when this camera is filing, actor two is on the right side of the screen looking over to the left. Um, and if you were to flip or if you were to cross the line at any point and place the camera over here, then the character's um position on the screen, meaning like where they are in the frame would change. it would flip to the other side and the direction that they're looking also would not be consistent. And this is just really disorienting for the most part. And um this is referred to as the 180 degree rule. And uh we'll try and set up a scene like this today. A lot of times, you know, what we'll do here is just sort of set up a typical um, you know, dialogue sort of scene. And so, we'll have a wide shot here where we establish the location and both characters in the space. And then as the characters go back and forth speaking, um, we can have, uh, we can set up multiple cameras. Uh, and usually what we want to have here, what we'll be learning about next week is we'll be framing each one uh, as an OTS shot, which means over the shoulder. And so we're kind of looking over the shoulder of actor two when actor one is uh, speaking. We're looking over the shoulder of actor one when actor two is speaking. We'll also combine uh some camera technique stuff here in that most often uh we're using some sort of shallow depth of field in that the back of the character that we're seeing here is not typically in focus.

And what was the other thing I was thinking about? Oh, uh we'll work in a cutaway shot. Uh so the cutaway shot would be perhaps an opportunity to reestablish uh the line after um a cutaway. So cutaways, we're going to see something that is um not the two actors. So a lot of times this is, you know, whatever it is that they're talking about, right? Um, and at that point you usually you're close or medium closeup to the thing. Like say they're talking about a mug and then we cut to a cutaway shot of the the mug. Um, at that point the mug and its position in space for the most part is not it's not necessary that it be established in the same way that the characters are. And so coming back from that shot of the mug, then it may be an opportunity to either use a different wide shot and then place the line in a different uh location in order to still keep the characters um on the same uh sides of the line. Uh there's a really good Now, this is just the way I don't know 99% of dialogue works. Uh when we're uh talking when we're when there's two characters talking to each other.

Uh, >> guys. >> Oh, yeah. >> It was funny, huh? >> Yeah, it's a like legit funny movie. Um, and again, Mark Wahberg is really good, but you know, is he really acting a whole lot? He seems like a very angry dude from Boston. It's like, I don't know. It doesn't seem like acting. Um but uh yeah, so I mean this one, Dairo and Pacino in the same movie. Um but there's lots of examples of this being broken. A lot of times um when is being done intentionally this is a lot about either establishing some sort of change and power relationship or shift in dynamic between the characters um for this to get uh broken. You know directors are doing it very very very intentionally uh you know like here later in heat or earlier in heat. Um, this is shot of the camera moving and, you know, there's a lot to represent here. You know, Neil's kind of like a hardened criminal and, you know, is like opening himself up to this woman. I can't remember her name in the movie. Um, and so you know, like we animate over to the other side or move the camera, in this case a real camera over the other side of the line and we see that, right?

So, um, this development team has released a bunch of Miximo plugins, and this one is a really good addition in that allows us to generate a rig for a Miximo character to be able to animate them easy peasy. And so, we'll do this a little bit today with some of the shots, uh, going back and forth between the two. So just for a quick demonstration of that, come back over Okay. So, I have the character here just looking for the characters without animation. Um, and so this could be any character from MixMo or, you know, say for instance, uh, LeBron James or Mark Wahlberg. If you uploaded, uh, digital versions of them, you could then have Miximo rig those characters. We'll do Michael Jordan here. And then back here. Um, with the armature selected, the miximo tab over there once you have the add-on added has a create control rig, which is really really great. Um, if we we can choose to have IK arms or IK legs. Um, one or the other. I'll just go with legs at this point. And then it gives me uh controls for the entire character there. And so now um this is something that we could work with when we tab into pose mode. You can grab the individual controls to, you know, at first just pose or animate any of the said characters. the IK legs work. So, we're able to do that. And then here we have the FK arms. And so, we'll be able to rotate any of this. Oops. into position, which is great. Um, super. So, we can use this as we're working with different things throughout the um throughout these shots. So, let's do this. Let's bring in a couple characters here to work with in our scene. Oh, she has no Yeah, that works for Amy. And let's grab somebody else.

    "transcript_segment": "Make sense? And then those of you in 200 are aware of our new tool. Let me show everybody else. So, um, this development team has released a bunch of Miximo plugins, and this one is a really good addition in that allows us to generate a rig for a Miximo character to be able to animate them easy peasy. And so, we'll do this a little bit today with some of the shots, uh, going back and forth between the two. So just for a quick demonstration of that, come back over Okay. So, I have the character here just looking for the characters without animation. Um, and so this could be any character from MixMo or, you know, say for instance, uh, LeBron James or Mark Wahlberg. If you uploaded, uh, digital versions of them, you could then have Miximo rig those characters. We'll do Michael Jordan here. And then back here. Um, with the armature selected, the miximo tab over there once you have the add-on added has a create control rig, which is really really great. Um, if we we can choose to have IK arms or IK legs. Um, one or the other. I'll just go with legs at this point. And then it gives me uh controls for the entire character there. And so now um this is something that we could work with when we tab into pose mode. You can grab the individual controls to, you know, at first just pose or animate any of the said characters. the IK legs work. So, we're able to do that. And then here we have the FK arms. And so, we'll be able to rotate any of this. Oops. into position, which is great. Um, super. So, we can use this as we're working with different things throughout the um throughout these shots. So, let's do this. Let's bring in a couple characters here to work with in our scene. Oh, she has no Yeah, that works for Amy. And let's grab somebody else.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 20, 2025 Camera Animation Setup Okay, that's pretty good for now. Uh, let's add some camera animation to our establishing shot. So, let's come back to establishing. Look through that camera. Come over here to zero. See where we're at here. And add uh some linear animation. Maybe just sort of moving a little, you know, just ever so slightly in this direction. And so this camera here here and just gonna add some position key frames to this. Not moving too much at all. So we'll start here and then zoom in over to about here. And there we go. Let's look at that. So, we're just pushing in ever so slightly. A little bit off to the side. Nothing too dramatic, but we do want to make sure that we get both of these and change it to linear. So that, right? And then we're going to want to cut away before the end of that shot. But we can just move this, you know, at because we switch it to linear now. We can move this to wherever we want. The camera shot would just get slower. But this is pretty good. We can do a little bit of depth of field on this shot. Make sure that we're looking at the Amy's level there. And yeah, just a little bit of softness in the background here. That works. Now, uh, let's check out the other cameras, in particular, Michelle's camera. Right. So, now thinking about now we we're good with where everything is. We got everything blocked out. We got our scene built kind of how we want. I kind of want something over here to be in the background. Oh, is that what the shortcut is for that? Semicolon. Okay. You want a tree that's not going to destroy. Actually, let's not do a tree. There we go. And then some sort of concrete here for the for the ground, something to give us some sense of scale. So with the tiling here, something with some tiles in it. That's not bad, but bigger. And so, let's just make a change of that real quick in the shading. There we go. Cool. And we're going to need some more light here. So, let's bump up our sun and in color. Now, I think that's in a newer version actually. Uh color. Let's make it a little blue for outside daylight. Let's go back and look through our other cameras. So over here, that's definitely better. That's good. Feel like we need more bounce light on Michelle. So, this is the kind of thing in real life cameras, outdoor shots, uh, film shoots that you're not going to usually be able to use a light. And so you'll see something like this, like a reflector that's like taking natural light and bouncing it back, especially onto someone's face. Uh, but we actually can make lights. I just Outdoor bounce is mostly outdoor bouncy houses. Um, and so here we can use a spot for this or actually let's use an area. It'll be softer and more interesting. So the area light I don't think we've directly used area lights right coming from an area rather than the point light which is coming out in all directions from one point or the spotlight which is also for the most part coming out from a single point. The the reason these are the defaults and the first things listed is that they're fast. it's much easier to calculate all the light coming from one point. When you start having light being emitted from a whole area, this becomes more um more difficult to calculate in terms of real world uh or sort of non-realtime environments. This isn't going to massively change our render time. And so, especially just having one here. And so, we want to just have more on Michelle's face, especially without it making seem like this is this other source of light in the scene. Right. So, we're just kind of like filling in And once we have it kind of oriented how we would want. The other thing with the area light here is like where we're doing the um hardness of the shadows with the what is it listed as in the other one with the angle for the area light. If we take this and put it into our lights here, um, this is going to be a result of the actual size of the light. And so, for instance, see if you look at Michelle's shadow here, I've taken the area light and I've shrunken it down to like kind of like a point. And you see how hard the shadow becomes there, well defined. Whereas when I take the area light and start to scale it up, this becomes more and more diffuse. This is why um a lot of our studio lights in comparison to the thing that we're shooting are big, right? In order to get this soft diffuse light in the real world, you need a big light source. And so here here for shooting that kind of thing where we're getting into people sizes, right? We're getting these larger uh diffuse light sources, especially in this, you know, studio lighting environment. Um, and so let's move this back a little bit. Let's look through our Michelle camera and come back to the aerial light and sort of bring this so it's at zero and that definitely gives us more definition on Michelle. If we look at Amy's and the mug mug feels low well lit. I'm okay with the mug. But I had this on. Let me just make sure I am not area. Cool. Okay. So far so good. Michelle for the most part looking other way. This way. Always on the right. Amy looking this way. always on the left. >> Geez, Amy, >> she's looking past the camera. I feel like Michelle's not really listening and neither is Amy in this instance. Let's also clean up there. They have the traditional sweaty miximo look. And let's see if we can >> It's all the lights. >> We only got two lights here. I think so. What? Son And yeah, Michelle has much more roughness information than Amy does. So, I'll put in a ramp here to retain some of that There we go. They look significantly less sweaty. Yeah. I mean, do we need HDR in the scene? Maybe not. You know, like there's not a whole lot of like super reflective stuff. I mean, I guess these windows back here, if we wanted to have more reflection action, but we not we're not really seeing any of the background here. So, I don't know. Let's see. Especially with this being an EV scene. Let's see. I think gives it a little bit more flavor. Sort of brightens things up. Our default here maybe a bit um too much. Let's see here in terms of the clarity of the reflections and what's going on. And so on our panoramic conceptual building, that's the thing there. There we go. And so this is the roughness on the reflection there. The IUR is the strength of the reflection. One is going to be, you know, no distortion a little bit there. And so now if we were to look back and forth between this and this Yeah, I like it. If we come back to here. Beautiful. [Music] slow establishing push in. Almost every time, you know, if students are getting that wrong, it's always just moving the cameras too fast. So, super slow here, but then we come back and forth. This kind of looks like um an opening conversation from Devs. Anybody watch Devs? It was super weird, but fun. I mean, if you're into it, it's like an Amazon or some other um you know, tech company. analog where they're building like some kind of um quantum supercomputer or something, but um things don't go as planned. Uh you know, things kind of get off the Nick, what's his name from the office? um offer. He's the sort of tech u you know a much a much more bearded much more here suit Jeff B Jeff Bezos um in this instance but it was it's it gets out there but it was really good but you know this looking like the Amazon campus there.

Let's look at that. So, we're just pushing in ever so slightly. A little bit off to the side. Nothing too dramatic, but we do want to make sure that we get both of these and change it to linear. So that, right? And then we're going to want to cut away before the end of that shot. But we can just move this, you know, at because we switch it to linear now. We can move this to wherever we want. The camera shot would just get slower. But this is pretty good. We can do a little bit of depth of field on this shot. Make sure that we're looking at the Amy's level there. And yeah, just a little bit of softness in the background here. That works. Now, uh, let's check out the other cameras, in particular, Michelle's camera. Right. So, now thinking about now we we're good with where everything is. We got everything blocked out. We got our scene built kind of how we want. I kind of want something over here to be in the background. Oh, is that what the shortcut is for that? Semicolon. Okay. You want a tree that's not going to destroy. Actually, let's not do a tree. There we go. And then some sort of concrete here for the for the ground, something to give us some sense of scale. So with the tiling here, something with some tiles in it. That's not bad, but bigger. And so, let's just make a change of that real quick in the shading. There we go. Cool. And we're going to need some more light here. So, let's bump up our sun and in color. Now, I think that's in a newer version actually. Uh color. Let's make it a little blue for outside daylight. Let's go back and look through our other cameras. So over here, that's definitely better. That's good. Feel like we need more bounce light on Michelle. So, this is the kind of thing in real life cameras, outdoor shots, uh, film shoots that you're not going to usually be able to use a light. And so you'll see something like this, like a reflector that's like taking natural light and bouncing it back, especially onto someone's face. Uh, but we actually can make lights. I just Outdoor bounce is mostly outdoor bouncy houses. Um, and so here we can use a spot for this or actually let's use an area. It'll be softer and more interesting. So the area light I don't think we've directly used area lights right coming from an area rather than the point light which is coming out in all directions from one point or the spotlight which is also for the most part coming out from a single point. The the reason these are the defaults and the first things listed is that they're fast. it's much easier to calculate all the light coming from one point. When you start having light being emitted from a whole area, this becomes more um more difficult to calculate in terms of real world uh or sort of non-realtime environments. This isn't going to massively change our render time. And so, especially just having one here. And so, we want to just have more on Michelle's face, especially without it making seem like this is this other source of light in the scene. Right. So, we're just kind of like filling in And once we have it kind of oriented how we would want. The other thing with the area light here is like where we're doing the um hardness of the shadows with the what is it listed as in the other one with the angle for the area light. If we take this and put it into our lights here, um, this is going to be a result of the actual size of the light. And so, for instance, see if you look at Michelle's shadow here, I've taken the area light and I've shrunken it down to like kind of like a point. And you see how hard the shadow becomes there, well defined. Whereas when I take the area light and start to scale it up, this becomes more and more diffuse. This is why um a lot of our studio lights in comparison to the thing that we're shooting are big, right? In order to get this soft diffuse light in the real world, you need a big light source. And so here here for shooting that kind of thing where we're getting into people sizes, right? We're getting these larger uh diffuse light sources, especially in this, you know, studio lighting environment. Um, and so let's move this back a little bit. Let's look through our Michelle camera and come back to the aerial light and sort of bring this so it's at zero and that definitely gives us more definition on Michelle. If we look at Amy's and the mug mug feels low well lit. I'm okay with the mug. But I had this on. Let me just make sure I am not area. Cool. Okay. So far so good. Michelle for the most part looking other way. This way. Always on the right. Amy looking this way. always on the left. >> Geez, Amy, >> she's looking past the camera. I feel like Michelle's not really listening and neither is Amy in this instance. Let's also clean up there. They have the traditional sweaty miximo look. And let's see if we can >> It's all the lights. >> We only got two lights here. I think so. What? Son And yeah, Michelle has much more roughness information than Amy does. So, I'll put in a ramp here to retain some of that There we go. They look significantly less sweaty. Yeah. I mean, do we need HDR in the scene? Maybe not. You know, like there's not a whole lot of like super reflective stuff. I mean, I guess these windows back here, if we wanted to have more reflection action, but we not we're not really seeing any of the background here. So, I don't know. Let's see. Especially with this being an EV scene. Let's see. I think gives it a little bit more flavor. Sort of brightens things up. Our default here maybe a bit um too much. Let's see here in terms of the clarity of the reflections and what's going on. And so on our panoramic conceptual building, that's the thing there. There we go. And so this is the roughness on the reflection there. The IUR is the strength of the reflection. One is going to be, you know, no distortion a little bit there. And so now if we were to look back and forth between this and this Yeah, I like it. If we come back to here. Beautiful. [Music] slow establishing push in. Almost every time, you know, if students are getting that wrong, it's always just moving the cameras too fast. So, super slow here, but then we come back and forth. This kind of looks like um an opening conversation from Devs. Anybody watch Devs? It was super weird, but fun. I mean, if you're into it, it's like an Amazon or some other um you know, tech company. analog where they're building like some kind of um quantum supercomputer or something, but um things don't go as planned. Uh you know, things kind of get off the Nick, what's his name from the office? um offer. He's the sort of tech u you know a much a much more bearded much more here suit Jeff B Jeff Bezos um in this instance but it was it's it gets out there but it was really good but you know this looking like the Amazon campus there. Okay. So far so good. Yeah. Right. We're keeping everything on that side of the line. We're able to go back and forth with this."

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 20, 2025 Marker System and Camera Binding Okay, everybody still get me there on the live stream? All right. So, here's where we defer significantly. Like I said, we can just sort of set all this, you know, how much at once in reference to, you know, in real life, one shot. There's some exceptions to this, right? uh sitcoms, you know, there's a three camera shoot, two camera shoot where set up on a sound stage so that you can have the cameras do this kind of over the shoulder stuff without having the camera the opposite camera in the other camera's shot, right? But those are specific situations. And most of the time on regular film sets, we have especially if we're strapped for cash, which you know, everyone is all the time now. Um, you know, you have one camera, right? So you're not going back and forth. So you do this, you know, one thing and then you switch and then you can cheat things depending on the scene, all that sort of stuff. But here in animation, we could set up the whole thing at once and then just set up all the cameras and go with it. Um, and so here, your animation workflow is that we can have the entire scene if there's not too much going on, right? um the entire scene and then just um each each what is in real life right we'll use more descriptive terms um in production meaning IRL production right they'll They'll have one shot and then they'll edit later the shots together. In virtual production, uh we're going to kind of edit in the scene and be able to switch back and forth between the cameras to again only render what we need. And for a scene like this, this is the preferred way to go. Um, because it's not going to be that the render is not going to be the bottleneck here, right? We should be okay render time. It's going to take, you know, maybe a couple minutes to render this scene. So, um, this in some ways there there's some give and take here, right? This doesn't allow you to be as flexible in the edit because you have you have no flexibility in terms of extending the shots, right? You only rendered what you rendered. You can't interpolate some extra stuff on either end. Versus in real life, the shots have, you know, a part before we cut to it and a part after we cut to it. You know, depending on what happened and when someone yelled cut or when someone ran into the scene or whatever, there might be more or less there. But in what we're for what we're doing here, um, we can kind of get that figured out at this point and then cut back and forth using the cameras. And so uh we will you know sort of edit before the render by um using M which is going to place a marker in the timeline. Then uh control uh B is going to bind a camera to the marker. And this is kind of a really you not maybe not so great work, you know, way of key framing the camera. Um the Cinema 4D system for this was certainly more elegant. You made a stage object, you key frame the stage object. Uh but you know this isn't it's just a couple extra clicks here. Um right so the markers are essentially this other type of camera key frame. Everybody with me here? So uh here at the beginning let me delete the markers I have. Let's look through our establishing shot by clicking on this. Remember, this is the thing you really have to pay attention to in Blender. This kind of subtle gray outline means that this is the active camera here, right? Does that little arrow move too? No. Yeah. So, just that. Um, and so I want to start off with this camera. M. Mouse has to be down here. M. That gives you a marker. CtrlB. There we go. Changes. You know what happened? Because it actually gives you feedback here. It changes the marker name to the camera name. So again, really good idea to um label your cameras for that exact reason. And so here we have our establishing shot as Amy. We were introduced to Amy and Michelle and now we want to cut to uh Amy first and so we will in this case I know I want to be out of the shot before the key frames then right but this does separate them out and so now with the key with the mouse down here M another marker I've switched I'll switch to Amy there we go and then controlB D switches this to Amy OTS, right? And so now I'm here and I can if I play this party's [Music] kind of freaking out there for a second. I'm gonna grab Amy's uh animation and uh slide it over. just want to have just Amy's here. Okay. Yeah, some sort of really fast key frame or something there. That's Oh, um [Music] Why is it not giving me all of Amy's animation? We're done in here. We have her armature selected. We have all of our key frames. There we go. Just simply did not want to grab all of Amy's stuff. Didn't we come across this with something else earlier in terms of selecting the entire hierarchy? >> Just adding noise to the to to grab everything. Okay. >> All right. Let's make sure we're okay over here. Okay. Amy's not freaking out anymore. [Music] Uh, usually the Mixmo things loop pretty seamlessly, but now Michelle's freaking out. So, let's see what's over here. I'm gonna slow down Michelle a little bit. Okay, that's a little bit better. Okay, let's get our timing how we want it first and then go from there. Cool. All right, so we're here. Now we're here. Then we'll come back over to Michelle. So here's Michelle's shot again. Mouse down here. M. And then look to Michelle's camera. Ctrl D. Mouse has to be down here. There we go. Now we're here looking over to Michelle. And then we're going to need a little bit more time here. Let's say 400 frames. There we go. And so we're here. OTS in this direction. OTS in this direction and then we can do our cutaway shot. And so again M and then here and then CtrlB. And so that gives us the mug. And then this type of scene, depending on what it is, you know, would depend on how the scene's going, right? Does someone have a shocking revelation at the end? Um, what could Amy say that's really surprising and safe for class? Sure. I mean, yes. I mean, >> great. I'm I'm excited for her. >> I'm happy. >> I'm happy for her, too. Okay. Um, and so we'll go back to Amy then. Um, with our marker and uh, look through Amy's camera. Control V. There we go. And maybe at this point yeah her for her shocking revelation we'll zoom in on her. And so the some of the stuff you could do like for instance moving making sure that the movement key frames are just beyond the edit right and so this is the kind of thing where this this is the kind of magic the management we need to do in virtual production. Whereas, if I'm gonna extend this shot, I need to make sure that these key frames move further along, right? That's not something you need. It's not a thing in real life. You know, you're just be This is all a separate process in Premiere for editing. Um, but here, like we want to come back to Amy's camera and have it be zoomed in on her for her for reveal. Um, right before we get to Amy's camera, which is here. Here. Let's see. Um, I'm pregnant. >> Someone's definitely going to clip that, huh? What's the time? >> And we'll set a key frame for that. But we'll move the key frame over here. So by the time we cut back, we're zoomed in. Whereas over here, we might need to manage the key frames for this. So here, we're more like that. And this key frame, we don't want it to. Right? Now, it's going to zoom in, right? And so we just if we want to just hold this value, we just grab this one, right click, and interpolation type constant. And so now it'll stay there. And then right before we cut back to Amy's camera, it zooms in and we're there. And then we're back. So for scenes like this, like this workflow is great, right? Um when would this not when would this not be great? If rendering were the bottleneck, right? If this is going to take like two minutes a frame to render for whatever reason, then then I might switch strategies and adopt something that's more like real life production where I'd render out each image sequence with a little bit before and a little bit after in order to have some more flexibility later when editing, right? Um, or if it starts to get if this isn't just, you know, either two characters walking along talking to each other or two characters, you know, some sort of very easy to handle thing here. Um, if we're going to be, you know, kung fu fighting or flipping around or jumping off of buildings and stuff, almost all those kind of instances, it makes a lot of sense to sort of have things separated out a lot more, right? Unless it's going to be something that's um that really works with the scene, right? The idea that everything is one everything that's one scene in the script ends up being one Blender file that's depends on the complexity. If the complexity of the scene is very low, then yeah, that can work out. But if it's, you know, reststaging of the battle of Antidum or something like that and that's one scene, then like that's obviously going to require many many setups and adopting more of a in real life uh production, you know, setting up each thing for itself. Uh also in terms of scope, right, like we ran into this last week where we tried to use the one Blender scene, right? And like that is the whole set for that whole movie. Maybe not the whole set, but it's like a good portion of the set. And like we just certainly didn't have the horsepower to do all that at one point at one time, right? And so so yeah, there's a little bit of give and take there, but for something like this, this works um works fine. And so then I could uh render uh this out.",

Uh here I was messing around with this a little bit this weekend. So here we can the equivalent of like a play blast here in that uh by just sort of crushing this just you know multiplies gives you some sort of fraction of your final um resolution. And this should allow for much faster renders when permitting here. There we go. Maybe it was just that one. Let's see. fairly recently. I've been hitting control S. Blender has seemed less stable this semester than last semester for sure. Has that been everyone else's experience? Is the auto save not working for people? What's that? >> Um, >> yeah, somebody from Switzerland. Yeah. So, let's see here. I mean, our mixmo characters haven't traditionally been super difficult here in terms of rendering. And so, what if we just took some things off the table here? Is it these buildings? Yes. All right. So now Okay. Okay. So, here I'm going to give you guys some really good professional advice. This um this thing that's uh quadrupling the render time that's only in the background of one shot. I'm going to get rid of it. Right. So that's that's some solid decision making there. >> I mean I if I had to guess it would be >> yeah something with the material not the let's see here. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is totally one of those because it doesn't strike me as like a crazy amount of geometry here. Unless like is the internal like is this are there like rooms in this thing? Like is that what's going on? Like the entire inside of it is >> Yeah. So what Blender Kit giveth, Blender Kit taketh away in terms of render time. All right, we can't go inside the building. Yeah, because EV doesn't give us that kind of like transparency in terms of like what is taking a long time, but this definitely was. There we go. And uh There we go. And now if we go back and look through our scene and render. Boom. Yeah. So something either in the shader and perhaps in the amount of geometry. These things are not I mean they're not crazy. It's just the thing with a subd surface on it. But that is much faster even if we come back and go back up to 100% render. Look back through over here and we're to F12 this. There we go. Beautiful. [Music] Yeah. So I suppose Um, and can you tell a difference? If so, delete. Right. So, uh, yeah, I mean, especially with the Blender kit stuff, right? The or I mean, the thing the things we're using to stage a lot of these scenes here, right? Uh, this would matter quite a bit.

    "transcript_segment": "Okay. So, here Amy feels a little bit out of focus. That's better. Cool. Let's save that. Uh here I was messing around with this a little bit this weekend. So here we can the equivalent of like a play blast here in that uh by just sort of crushing this just you know multiplies gives you some sort of fraction of your final um resolution. And this should allow for much faster renders when permitting here. There we go. Maybe it was just that one. Let's see. fairly recently. I've been hitting control S. Blender has seemed less stable this semester than last semester for sure. Has that been everyone else's experience? Is the auto save not working for people? What's that? >> Um, >> yeah, somebody from Switzerland. Yeah. So, let's see here. I mean, our mixmo characters haven't traditionally been super difficult here in terms of rendering. And so, what if we just took some things off the table here? Is it these buildings? Yes. All right. So now Okay. Okay. So, here I'm going to give you guys some really good professional advice. This um this thing that's uh quadrupling the render time that's only in the background of one shot. I'm going to get rid of it. Right. So that's that's some solid decision making there. >> I mean I if I had to guess it would be >> yeah something with the material not the let's see here. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is totally one of those because it doesn't strike me as like a crazy amount of geometry here. Unless like is the internal like is this are there like rooms in this thing? Like is that what's going on? Like the entire inside of it is >> Yeah. So what Blender Kit giveth, Blender Kit taketh away in terms of render time. All right, we can't go inside the building. Yeah, because EV doesn't give us that kind of like transparency in terms of like what is taking a long time, but this definitely was. There we go. And uh There we go. And now if we go back and look through our scene and render. Boom. Yeah. So something either in the shader and perhaps in the amount of geometry. These things are not I mean they're not crazy. It's just the thing with a subd surface on it. But that is much faster even if we come back and go back up to 100% render. Look back through over here and we're to F12 this. There we go. Beautiful. [Music] Yeah. So I suppose Um, and can you tell a difference? If so, delete. Right. So, uh, yeah, I mean, especially with the Blender kit stuff, right? The or I mean, the thing the things we're using to stage a lot of these scenes here, right? Uh, this would matter quite a bit.

In this case, the HDR holds up in the background because it's like primarily out of focus. Just kind of makes it seem like they're at the beach perhaps. Um, and now if we wanted to push the color correction here, you can have curves also per um per color channel, right? And so now, you know, uh, adjusting the amount of red in comparison to the other characters here sort of can give it a different color grading, a different feel for what's going on there. In this case, warming it up just slightly. We can get to some more color correction stuff later, but that's pretty good. Let's say a little bit less. The only annoying thing here is you have to keep pressing F12 to get this back and updated. And our other thing Yeah.

And first, I'm going to start with my Venom Mat render. I made a few changes based on last week feedback. I added a blue effect for the Abson. And then I turn his spider design into an alpha so I can put it also in the back part of him. So this is my video render of him. I really like how the glitter effect came out. And then I didn't use the displacement here. But then since we are like since we are with a space theme I made this where is it? Yeah I made this as map here. I changed the the displacement style to create this well this scen here and also for the fold of the clothes. >> Okay. Yeah, even on the next >> on the edge of the sleeve there. >> This is my space mat. I went for a metallic looking using a metallic look using different fill layers here with I added a smart mask to make the scratches the ros and the dirt there to create like a variation in the surface. I also added some bumpiness to the high channel. And then this time I also remember to apply the the anchor the anchor point which I forgot to do last week. So now we don't see more details on these areas. And this is my favorite level. It's inspired like by the bend structure. I use the mirror modifier to keep it symmetrical which work well for the for this design. Let me show you the UV map. Here's the UV map. I made you have the space for the bevel. And then here the uh here the the smart UV project did a pretty good job since the shape was fairly simple as I didn't use any cylinder or spherical shape for this one specifically. I I did use cylinders I think for the on the other evils. Yeah, the only these little things are this one of them. I think they look pretty well here and here. This is my spaceship concept st. It was honestly the hardest part. Well, I felt it was the hardest part of the assignment since it was my first time designing a spaceship. I went with a mix between an airplane and a ship. I would definitely would like to hear some feedback in terms of the design and then >> Okay. And yeah, so he said he sent me another one here. This is the one.

So this is my video render of him. I really like how the glitter effect came out. And then I didn't use the displacement here. But then since we are like since we are with a space theme I made this where is it? Yeah I made this as map here. I changed the the displacement style to create this well this scen here and also for the fold of the clothes. >> Okay. Yeah, even on the next >> on the edge of the sleeve there. >> This is my space mat. I went for a metallic looking using a metallic look using different fill layers here with I added a smart mask to make the scratches the ros and the dirt there to create like a variation in the surface. I also added some bumpiness to the high channel. And then this time I also remember to apply the the anchor the anchor point which I forgot to do last week. So now we don't see more details on these areas. And this is my favorite level. It's inspired like by the bend structure. I use the mirror modifier to keep it symmetrical which work well for the for this design. Let me show you the UV map. Here's the UV map. I made you have the space for the bevel. And then here the uh here the the smart UV project did a pretty good job since the shape was fairly simple as I didn't use any cylinder or spherical shape for this one specifically. I I did use cylinders I think for the on the other evils. Yeah, the only these little things are this one of them. I think they look pretty well here and here. This is my spaceship concept st. It was honestly the hardest part. Well, I felt it was the hardest part of the assignment since it was my first time designing a spaceship. I went with a mix between an airplane and a ship. I would definitely would like to hear some feedback in terms of the design and then >> Okay. And yeah, so he said he sent me another one here. This is the one. Yeah, this is definitely more compelling than the other one that looked kind of like a plane. So yeah, um"

But for this to be yeah having an inner and outer wall throughout the whole thing because that's not red either back there. So I think you use the solidify modifier.

So I really like that. I really liked all like the little scratches I put on here. I mean, obviously I add stuff like the dirt and all that, which I added displacement to that, too. So that stands out a bit. I liked these like screws poking out. And then I was messing with like the stamp stuff and like the height to get like the indentions and all that for decals. And then this like welding brush I found was actually really cool and it allowed me to like bloat out like certain points. Um so I used that quite a bit. So it's like old maybe like the metal got hot and it started to melt and bubble in certain areas. And then also there was this um like bullet wound thing that I liked because you could it added depth there and it's like if you got hit by like shrapnel or other like space debris. So that's >> Yeah, let's not over use that one. Like anyone who has opened up Substance Painter is immediately puts bullet holes all over whatever it is they're painting.

And then I added more um faces and I subdivided it so I could pull out this bit so it's slightly bigger cuz I was imagining like oh you need a place to put like ammo and stuff. So there's that.

It's either one or the other, right? um the to round because they both round edges and if you have them both on there it's not like you're getting rounder edges you're just creating more in this case unnecessary topology. So let's get rid of the bevel. Let's look at this without the subdurface. Okay. So, it's still two parts. And so for guns or something like that where the barrels of a gun having this internal face here the whole way down I especially for something that's going to be like a smaller greble kind of thing is uh kind of unnecessary. And so I would uh delete that face. Let's look over here. It looks like Yeah, you didn't run it the whole way. If I look at the Oh, okay. Yeah. No, you've got the right idea there. It's not an internal face. You just have that lip there. So, I might give it just a little bit of that. Um, right. So of these sort of like extruded um if you did it directly E Y there we go just a little bit right so that you know unless there's going to be a shot that's like this or something. Um that's plenty and then I think that makes your UV map a little bit easier as well here. So if that's a seam, the whole thing should lay flat. And so if we were to look at all this a U. There we go. Now it's actually laid flat here. And we can gy move it back to where it needs to be. Come over here. and apply this modifier. And then you definitely want to select both of these and join. Then if we look at this, let's grab all of this. And so your seam here, right, especially if this is going to connect, do we really need this bottom part here? In which case, right, because if you're reasonably certain of that, I mean, if push came the shove later on, you could always just sort of fake it by putting another plane there if you for some reason saw this underneath part. But if we delete those now, in terms of where to put the seam for this, you know, I might just I'm going to remove those seams. So if I come in here and clear seams and so now perhaps so this here this is like radically nonplaner, right? And so that's that's part of the reason that you know this is weird distortion there. Trying to think about see what you did. you pulled these up there. And so the better decision, let's flatten that back here, would be to select all of the top faces here and then extrude and scale. And so now we'll extrude up and then scale down. And so now these ones on the there's an edge here on the corner that was not there previously. And so now I can set a seam probably here. And then Ctrl L unwrap those. There we go. It's much flatter. Let's see what's happening here. >> I did. Okay. Yeah, this part probably can be separated out here. So, loop select that mark seam and then here mark seam and then a and a u. There we go. So now that got separated out, we see a much even more even distribution here of what's happening. I mean, this is pretty box-like. And so you could probably even get away with uh selecting all of these, control L, and using a cubic reproduction re u reprojection. So here all control L u cube projection. There we go. And then average island scale and then pack islands. There we go. That's much more proportional and laid out there. So close, but a couple strange decisions there. Yeah, there's not a lot of instances where we're going to use the subdivision surface modifier and the bevel modifier together.

Um, just just very slight, just enough to give it a little bit of extra little bit of edge to it and stuff. And, uh, it it really helped this rebar pop out, which is cool.

All right, here is my space mat. Um I kind of wanted to make him look like like a command pod or something in like a a spaceship or something. Um so, it's got like the visor on it, which kind of makes him look like an astronaut, but it was meant to be like the window at the front of like a a spaceship. I use this I use that same the same rust streaks but I turn them black uh to turn them into like these sort of um like atmosphere streaks that happen when um when it's like burning up going through the atmosphere. And then I have like a bunch of panels here that I use displacement on. And I've got like these I use these nails as like as like screws kind of um to make it look like it's like being held in place by stuff. Same with this vent here. Um, so yeah, I just played around with a lot with the displacement. I thought displacement was super cool. Um, played around with the emission here on the back. Uh, it's supposed to be like the entrance to the spaceship. Um, and then yeah, I've got like caution here, his like model number or something, I don't know. And then this cool little stripe on the top. I tweaked this the the the smart materials on that cuz um it was kind of aggressive, but I think this this looks nicer. just slightly worn. So yeah, that's my spaceman. I have a nice little uh space base here, which is pretty cool. I I like doing that. Um so yeah, we'll take a look at the gribblies now. All right.

I did the um just like auto marking um auto marking the seams on like all of the sharp edges and then I added a couple of my own like on these like middle like on these middle parts to split it up. And yeah, this is the UV. I think the UV map turned out pretty nice. There's there's some bits thrown out about out and about, but I feel like you can you can see where most parts are.

But but you don't have the bevel modifier on there. >> Yeah. Well, I have it like on. >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. I mean, because definitely like these corners here probably should have a bevel on them, but um yeah, that's a super cool design. And that's definitely something modular. You got the part that like holds it on there. So, all super good. Yeah, it's a cool design. And um is this like another wing? Okay. And then like a cockpit area up here. Yeah, we haven't really designed anything like that. I mean, ostensibly the wireframe modifier, you know, on top of some sort of subdivision surface piece gets you a lot of the way there for those types of faces, right? So, And then, you know, if I'm cleaning up these faces back here and then um something like at yeah then yeah I mean maybe applying the subd surface so then you could move some of the points around how you would want uh a little bit more but you know that sort of um that sort of plan there for putting that kind of thing together. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, >> yeah. The I'm not sure how much we'd want to make it look like glass glass because then you'd have to put stuff inside of it, right? So that you would, you know, like and so just just sectioning that part off in the UV so that you could make it just super reflective would probably yeah be the way to go there. That way it's not you don't have to model a bunch of like internal junk. Um, I'm just thinking here with this um we just need a single instance Oh yeah. Yes. Okay. So, um duplicate and turn the other one into a wireframe, right? But, uh let's get the anchor point right on this. So it would be here, here. There we go. Um, now, uh, alt d gives us an instance, right? And so now this is the original. This one is the instance does not show us. So the instance is a smart copy. This is like the prefab in ABC 200, right? So, alt D gives you an instance. Is there no visual indication that this is an instance? It seems bananas. There must be some. Yeah, I mean I must be missing something. I mean I labeled it instance so that I knew which one was which. But um can I tab into this one? Okay. It's just it's like a birectional portal or wormhole. If once it's an instance, if you change any of them, the other one changes. So there is no original. They're just linked duplicates. >> Yeah. I don't know. That seems confusing, but but I guess >> it works. >> Yeah, it works. Um so now but they can't have different they're if you alter the you know object itself it's uh alters both but they can have their own uh modifiers and so if I scale this one up and so on this one I'll in addition to the subdivision surface I'll also apply the uh wireframe and so now I've got um both things the cage plus the other part and then if I tab in and adjust this in any part, right? So if I go to inset and extrude here like so and then tab out, you know, that updates, right? And so yeah, >> I mean yeah, the changes I make in edit go to both mesh objects, right? And so, uh, yeah. And so they can have their each their own individual set of. And so here May what? >> Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Never. Yeah. So, alt alt d gets you in the door there, right? So, instead of shift d and then no matter like the it's a link. Yeah, they're linked birectionally. So, no matter which one you change, the other one changes. So you don't need the concept of original or duplicate because at that point it they're the same. This is like that one ongoing gag in Invincible. You guys watch Invincible? >> There's this there's a you know like cloned super villain who keeps cloning himself but you know like the clone is always convinced that they're the original even though they've been you know one of them has been continuously killed throughout the series. And then there's this continuing um controversy about who who the original is, but it's funny. Okay, well that that solves that issue. Here's Bose.",

Well, I have it like on. >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. I mean, because definitely like these corners here probably should have a bevel on them, but um yeah, that's a super cool design. And that's definitely something modular. You got the part that like holds it on there. So, all super good. Yeah, it's a cool design. And um is this like another wing? Okay. And then like a cockpit area up here. Yeah, we haven't really designed anything like that. I mean, ostensibly the wireframe modifier, you know, on top of some sort of subdivision surface piece gets you a lot of the way there for those types of faces, right? So, And then, you know, if I'm cleaning up these faces back here and then um something like at yeah then yeah I mean maybe applying the subd surface so then you could move some of the points around how you would want uh a little bit more but you know that sort of um that sort of plan there for putting that kind of thing together. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, >> yeah. The I'm not sure how much we'd want to make it look like glass glass because then you'd have to put stuff inside of it, right? So that you would, you know, like and so just just sectioning that part off in the UV so that you could make it just super reflective would probably yeah be the way to go there. That way it's not you don't have to model a bunch of like internal junk. Um, I'm just thinking here with this um we just need a single instance Oh yeah. Yes. Okay. So, um duplicate and turn the other one into a wireframe, right? But, uh let's get the anchor point right on this. So it would be here, here. There we go. Um, now, uh, alt d gives us an instance, right? And so now this is the original. This one is the instance does not show us. So the instance is a smart copy. This is like the prefab in ABC 200, right? So, alt D gives you an instance. Is there no visual indication that this is an instance? It seems bananas. There must be some. Yeah, I mean I must be missing something. I mean I labeled it instance so that I knew which one was which. But um can I tab into this one? Okay. It's just it's like a birectional portal or wormhole. If once it's an instance, if you change any of them, the other one changes. So there is no original. They're just linked duplicates. >> Yeah. I don't know. That seems confusing, but but I guess >> it works. >> Yeah, it works. Um so now but they can't have different they're if you alter the you know object itself it's uh alters both but they can have their own uh modifiers and so if I scale this one up and so on this one I'll in addition to the subdivision surface I'll also apply the uh wireframe and so now I've got um both things the cage plus the other part and then if I tab in and adjust this in any part, right? So if I go to inset and extrude here like so and then tab out, you know, that updates, right? And so yeah, >> I mean yeah, the changes I make in edit go to both mesh objects, right? And so, uh, yeah. And so they can have their each their own individual set of. And so here May what? >> Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Never. Yeah. So, alt alt d gets you in the door there, right? So, instead of shift d and then no matter like the it's a link. Yeah, they're linked birectionally. So, no matter which one you change, the other one changes. So you don't need the concept of original or duplicate because at that point it they're the same. This is like that one ongoing gag in Invincible. You guys watch Invincible? >> There's this there's a you know like cloned super villain who keeps cloning himself but you know like the clone is always convinced that they're the original even though they've been you know one of them has been continuously killed throughout the series. And then there's this continuing um controversy about who who the original is, but it's funny. Okay, well that that solves that issue. Here's Bose."

This is my little spaceman right here. Gave him glass visor. Pretty cool helm. Tried to try to keep it simple. Not too much craziness going on. Some decals. These ones. It was two different decals that I erased and made look together. I gave him an O2 tank, but I had some weird like clipping with the displacement and the height. So, I asked this in Discord, but nobody got back to me on it. I have displacement and height on like the base of the suit because I wanted to make some of the arms puffy and like the other ones not, but the only thing I mean, I could have put two masks on it with the same thing, but the displacement slider does absolutely nothing in the >> Yeah, the the displacement the only displacement we've been doing is >> Right. Right. which reads the height channel. So yeah, this channel isn't going anywhere. >> No, it it's it's it No, you can make the the the missing link link here is that um in Substance Painter there are different shaders. We've kind of just totally ignored this up until now. But if you click right here, there's different shading models. And so this is like switching out the very last node in the Blender shader node interface, right? The the mo the in Blender it's the BSDF shader, right? And as we've seen up until now, you can switch that out and there's the different shaders have different inputs, right? And so it's the same case here with some of these have different inputs. And so um just because you added a channel, the channel is only going to show something visually if this shader is set up to read that information. Okay. So yeah, the only you know like the thing we've been doing is just you know changing this slider but this slider is taking the information from the height channel. Okay, not the displacement >> channel. >> No, no, you would need maybe maybe there's a I I only ever use two of the shaders. I think there's some other ones there for some other legacy situations, but this is this is usually This is Blender's default behavior is that you have this height channel that goes into the bump and then you can also opt in to using that to drive displacement as well. So because displacement's always expensive, right? You have to subdivide a lot to displace. And so there's a lot of instances where like if I'm gonna have a really good-looking rock that's really close to the screen, that one gets the displacement checkbox and that way its surface looks actually bumpy, but all the other background rocks in the asteroid belt are just using that information for the bump channel. So they're not generating a ton of extra geometry, right? And so that's that's the idea. like like a lot of in many instances you wouldn't want to have a totally separate bunch of information going to the bump and the displacement. There's a few instances where that would matter, but most of the time not. And so Blender is not set up like that by default. And here, yeah, like this it's it's just confusing, right? This is read it's not reading stuff from the displacement channel. is reading stuff from the height channel because that's, you know, that's the thing that, you know, at the at the least we want it doing the bump stuff because that's cheap and fast computationally. And then if we want to look real primo, then we turn on displacement and tessellation. Tessellation is subdivision and so then it takes all that information and makes it even more, you know, amplified there. Um, so yeah, adding the displacement channel here doesn't do anything. The um because you can add a ton of different channels, right? Because the Substance Painter is set up to be is designed to like go out to, you know, a whole bunch of programs. And so you see that there's a whole lot of >> stuff here. And I'm not even totally certain that Substance Painter is even capable of like visualizing much of this stuff, but you could output it as a mask, as a texture that you could then dump into, you know, whatever it is you're doing, like the coat roughness channel on this bespoke Unreal Engine shader that you had someone build or whatever, you know, like something like that. Um, so yeah, I mean I understand what you were thinking there, but that's not not how it works. But it is one of those totally confusing things where like, well, th this word matches that word. That would that would make sense. And that you're you're correct. That does make some level of sense. But like the reason it doesn't do that is because almost all the time you're just grabbing the height information and then making it look cooler >> on it. So you have the global displacement here, but other than that, the only thing you could change is the height. Um, but I was just after not really hearing anything back, I just kind of left it. Uh, but yeah, and then I did the bottom part kind of like space color, like some blacks, blues, uh, dots for the stars. Uh, same thing in the visor almost like reflectiveness. And I wish there was a way to do like the rendering with like starry background because it'd be pretty cool because you could just hide the base and then it just looks like he's floating in space. Um >> uh can you load in HDR here? >> There's a space one. Um, >> oh yeah, override environment map. >> I can't check that box. Why even put it on the screen? Override environment map color space. Oh, that's just color, not the entire map. Environment. might be able to >> I've never done that. Import resources. Can you mark something as I would need to look I mean the thing I do know is like these are in a folder and you even if you can't directly import it, you might be able to dump other images in that folder and have it read them. like a >> kind of workound something like that.

So not too crazy, you know, just just some things made it look, you know, like a spaceman game. an O2 tank oxygen labeled it. >> Oh, I mean the main thing is that you could uh render a PNG with an alpha channel and then composite it, you know, in Photoshop or After Effects or wherever. >> Um, Blender >> did a bunch of different layers. I have some just basic layers, then some fill layers. Uh, like for the emblem, I did fill layers on his helmet for the emblems, both of them. uh stars and the glass film. And then for my beauty render, this Tyranny mat gave him some claws, some spikes, which is also another displacement thing. If you displace one part of it, you can't change over to another one. Like if it's on the layer, it's on the layer. Just the height you could change. Um then here's my spaceship. So this is the Reaver I'm calling it. It kind of looks like a plane, but it's like a spaceship, but and then these are where my gribles will go. So, I have I made an array, an antenna, um, and two other like box types. So, not too bad. And then they'll go like you can make it how Casey was doing in the video uh yesterday. You could size them up scales like different sizes, put them on the wings, little antenna raised, you know, to go pretty much anywhere you want to make it. But this is like the body. I might make it a little slimmer, like cut this much off so it's more sleek and not bulky. But it's a space pirate, so they go around and, you know, just hijack people and steal things. And then for my griel, this is my griel that I made. One of them, one of the box gribles. Uh, let's turn, let's go to layout real quick. So, I used a couple of the hard modifiers making some insets here. Uh, so outlines and then an inset box and just a little kind of like asymmetrical shape there. And then this side cut in. And then on the back side have two little ports there. And then kind of made it look, you know, that would sit on top of something like like overlap on an edge. And that's how the UV map looks. So it did pretty good job. Um, I started out with just a grab uh sharp edges. And I'm not sure why it gave me a seam here and here. And also like how it is here. I'm not sure why I did that when I UV unwrapped it, but it's there cuz there's also a couple here. Um, so I couldn't tell you why. Maybe that was the sharp edges that I grabbed. Um, but I did take those ones off, but yeah, I already put a couple. >> So it selected them and then you went back and unmarked them as seams. Yeah. on the side. >> For whatever reason, when I did the sharp edge, it gave those cuts to them. >> Okay. >> To point Uh >> I'm not sure. >> So yeah, this is good. The the only thing here is maybe on running the pack algorithm. Uh do doing a basic unwrap again so that things are lined up straight and then do another pack with the rotation unchecked. So that you know like this because it's very box-like and you know ideally you would have the box-l like things lined up box-wise in UV space so that when you know the textures are laid out by default they would run parallel to the shape. You could get around this right now by using the tripplaner projection. But um then I mean you can see what we're this here, right? This stairsteppy line. What's the name for this? >> Aliasing, right? And so yeah, anytime you have a diagonal line, if you don't have enough resolution um and you're not doing any anti-aliasing, right, that's I'm, you know, maybe this summer my project is to download ZoomIt, which is the software I use to draw on the screen constantly and uh see if I can use AI to make it an aliased program. But like zoom init is anti is not uh doesn't have any anti-aliasing. So when I zoom in on it, you know, it looks totally Yeah. totally stairsteppy, right? Um and it seems incredible that, you know, Windows doesn't have a tool that's like a little bit more of an elegant screen drawing situation. Um like that that program is like like 15 years old or something. um and and no one has approached it in terms of like ease of use drawing on the screen but and and I have like all the shortcuts memorized so it's really fast but um yeah and so here I mean we're seeing the aliasing just in the in the display of the UV map but then once you would lay textures over top even if you tilted them so they lined up they would the straight line would have aliasing on it as opposed to if if it's lined up with the pixel grid, then it's not going to have any aliasing on the shape. So, so there's that. Um, but again, it totally depends what you're putting on it. Like, if this is going to be some sort of like striped parallel line circuit thing, then it would really matter. If it's going to be some sort of like just splotchy grease spill or something like that, it doesn't, you know, like you're never going to see it, right? And this is all temporary. The the incredible pixel density of the future does not require anti-aliasing. Once all the pixels get small enough that we can't see the stairstepping in every instance like on the screen that screen then then it's no longer no longer necessary. You can draw a stairsteppy line just the stair steps are so small we can't it looks smooth to us. So, you know, it's getting there. All the screens used to be 72 dots per inch, but now a lot of them are more than that. You know, like the the retina iPhone screens was one of the first instances of of that being mainstream where the phone pixel density was closer to paper than what screens were. And so that there's still anti-aliasing, but it looked way way smoother because they're all the dots were way way way closer together. So yeah, in some in some amount of time once all the screens are super super super um you know, high resolution, then uh that'll be fine. But cool. Yeah, I like the design of the ship. That makes sense for me from a like uh you know like like a tractor beam situation here or something like that. Um yeah, and you have a cockpit area here too. And we'll look at some of the other stuff. Cool. Awesome. And do we have anyone else? There it goes. Okay, these are my assignments for the week. Um, >> it's on Discord. >> I know I misspelled beauty. Don't judge me. >> Okay, >> so this is the beauty render for the meat man. And >> is there a setting to have it repro onto the thing or >> I think it's because >> did it look different in the viewport? >> It looked weird. >> Okay. >> So I think it's just an Yeah, super cool.

Um, so I honestly didn't UV unwrap them yet because I was experimenting with something. First of all, I want to see if I can retapologize it to create some better tables. But the thing that I've been experimenting with is this. It took me a while to get it to work. Doesn't work very well unless you know how to get it to work. But so for complicated things like this, so you deform it with uh I'm just going to it's explain it quick otherwise I'm going to be here for ages. But deform it with uh lattice. Then once you've got it to stick on the surface, you use the data transfer modifier for the normal you default. >> Did you shrink wrap the lattice to the mesh? >> Yeah, that was the reason I did that was just to get that. >> Uhhuh. So is there I mean did you do that manually or did you put the shrink wrap modifier on the lattice? >> On the lattice. >> Okay. And is that live or then did you bake that in >> with a rivet or something? >> Yeah. Like a foot around. Yeah. Yeah. Then you just shrink those. >> Oh, okay. >> Uh, I'm just going to it's explain it quick, otherwise I'm going to be here for ages. But deform it with uh lattice. Then once you got it to stick on the surface, you use the data transfer modifier for the cut normal maps which we go into rendered view. Um, it's almost as if it was boolean. So, that's really cool. So, it took a while to get it to work, but I think in the future I'd rather use this for more complicated shapes and booleans cuz the topology and um it's just a bit easier. >> Yeah. So, the advantage then being that you know it's a separate piece that you can slide around the surface however you would want. kind of analogous to like how the stuff in Substance Modeler works where you know you can just slide things around on the surface or not and it just sort of like continuously mushes it together and that so that's happening here but not with the faces with the nor it's like turning the normal angle so that the normal angle of whatever was on one shape matches the normal angle of what was on the other shape. So it looks like it's continuous like that as far as I understand. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. prepared to struggling with pinching all the time. But yeah, that's it for the week. >> Oh, I got your >> two seconds back. >> Okay, >> you see you see those little These long ones. The long ones >> next to the long. >> Oh, okay. Yeah. >> I wanted them to go into the mesh as a boot, >> but I got so much pinching. >> Yeah. I mean the gre grebling you know like the there's a lot of you know the sci-fi design ideally things you want to come from some sort of motivated place where you're not just throwing a lot of extra junk on things for just absolutely no reason. But, you know, there's probably some balance there in that, you know, some just sort of fun experimentation with it. As long as like the core idea is like relatively motivated and doesn't look like a bunch of just random crap thrown together, then I think you're fine. And in this case, like yeah, the difference between these extruding or, you know, being inset, it's not going to break the break the illusion of the thing. And so, this is your spaceship sketch. >> Yeah. >> Super cool. Yeah. Yeah, I love the asymmetrical like wing on this side and then like spear knife shiv on the other side and some some hanging cables. >> Yeah. >> Cool. That's gonna look great. >> Yeah, it does look very scorpion scorpion like. And is that everybody?",

And uh if we were to apply the bevel modifier, I mean can sort of see you've definitely got a couple really close edges there, but um now if we were to export this, we'd have something that works there. Cool. Okay. Um, okay. The wing, right? That's more of the shape of it, not necessarily like something that goes on it, you know? So, not exactly grilishish, but we get the idea. Yeah. So, that wasn't in there. This this one, uh, yeah, I think apply scale and make sure you delete the cutters so that you know you don't have this empty geometry that's going to be showing up in your UV map there. That's what I just did to clean up uh the other piece that was there. Uh, so that that worked. Okay, good. Let's look at the other one."

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 15, 2025 Spaceship Export Workflow Setup Okay. So, there's a couple different approaches we could take here. Let's, you know, I think most of you can fall into this category where we want to export the entire ship from Blender to Substance Painter. But we have a couple things we want to take care of here. Uh, ideally, we probably want to move some of the greles around. So I think a good plan here is that each greel has its own material. So that means it'll get its own texture set in substance painter. The main ship has its uh own material and so that means it's um has a separate texture set in Substance Painter. You can adjust the resolution of each texture set independently. So, we can make the ship 4K 4096 x 4096 while the grebles probably, you know, get away with 1024 or maybe even less depending on how how they're scaled there, right? Um and yeah. So let's look at doing it like that. Um, once we get the substance painter, we're definitely going to want to add an emission channel so that we can put, you know, make things put lights on the ship, right? um and on the grebles and that is not a a big deal. That'll be visualized. That's hooked up by default, right? So we don't run into that displacement channel situation. And so we'll see it in Substance Painter. And when we bring the stuff back in, Node Wrangler automatically hooks up the emissive channel to the emission the emissive texture to the emission channel. So it doesn't make the setup any more uh complicated. So that's good. Um yeah, and then in Substance Painter, we can sort of look at um uh a couple different techniques there in terms of the texturing the ship, but I've got the ship there with the bevel on it. Let me see. Is there anything else we need to be thinking about here? Um, the only downside here is that we wouldn't be able to paint a stroke continuously across the ship and the grebles at the same time. Um, but you can uh if you have a texture that is working on the ship, we can sort of encapsulate it as a folder and then apply it in a different texture set. So, so we're good there. Okay. So, let's um test this out. Let's do some house cleaning here first. So, Yeah, let's get through the process here. From a design standpoint, I think I'd probably want some more greles on my ship, but I'm kind of happy with the way it is right now. So, just trying to make sure I got all of the creepable boxes because if I grab them right now and then control J, it um breaks them down. Tab. They all share the same UVs because they're exactly the same there, right? So the the gripples will be painted the same, right? So if I put a light here on this one, it shows up there on all of them. Okay? Now, if you wanted to separate that out, you would join um just one of them. But for right now, let's do that and bring these in so we can just get the workflow. Workflow is going to be a little different than what we did last semester. So, let's just make sure that we're all on the right page there. So, there's that. Um let me get my uh which one is this? This is that um substance uh model agreeable and I put that anywhere else? Nope. Control J. There we go. Um this is that tank gable. Okay J and and the antenna gable >> I'm I'm joining them. >> Yeah. two separate one, >> right? Don't do that. Yeah. No. Uh yeah. The only room here would be going in the other direction. Take, you know, making subsets of the same people. Uh and so let's name these something meaningful. Antenna. Um disc box and tank. Okay, there we go. And then this is the ship. And I think we're good. Let's come back over here. I'm going to move these into Hold down shift. Um, well, they got to go into the collection first. There we go. They may already be in the right collection for you. Then they show up in underneath the ship. Okay. So, uh, we can we we want them as a child so that when it comes time, you know, there probably won't be a lot of key frames on this, right? We're just going to have it kind of like when things are moving in space, it's drifting slowly. If it's moving super fast, it looks dumb. Um, so yeah, sort of slow moving here. There's that.

    "search_text": "AVC185 October 15, 2025 Mesh Map Baking Process good. And so now if we bake the mesh maps yeah um this is which mesh maps you're baking. So in this case all of them. Um and because it's all there we should get the ambient occlusion of where this is close to the hull. That should matter. And so let's go with a default here and see how things fare. Yeah. So it's taking longer because there's separate texture sets. It bakes the mesh map. all the mesh maps for each thing. And yeah, and so you can see, you know, like it already quoteunquote looks better, right? The main thing that makes it look better is that there's ambient occlusion now, right? Uh we have this, you know, shading that's happening here where it gets closer to where the gribles attach, which you know, helps them, you know, especially here, make it look like they're um actually attached. the so since it does take a little bit longer. I mean this is GPU accelerated so if you have a better machine it should go a little bit faster but um the ambient occlusion if we need to change some of it in this case you see a little bit of like noisy junk on the uh main ship ambient occlusion. It'd be great to have some more detail there. So, I'm going to uncheck these and just do the main ship again. What if that were better? And then under the ambient occlusion, there were way more rays. And I'm going to turn down the max oludder distance, which should make this tighter. See how it's very dispersed there? Uh because part of making it look bigger I think is going to be making tightening up this ambient occlusion that's close to the ship there. And so this max oludder distance I brought down and then gave it more rays which should give it a little bit better quality along with like also giving it much more many more pixels. And so bake selected That's definitely somewhat better. less noisy junk here in the image occlusion on the ship. I'm gonna turn this down even a little bit more. That's up. So the anti-aliasing on the mesh maps um one of the ways to solve I think one of the best looking ways to solve aliasing is simply to render twice or four times or 16 times as many pixels and then shrink it down as so it has information about what how to smooth out the stair step. But obviously that's incredibly unefficient. You like you're like literally doing orders of magnitude more computation in order to smooth out the other one. But that's what super sampling is. Like it's doing it twice you like four I believe in this case 4x is like much bigger like four times in both directions. Um we'll just go with that to see if we even notice a difference here. We'll bake that one again. Good. Let's just look at the ambient occlusion by itself. So, pretty smooth here. Some garbage on the beveled corner. >> Yep. >> Uhhuh. >> Looks just like the ammo packet in the game. >> Scorn. >> I don't know. Scorn. >> It's inspired by the art. >> Oh yeah. And if >> I I honestly haven't paid played it, so I'm just told >> based on this being a geeker game, who knows what we're going to get here. shouldn't be doing this image search on the main screen. >> Yeah, I mean this looks like uh >> it's not showing it though, but like it looks like exactly like >> Yeah, they end up being a lot more visceral than my other grie. >> Yeah, you know the after dark gels. Um let's look at the curvature map. The other thing I might do here with the curvature, yeah, let's give the curvature some more rays and radius, especially if there's going to be any sort of edge wear here. I get better results with the maps when there's like more of a gradual gradient along here. And so let's bake this one again. That's a little better. Yeah. So sort of wider there bring this way down and also turn down this angle to see if that cleans any of that up. Let's do it one more time. I mean, these are usable mesh maps. And just see if I can eliminate some of the noise. >> Let me check. Yeah, I have my hard normals on. I'm going to put the segments at two. Let me do one more export. Cool. Let's just look at the curvature once. I want that to be a little bit more pronounced. So, don't recalculate these. Just that one. curvature radius. And you can tell just to do that map again just by only checking that box and then bake. There we go. Cool. Now back to here. back to here and save this.",

So yeah the usually the height is set to kind of stack. And so if you want one to override the other you need to do that. And so on our regular materials here, let's look at this and bring that in. Okay. I'm not sure where that one went. Let's look here. I'm just going to put this one on and move it up the stack. Give it a second. Especially because we're 4096. It's going to Okay. So, yeah. Yeah. Now, this is the issue we run into often is like now things are being mixed together in a way that we don't like. Um, you know, this doesn't even look good on the other sections. Like, let's make it look good. First, let's go to um trip planer and then adjust our tiling and turn the height way down. Now, we don't we want the height on the section I did over here to override that, right? And so if we look at the hype blend mode, by default it's adding it in. If we come over here and change it to replace. Nope. Normal. We're still seeing the other one. I think it is replacing the height. It's just not. Let's just make sure that I'm going to turn off the other stuff for now. Right. So that that's the other thing. The other complicating factor here is that when you bring in the random materials from the community because they're baked sometimes baked down from substance designer the thing we're talking about of the height also driving the displacement is true but then there will be separate height and normal information and so here if I get if I get rid of that we that is working and so if I go to pass through. Okay, so disable shows the one underneath. Pass through just shows this top one, right? And so now, you know, the other height information is here. Ours is here, right? And so pass through or I usually go to replace. I'd have to look and see what the exact difference is between those, but they both usually do the same thing there. Right. So now this information has replaced whatever is happening on the other part of the ship there with this the first time the when you bring the material in, you just got to turn your channels on and off to figure out which which channel do I need to cover up. Is it, you know, the stuff happening on the normal channel or is it happening on the height channel? Okay. And um then you've got to go to that stack and change the blend mode to to to cover it up then. So that's the main situation there. Yeah. And so yeah, we let's get it into Substance Painter and get started painting on these. Yeah, that's a lot of work. You got to make a couple more Substance Modeler Gribbles. bring those in, get those unwrapped, get them all on your ship, get your ship in Substance Painter, and um with the appropriate texture set, and then, you know, we'll get it totally painted and back over to Blender next week.

Um, after last week's class and, you know, hearing what everybody was talking about and how they were doing theirs, I kind of went through over the weekend and like revisited it. I won't go into too much detail cuz of the video. Um, but his name is Morai now. Um, he was a wizard that passed and then somebody botched the resurrection spell, which that's why he's missing his flesh. Um, because that was part of the resurrection that was missed. Um, but here's a front view that I sketched out, you know, real quick. Side view. Um, I used Modeler to make him cuz the way that I wanted to go about it, um, was easier in modeler than it would be in Blender cuz in modeler, um, there's not a lot of tab and, you know, going back and forth and maybe miss something and have to go back and fix it. It's all done right then and there. Um, and then you can join everything just like you can in Blender. Um, I did separate these all out, you know, when I was making them. and I haven't completely joined them. Um, making the pelvis was pretty fun. Um, I I think it actually turned out very well. Um, I brought out a a picture like a reference on my phone and then kind of modeled it through here using um a cylinder of all things and then kind of cut it in half on top and bottom to get the the displacement here. Um, and then just kind of mirrored it and, you know, shaped it out. But I think uh he looks pretty good overall. Um, I did change up his uh clavicles and his uh shoulder blades, you know, made him look more um defined and like, you know, more like a shoulder blade instead of just like an oval like wing. Um, but I did bring him into Blender O. Um, if you go to export and go export full scene, you get to this, which grabs everything in the scene and then you can do all your um computations and everything how Casey showed us. Um, but I did bring him into Blender. So, here he is. Um, made him about the size of the box. A little bit taller. Um, for the poly count, I think I went down to like 6500. So, it's not as dense as a 6,000 60,000. Um, and it's a little bit more manageable. Um, his teeth did get a little mushed and messed up. I already did the modifier, the mirror. Um, but yeah, I think he came out pretty good overall. um messed up teeth kind of add a little bit to his uh like nature of bones, but he still got his fingers um and his toes. So, yeah, it wasn't too bad. But yeah, can't wait to start animating and putting like the actual bones, pun intended, into the body so we can start making them walk around and move. Um >> is it a pun or coincidence in this case? >> So, yeah, I'm looking forward to that. So that's my presentation. So thanks. >> Yeah. Um it's great. I mean did um on Monday we used it as an example there for the skull um fixing uh an issue with the skull when we brought it in. Um and then symmetriying symmetri symmetriizing whatever the word is there. Um >> symmetric of the mesh mesh. Um yeah that looks really good. It's very um cartoony. The things that just stick out here to maybe make some quick adjustments on the proportions on the legs seem a little like the the thigh bone is just a lot longer than the >> when I brought it in the separated. >> Yeah. And then also putting in the um a little bit of bend in the knee uh is going to make things a little bit easier once we get to um uh weighting the mesh to the bones and everything >> and or the bones to the bones in this case. Um and then yeah the the because of the nature of the way the remsh um happens coming out of modeler we lost some of the detail in the teeth. I mean that would be a pretty easy thing to replace there in terms of like >> I was think >> Yeah. So the to keep everything quad- based here to just get a tooth I would do um uh yeah the subdivided cube. So just coming in here and putting a subdivision surface on the cube that's going to round it out. If you put a bevel on first it'll keep it more um >> Yeah. And so this kind of controls how square it would be. And then that's probably especially once you do shade smooth um enough. And then you could sort of get your tooth like proportions and then just uh convert this to mesh. And then you have some teeth that you can place before uh waiting the mesh so that they you know would look more you know have enough resolution there. modifier windows. >> Yeah. Apply modifier is the same as convert to mesh. Yeah. So those two are the same. The one that's categorically different is the one that's in the >> the toolkit, right? because this does some extra stuff. Uh, in terms of the, you know, if you if you run those and then you get results that make it not look like what it looked like before, then that's when you want to use the instant apply modifiers because that's going to convert those real world units so that you don't get any visual change when you apply the modifiers, right? But in this case, um, yeah, unnecessary in that case. So yeah, the only other thing I can think of here is like, you know, perhaps, you know, these will be in the tooth at that or in the skull. And so, you know, maybe you don't need the faces on top. You could just sort of get rid of the top of this, but that's, you know, pretty minor amount of difference. Um, okay, cool. Yeah, you're on the right track there. The bent knees, one one major thing there. And then let's let's look at a few of other things there.

Um, so yeah, this is the concept sketch that I came up with. Made a bit of a pivot on my game. Um, it's still in the submarine and everything, but you know, um, it takes place like in the '60s kind of. And so I'm trying to do this, um, like older ' 60s style, um, sailor uniform like for the Navy. So yeah, that that's why he's got this uh, this hat on and stuff. He's got this little little bandana going on. Uh, these are some of the pictures that I used as um, like inspiration for the character as well. So, uh, really took inspiration from this picture I found. But, uh, yeah, both of these are are like very, you know, like ' 60s, uh, sailor uniforms. So, yeah, uh, that that those are my concept sketches. Yeah, I'm not sure if the proportions are all there. His legs might be too long. So, yeah, this is what I got right now. Um, very simple. And I'm also going for like a PlayStation one style graphics. So, um I'm not sure how much else I will like be adding to this honestly. Like, uh definitely need shoes. That's definitely a thing he needs. But I feel like most everything else is going to be from like texturing. So, yeah. Um and so this is my attempt at kind of remaking that uh collar and the uh the ribbon. Um I'm not sure. I mean, this is kind of like higher kind of high poly. I don't know for like what it is. I don't know. The this camera is going to be from the back. Something like like pretty close over the shoulder. Um, so I'm not sure like Yeah. And so yeah, I'm just trying to get the idea of like a 60s sailor um like a teenager dude who doesn't really know um what he's doing. So this is the full wireframe view. Now, um I think it's pretty low poly. Yeah. Some challenges I faced was definitely just trying to have the right like uh extrusions in the right places um in order to get body parts coming out where they should be. I'm just unsure if I should yeah take it a bit further. I mean, I definitely want to add like something unique or interesting on the back. I don't know if that's going to be in the modeling or in the texturing, but uh just something that's interesting. So when you're playing behind the shoulder like this, it's more interesting back here. Um so I'm not sure what that could be. Oh, I just realized he doesn't have ears. So, um I guess I could add some ears. That's going to be it. Uh thank you for watching and bye. >> Hey, good morning everybody. Um, this is my sketch, my project, the game project >> that this would be in the style of Yeah. Okay. So the this is all lower poly but um still yeah we have enough rounding going around a lot of these characters. Yeah. And at this point, you know, a lot of are texturing in the or a lot of the face is going to be completely in the texture depending on the exact implementation. But yeah, we always remember this this version of Chewbacca. That's the one I think of. I think of Chewbacca. Um, yeah. And so we'll come back. >> Jack with you sent me the blend file for this. >> Yeah. >> Okay, good. Um, yeah. So, you got the right. It has to be in order to be reasonably rigged, it's got to be higher poly than that. Um, so yeah, like the um we can have it be much many more polies than that and not run into any any issues there regardless of what you do stylistically with it. And so, um, yeah, in order for it to read even as that kind of thing, the the limbs themselves need to be rounded, but you did keep everything very quad- based. And so using the subd surface to round out the base of it there, I think should not be too crazy. And then we'll look at another remesh and then um smoothing uh technique there. But we'll use use we'll use yours as an example too. But yeah, that seems good. And so the only thing there is that um right, it's going to be on this still a dark submarine that we're on. >> Yeah. >> Okay. And the character's uniform is going to be the dark navy uniform. And so like seems like maybe there might be some visual contrast issues there. I mean, >> yeah, maybe there's like a white version of that uniform, I believe, as well. >> You know, that might be something to consider there in terms of being able to see the character in the environment depending on how dark said environment is going to be. >> Yeah. So, two things to consider. Um yeah, but good block out there. And then um yeah, the what you did with the kirchief, you know, because that sticks out and affects the silhouette of the character that you know that makes sense there. So, and everything was looked like pretty uh you're pretty specific and controlled and making sure that everything was a quad. And so that makes it much much easier to smooth things out later on using the sub surface. So we'll look at that.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 15, 2025 Student Feedback: Mafia Character >> All right, Mr. Peppermint. >> Hi everybody. So >> how much soundboard are we going to have in this? >> Not a lot in this one. It's more in the other. >> Okay, >> here is my character. This is Mr. Peppermint. We already kind of saw him, but just to quickly explain, he's a mafia guy. Uh his shoes were stolen from him, and that's what you're trying to do. And I know in this in this uh sketch he has his shoes on, but let me show you his fully modeled look. Boom. So, um here he is. Uh I made this in Blender. I decided to go with Blender. Obviously, you can see here he's got his socks. He's he's only wearing his his nice socks. Uh, now if I wanted to, I can turn on his shoes cuz I also modeled his shoes. Um, and I think I'll use the shoes later as a collectible. So, it's nice that I actually modeled that. Um, yeah, here he is. Uh, I followed a lot of that one YouTube video you linked in the um assignment. Uh, that's why this is so colorful. I also did that like he did in his. Uh, so yeah, I used a lot of I would make a cube and then I'd add >> Why is that colorful? What is it showing you? >> I don't know. In the tutorial, he was like, \"Okay, here's how you can make your thing look like this.\" >> Uhhuh. >> Matap, >> these are world space normals, right? And so it's showing us the color is which direction the um things are the faces are pointed in. Okay. And so uh you can see this to some extent here. The um is this going to be world or right? And so the colors equate to this, this, and this, the red, green, and the blue, right? And so that's what that's telling us there. Um, not just, it's not just uh nice colors for the sake of them being nice colors, right? It's the color coding of the direction that the normal, right? And so the normal, you want to envision it as this line that points out 90 degrees from every plane. That's the normal angle. And it's used in, you know, a bunch of the shading calculations in terms of like the the light bouncing off of that face. Which is why, you know, we haven't talked about this much here, but why it's mostly better when quads are planer. meaning that all four points can be connected being passed through a plane or connected on a plane as opposed to having one of them be dramatically unplaner. Right? So just to illustrate this again, here's a plane. This plane is planer since all four points sit on the xy plane. And if I were to grab any of the points and move them, now this plane is non-planer. Right? Now these three points sit on the xy plane and this one does not. And so now what about the normal angle? Not so easy to calculate, right? In fact, we're just sort of negotiating about what how how one would figure such a thing out, right? Uh because now these are not planer. Having a little bit of this is fine and inevitable. Like you the point of this is not that every plane in your mesh should be perfectly planer. It's impossible to make any sort of organic shape that's going to do that. Um the point is that you don't want massively non-planer uh quads usually quads in your project right and so this could be partially fixed. I mean, the easiest fix here is to simply um turn this into two tries there. And now this one has a very distinct clear normal angle and this one has a very distinct normal angle. Right? You can't have a non-planer try. That's not a thing. any three points in space form a a flat triangle that's planer, right? It's when we have four points for quads that this becomes an issue. And the other underlying truth with computer graphics to be aware of here is that um with the when the quads get to the GPU, they all get triangulated before they get rendered. And so, um, this kind of even though we're not doing this, um, for other reasons like the quads will deform, uh, in a way that's more elegant than the tries when we're animating them or deforming them. When it comes time to render them, they all get divided down into these uh, triangles. So, that's what that's showing us, >> the, you know, subdivision surface to it. And I would just do that. And then a lot of it was just scaling along different axes. Like if I wanted to, oh, I need to make uh like if I wanted to make this, oh, I need this needs to be bigger up here, I would do like, oh, do that. Like I did that a lot. That kind of thing. Uh I don't really have like any questions about it. It was kind of an interesting process. Uh, it was a little hard. Some things were harder than others, especially like I there's got to be an easier way to curve this along the face cuz I did this meticulously. I went in and moved it. I'm sure there's a better way. I would love to know. Um, same with like down here with the tie. Um, and also I'm just curious like is this a good amount of vertices for this? cuz when looking at it from the top or side, you can kind of see the different, you can see it's a little, you know, faceted. But if I add that one more up, uh, it looks much nicer. But I'm trying to conserve vertices. So, uh, if it's if if you don't think that's a big deal, I will make it bigger. But I'm just curious. Uh, yeah. And that's that's honestly that's kind of it. I'm really happy with how this is looking, though. Uh, yeah. Uh, I still got to add the, you know, textures and substance painter, but yeah, that's that's pretty much it. >> Cool. And yeah, you did a really good job of communicating socks versus shoes here, like the little wrinkle at the end, you know, even without any textures and everything else works. Um, yeah, this you did a really good job interpreting the shape. It really reads there. Um, the only issue we'll look at here is the arm because this is all one This needs to be subdivided here. And so, uh, the >> I mean, you'll see. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, just the, you know, like just the arm, the bo the bodies and the legs and well, I think the legs. I didn't quite look, but um here. Yeah. Yeah, we just need some more subdivisions because remember a single even once you add the bones, a single face is not going to bend, right? This is a fundamental concept of modeling and then rigging and everything else, right? A single face will not bend, right? And so or BMP, it will do neither of those things. Um, and so in order to create curvature of any kind, you need to have some subdivision happening. And the subdivision surface, you know, if these characters were just staying in Blender, having it all be quads and then deciding later on, even on a per shot basis, how much smoothing we needed for the silhouette. Right? So if you move into a close-up, maybe you crank the silhouette up, the subdivision surface up to three, right? Or something like that. Whereas in a wide shot, this would be fine. In the game, we can't do that in the same way. You know, there's usually not that kind of like levels of detail on uh like the main character of the game, like some of the background elements perhaps. But um yeah, that sort of dynamic subdividing in the same way with the subdivision surface is not there's no subdivision surface modifier in Unity on purpose, right? That's not like a man, it's common in Unity 7, right? Like it's not it's not something you want to have the computer calculating every frame is like continuing to subdivide the mesh. you'd want to have the it's much much much cheaper just to have a denser mesh that's just consistent frame to frame versus recalculating the subdivisions every frame. Cool. Okay, we'll look at the arm thing here and fix that and um get this guy UV unwrapped there. But uh the other So you just moved the points to get the eyes where you wanted them, right? >> Is that what you were saying? Yeah, I tried >> the deform. >> Oh, that one. Yeah. Uh Another option there would be shrink wrap which kind of does exactly what it says. Shrink wrap something to some other shape. And so on this case, the cube going to this sphere. And so you have the shrink wrap is on the cube. The aasosphere will be the target. And so it smooshes it to the surface there. um and the there' be some options here, right? So, it completely collapses this um and so in this case, let's look at some other ideas. What if it wasn't a cube? I go tab in. Scale this down. Bring this up. Let's uh rotate it. There we go. Tab scale. Make sure our origin point is okay. So, same thing, shrink wrap onto the icosphere. Um, so this has it on there. When it's only four points, again, it's one plane, one face, not really bending. It's just each point is kind of being snapped to the surface. Um whereas if we gave it more resolution, it fits the surface more. You could then do something like the solidify. And if this is being calculated afterwards, it comes out of there. There's the offset, which is how close we are to the surface there. Right? So this sort of offsets it. But now if I were to grab this and just sort of g move it, you see it's like along the surface there of the icosphere and then subdivision surface starts to give me, you know, a starting point here, right? in that I would then maybe maybe not subdivide this quite as much, but I have something that's like along the contour of whatever I'd want to have it be on and then uh convert to mesh and you know tweak my points from that point forward, right? But what you did was fine like the that always moving going in and grabbing individual points always always works, right? There's all sorts of other procedural ways to do things, but you have just one in your case, you're probably mirroring it, so you just have one eye to do, right? And so the amount of time it takes to sort of move the points around versus the amount of time it may take to figure out some other procedural workflow doesn't make sense a lot of times, right? Now, if you to make 700 eyes, well, then then it makes, you know, then it's important to try and figure that out, right? But the know you know understanding how the if you understand how the direct manipulation part works then figuring out the procedural part of it is just like well what steps did I go through directly and then is there a tool that kind of does those steps cool awesome looks really cool",

But the know you know understanding how the if you understand how the direct manipulation part works then figuring out the procedural part of it is just like well what steps did I go through directly and then is there a tool that kind of does those steps cool awesome looks really cool"

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 15, 2025 Student Feedback: Pirate Character >> Hi, it's Crimson, and this is my 3D character model for our game. So, for the reference sheet, um, what I did is that I actually found really useful is having it flat like this facing the front for when I was using the front view. And then also I had it again on the side for when I was using the side view. So that way when I locked in that I could actually compare the measurements straight up and it actually helped keep my proportions pretty good on both angles and it made it really convenient to swap between the two. So this is my model. Let me turn off the pictures real quick. Um, so yeah, he I think turned out pretty good. The hardest part was definitely modeling this hat. It looks kind of weird, but I kind of like it. Um, one thing that I struggled with, let me turn one of these back on, that I don't really know how I'm going to do is the crab cloth. So, what I've done to just block it in is I just have two boxes that if I turn off this again, you can see that the inside is hollow to try to emulate like a claw hand, but I'm not really sure how to give it, you know, the little grippy bits. So, there's that. Um, for the hook, I just used a bezier curve and then just converted it to a mesh and attached it to the hook. But I think the proportions look good. I was making sure that um when I was messing with his stuff that when I moved his arm down that his arm stayed like proportional because when I originally made it his arms like when I put them down instead of being out they would like reach past his kneecaps which looks weird. So yeah. And then while I was doing it, I was also checking the UVs and stuff to make sure that it made sense and wasn't completely crazy. So overall, yeah, I think I did a good job translating um my art into the model so far, and I'm excited to start painting it and rigging it. Thank you. >> Cool. >> Hi, it's Crimson, and >> Well, look at the hat there. some terms some ideas here with the claw. There'd be some different ways to do this, but off top of my head, let's look. So, I've got a cube. And then I'll delete this bottom face. And then I'll subdivide it. Um, and move this one this way. And maybe two. We go. And then we can uh apply that. Um, and so we need some we have the general shape here, but we need some more points here to move around to make the parts over here. So, uh, tab and we can alt click here to select the whole way around and fill um, fills it in. But we get a giant engon gone here, meaning way more than four sides. And so when we start doing what the next part is going to be, which is, you know, perhaps moving some of these points to start to create that um irregular part of the claw, you can see like this is the uh non-planer problem amplified quite a bit, right? This is why this is probably the bad part of engones. So in four starting in four five I believe um there's fill and then there's also face grid fill and let's see here I think that should work right and so that um automatically tries to subdivide the fill um but the offset here there we go that's probably what we want um So that that goes how we would want it there. Now this what is it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah. So it's 16. Eight on both sides. And so grid fill works perfect. As long as we have an even number going around, we can make quads out of that all day long. If you have an odd number going around, the grid film may not work at all because then it's not, you know, like we can't do it without having triangles. Then there's the whole like, well, where do we put the triangles and all that sort of business. Um, and so that gives us what we want there. And so now, you know, we could just sort of move some of these points around. I would, you know, first do this with just, you know, the points tool. And so grabbing some of these to move up and start to figure out how to do this. If you need more subdivisions here, K for the knife tool allows you to cut across and then enter to get that. And so you would have some other points that you could use. And then to get the shape more how I would want, I might go over to sculpting mode with just the grab tool. F, you know, to be able to push some of the points around to kind of get the shape how I would want it. Maybe turn up the strength a little bit so this tool works a little bit stronger. and then come back over to here. Um, so shade smooth is going to kind of obliterate that sharp edge. Um, which you could restore again by selecting this loop, alt clicking. Again, the advantage of having quads all around here. Make sure I'm in edge mode and um saying mark sharp. And so now even in shade smooth, we get that sharp edge there. And then um I suppose the easiest we would want to have two separate things here so that the clause could open and close. And so I suppose the next step would be to get the anchor point figured out so that it was where you would want. And then perhaps um you could use the mirror. Well, the mirror is going to keep it in the same object. And so I would probably just Yeah, just copy and paste it. Get out of origin. There we go. and then scale that down a little bit or however. And so there you've got something that's still going to be able to open and close, but kind of has that crab call kind of look to it. Yeah, especially from this distance, that's probably plenty of geometry. So something like that gives us, you know, something that does not need to be remeshed. the original modeling process gives us quads, right? And so this will as we do cleanup examples here once we look at everybody's things um we will be re remshing parts of it in order to achieve more quadbased topology. And so did your original modeling technique result in quads? If so, like most of Gavin's, then you're fine. We don't need to remesh said part, right? But if not, um, you know, like if you had either, let's let's make it twofold actually because like Jack's thing was mostly quads, but they were kind of some of them were much much larger than others and it was just just generally too low poly. So we'll do some reshing there. But did it get quads? And are they sort of evenly spaced? Especially on a character that's going to be deforming, right? For for an object that's just sitting there like a prop, if you have some sort of flat face that's just one face, that's usually fine. As soon as this thing starts to squish or deform in any way, then having equally distributed topology is much more is is necessary in order to bend because with one face, one continuous face will not bend, right? So for super simple things that just sit there, that's fine. But yeah, something like that for the crab claw there. But the design of it looks really good. the hat. Yeah, I think the hat reads as as pirate hat there. Um, yeah. Okay, great.",

I changed the design to be more chibi so that there would be less to model and it would be theoretically easier to animate. >> Is that left over from the pandemic or orate but primarily to simplify? I I took the question of how is this different from Mad Max a little bit to heart. So I'm combining some uh like LED technology with the mask. This is supposed to be an LED mask, so that there's a little bit more technology involved in this world versus the Mad Max, which is just very diesel punk. So, this is a kind of combination of like Mad Max and Cyberpunkesque, leaning a little bit more towards that wasteland effect. Um, so this is the small, this is uh the front profile, and then this is the side. And the here I made two versions. Um this is the high poly. So I sculpted this uh first out first. I started with uh simple polygons uh for each body part and then I sculpted them together. And then this is rettopized using a lot simpler. Uh so then here is the um the polygons for it for that low poly. So if we look in Blender, this is what it looks like. Uh there is going to be a zipper here uh as you saw in my design. There's going to be that little zipper thing, but that's going to be part of the texture. There's no reason for me to model that. And then taking the um advice uh from class on Monday is uh instead of the um having those be individual um polygons, I'm just going to use the the opacity um when I paint it. Um, so that's there, but I didn't u know that for the pants yet. So that's why the pants are like that. So this is the little screen replacing the face. Uh, the little ears. Uh, a lot more detailed here. And I'm going to bake that texture on to this super low poly ear. Um, so uh yeah, this is my character. a little nice little shoulder pad. I'm excited to paint. Um, and I think that is a technical challenge. It kept on Blender kept on crashing a lot and it took a long time to u retapidize everything. Uh, just a lot of accessories which kind of sucked. Um, Yep. So that that is it. Thank you. >> Cool. Um yeah, this looks great. I mean, where do we get to there? Yeah, especially because the head like because you have these funny proportions. Yeah. I mean, the the ear could certainly be denser and because like the the silhouette of it is going to be pretty boxy regardless of what happens with the ear there. But, you know, like this is pretty minor minor detail, right? We're going to be looking at the blinky face light stuff probably, right? Or will we be seeing that in the vehicle? Right. That's still the plan. Or that this is the character that's in a car. >> Gets out of the car. Okay. Yeah. Um, oh, but the car does the car I always envision it as like a Jeep with no roof. Is that what you're envisioning or No. No. Okay. >> Okay. All right. Yeah. I don't know why. Just what I was visualizing. >> Yeah. Yeah. We're going to get there because Yeah. about it seems like most everybody animating the facial texture on is is the way to go here. Um so yeah um that's the only thing you know this strikes me as fine the I mean depending on what you do with the tattered edge here this may look a little bit different but you know I think that works and then that also um the only thing I thought of here was you know if You make this edge tattered. Is there does this face extend in? So there's like a tiny bit of overlap there. So that when you use the alpha channel on this part that there is something below it to see right not not like an entire body below the shirt but just as the arm extend into the sleeve a little bit. >> Yeah. The entire body is mesh separate from >> Okay. So there's like a whole body underneath the Okay. All right. So yeah, you probably don't need the the whole body. You just need the arm to extend a little bit in here. >> Well, I I wanted to make it so that I had a base model. So if I wanted to add NPCs, I could just use that same body and then just change. >> Okay. All right. Um Okay. Well, that solves that problem. But then in the UV unwrapping, you want to make sure that the, you know, the shirt is separate from the other parts, right? That'll make that >> they're separate. >> Yeah. Separate, uh, easier. And then this on the shirt is not doublesided like it's just the front face and then there's a little bit of a side face here. There's not is it doesn't have thickness, right? >> Yeah. >> Yes. meaning no. Okay. Correct. Yes. Yes. Just one face on the shirt, right? Okay. Yeah, that's what you want. Cool. That's a very cool design. Um Yeah. And I can see like sort of blinky face things. I've seen a lot of like cosplay mask kind of stuff like that. I mean that that's what you're saying. Like that's the cyberpunk part is like the LEDs on the face mask. >> Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I've seen seen that on Instagram or something. Okay. Maline.",

Um, so this is the small, this is uh the front profile, and then this is the side. And the here I made two versions. Um this is the high poly. So I sculpted this uh first out first. I started with uh simple polygons uh for each body part and then I sculpted them together. And then this is rettopized using a lot simpler. Uh so then here is the um the polygons for it for that low poly. So if we look in Blender, this is what it looks like. Uh there is going to be a zipper here uh as you saw in my design. There's going to be that little zipper thing, but that's going to be part of the texture. There's no reason for me to model that. And then taking the um advice uh from class on Monday is uh instead of the um having those be individual um polygons, I'm just going to use the the opacity um when I paint it. Um, so that's there, but I didn't u know that for the pants yet. So that's why the pants are like that. So this is the little screen replacing the face. Uh, the little ears. Uh, a lot more detailed here. And I'm going to bake that texture on to this super low poly ear. Um, so uh yeah, this is my character. a little nice little shoulder pad. I'm excited to paint. Um, and I think that is a technical challenge. It kept on Blender kept on crashing a lot and it took a long time to u retapidize everything. Uh, just a lot of accessories which kind of sucked. Um, Yep. So that that is it. Thank you. >> Cool. Um yeah, this looks great. I mean, where do we get to there? Yeah, especially because the head like because you have these funny proportions. Yeah. I mean, the the ear could certainly be denser and because like the the silhouette of it is going to be pretty boxy regardless of what happens with the ear there. But, you know, like this is pretty minor minor detail, right? We're going to be looking at the blinky face light stuff probably, right? Or will we be seeing that in the vehicle? Right. That's still the plan. Or that this is the character that's in a car. >> Gets out of the car. Okay. Yeah. Um, oh, but the car does the car I always envision it as like a Jeep with no roof. Is that what you're envisioning or No. No. Okay. >> Okay. All right. Yeah. I don't know why. Just what I was visualizing. >> Yeah. Yeah. We're going to get there because Yeah. about it seems like most everybody animating the facial texture on is is the way to go here. Um so yeah um that's the only thing you know this strikes me as fine the I mean depending on what you do with the tattered edge here this may look a little bit different but you know I think that works and then that also um the only thing I thought of here was you know if You make this edge tattered. Is there does this face extend in? So there's like a tiny bit of overlap there. So that when you use the alpha channel on this part that there is something below it to see right not not like an entire body below the shirt but just as the arm extend into the sleeve a little bit. >> Yeah. The entire body is mesh separate from >> Okay. So there's like a whole body underneath the Okay. All right. So yeah, you probably don't need the the whole body. You just need the arm to extend a little bit in here. >> Well, I I wanted to make it so that I had a base model. So if I wanted to add NPCs, I could just use that same body and then just change. >> Okay. All right. Um Okay. Well, that solves that problem. But then in the UV unwrapping, you want to make sure that the, you know, the shirt is separate from the other parts, right? That'll make that >> they're separate. >> Yeah. Separate, uh, easier. And then this on the shirt is not doublesided like it's just the front face and then there's a little bit of a side face here. There's not is it doesn't have thickness, right? >> Yeah. >> Yes. meaning no. Okay. Correct. Yes. Yes. Just one face on the shirt, right? Okay. Yeah, that's what you want. Cool. That's a very cool design. Um Yeah. And I can see like sort of blinky face things. I've seen a lot of like cosplay mask kind of stuff like that. I mean that that's what you're saying. Like that's the cyberpunk part is like the LEDs on the face mask. >> Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I've seen seen that on Instagram or something. Okay. Maline."

Um, so right here I have my model sheet for my game protagonist, Harley, who is a rabbit mage. And I wanted to try and make that come across as a bit more clear in this character design cuz I didn't realize that it was a bit ambiguous in the original one. So, I hope it's a bit more clear this time. Um, I did emphasize, of course, their snout here. >> I thought it was like a dog or something. Is that right? Like, I don't remember what. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, I think it reads rabbit now. The nose, I think, helps in the ears perhaps >> to look more like a rabbit snout, if that makes sense. Um, and just overall, I wanted to keep their design pretty simple. I wanted this to feel like a low poly RPG game that you would see like on early like PlayStation or like early Nintendo. My camera just froze there. Sorry. Um so pretty um simple. Um I can't really explain why they don't have arms. It's just a stylistic choice that I thought would be cute and it also kind of makes it look like they're wearing a robe. Kind of like um Hornet from Silkong a bit was a bit of my inspiration with that character choice right there. Um, and then I did add a bit more color to their design because I thought the colors in the original were nice, but I think it was missing something. So, I added that yellow from their eyes to make it pop a bit more. And I did um bring in more purples just to add more contrast. >> Yeah, the lines there are great addition that'll make it definitely easier to visually track this character in the scene. >> Um, and that's about it. not too much different from my original concept, but yeah, again, I did want them to feel like a mage and feel like a rabbit and overall feel like a pretty simple design protagonist. Um, I do plan to have their face become more expressive, if that makes sense, um, later on in the game. So, they won't have those little droopy eyes anymore. I do plan to give them a more confident face later on. So, looking at the actual 3D model, here is Harley. um modeled out. So, I did um give them their snout using sculpting, which I might go in and smooth out a bit because I'm still iffy on if it like is looks the best. I think it's pretty simple for now. And again, this is like a pretty simple 3D model. I didn't want to do anything too crazy um so far. So, like it's just pretty simple blocked out shapes right here. If we look at the X-ray, pretty pretty simple right there. Um, but uh yeah, I do plan to smooth out like the ears right here and kind of make them blend in more with the head and then have like the again like the the I don't really know what that's called, like the brim and like the actual hat and this witch hat um smooth out and like blend into each other a bit more. So, I plan to go in and do that through sculpting hopefully. Um, >> does the other part of the hat have a name? Yeah, I'm not sure. >> But yeah, pretty simple 3D model. Again, I didn't want to do anything too crazy. Um, so that is Harley and that's my character model. So yeah. >> Hi, my name is and this is my >> This looks great. Yours, you know, we definitely need to it's going to need more topology here, right?

And I wanted to try and make that come across as a bit more clear in this character design cuz I didn't realize that it was a bit ambiguous in the original one. So, I hope it's a bit more clear this time. Um, I did emphasize, of course, their snout here. >> I thought it was like a dog or something. Is that right? Like, I don't remember what. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, I think it reads rabbit now. The nose, I think, helps in the ears perhaps >> to look more like a rabbit snout, if that makes sense. Um, and just overall, I wanted to keep their design pretty simple. I wanted this to feel like a low poly RPG game that you would see like on early like PlayStation or like early Nintendo. My camera just froze there. Sorry. Um so pretty um simple. Um I can't really explain why they don't have arms. It's just a stylistic choice that I thought would be cute and it also kind of makes it look like they're wearing a robe. Kind of like um Hornet from Silkong a bit was a bit of my inspiration with that character choice right there. Um, and then I did add a bit more color to their design because I thought the colors in the original were nice, but I think it was missing something. So, I added that yellow from their eyes to make it pop a bit more. And I did um bring in more purples just to add more contrast. >> Yeah, the lines there are great addition that'll make it definitely easier to visually track this character in the scene. >> Um, and that's about it. not too much different from my original concept, but yeah, again, I did want them to feel like a mage and feel like a rabbit and overall feel like a pretty simple design protagonist. Um, I do plan to have their face become more expressive, if that makes sense, um, later on in the game. So, they won't have those little droopy eyes anymore. I do plan to give them a more confident face later on. So, looking at the actual 3D model, here is Harley. um modeled out. So, I did um give them their snout using sculpting, which I might go in and smooth out a bit because I'm still iffy on if it like is looks the best. I think it's pretty simple for now. And again, this is like a pretty simple 3D model. I didn't want to do anything too crazy um so far. So, like it's just pretty simple blocked out shapes right here. If we look at the X-ray, pretty pretty simple right there. Um, but uh yeah, I do plan to smooth out like the ears right here and kind of make them blend in more with the head and then have like the again like the the I don't really know what that's called, like the brim and like the actual hat and this witch hat um smooth out and like blend into each other a bit more. So, I plan to go in and do that through sculpting hopefully. Um, >> does the other part of the hat have a name? Yeah, I'm not sure. >> But yeah, pretty simple 3D model. Again, I didn't want to do anything too crazy. Um, so that is Harley and that's my character model. So yeah. >> Hi, my name is and this is my >> This looks great. Yours, you know, we definitely need to it's going to need more topology here, right? Um again this because this is all one face the body would not be capable of bending which we don't want we which we want we want to bend right so uh so there's that we'll remesh that and Alec"

His eyes are drawn as as simple as simple dots to reunish style which contrast nicely with the mysterious ancient pyramid setting and also keeping the style.

But I might give it fix it or maybe just make it move to the size depending on it will depend on how much time I have when animating animating him. So this was the first time I have created a mo a model sheet for a tree character. So I had to make some adjustments that were in the in my arena design. For example, let me show you here. I tilted his hat. So more of his face will be visible. And then al and then also that cover part of the back of his head which was originally just plain here. So this how the model look like from different angles. Well, the only challenge I found is where with these spikes here. I don't know when I put like sh they look this area looks weird here and also here. But then when I mark the edges, I did this. And I don't like how the separation between the the these two pieces become very visible. Even though like this is all like the same mesh, I just extruded these pipes. And I don't know if we're applying the material. >> Yeah. So, yeah, don't do that. Uh, in terms of marking those sharp, it does look like they're separate there. Yeah, this is a little bit of shading error. We don't really see the um the fastest solution here is that if we can add a another loop closer to this, this will constrain this area that the shading is being the shading compromise is being spread over which will make that closer.

And there is um a trial version and then there's also a $15 threemonth license. And so I use this one at home uh because it's fantastic. Um but the other one here should provide us some good uh should work well. And so for instance, what is quad resher going to do? It's going to remsh stuff into uh quads. So for instance, if I were to do something like this and come in here and grab this and insert and and extrude and then insert inset and then extrude and then there we go. Tab out. And now look at this and come over here to quad measure. Um main things here. So this is not quad measure. This is rem Q remshify. Um, I missed the Q. I can't go back and type that. Um, the save first. This developers done a great job, but for whatever reason, it doesn't have a um, no, you can undo it. It's just that there's no progress bar while it's doing it. And so for quick things, it'll be quick. If you ask it to do a bigger thing, it'll look like it freezes because you're not getting a little progress bar down there. And just, you know, take a deep breath, wait for it, wait for it, then it'll come up. Okay. Um, so save first before that in case, you know, you throw something really big at it and it and then you can go step back to that time. Also, everybody, a public service announcement. Autosave. check your autosave settings and make sure that that's happening. Um the other things here is that we're going to the main um issue here is going to be density, right? We want to many of you have been very good custodians of the quads. In fact, too stingy with your quads, okay? So stingy that it's not going to be something that actually deforms well when we rig it. Okay? So, um, your games are not going to, you know, you're not going to tank the frame rate of your game because there's too many quads in your character. Like, usually we don't, that's not our limiting factor. It's going to be like later when we're designing the game, you come in and you're like, I put 500 lights in this week. And I'm like, that's not a great idea. Um, and that's why your game is going to run at 5 FPS. Um, right? It's not the character that usually is our undoing here, right? or you're like, I added a 100 particle systems this week that all run constantly. Um, I'm like al that's also not great. Uh, so higher um and that's going to be our main thing that we need to decide here with this. So, uh, just as an example of what this does, let's look here. This is our main, um, parameter and let's run it once. and tab in and you can see what happened there, right? Everything has been changed into quad topology, right? And in uh some cases here um that's the density where it was at the default. So I can control- Z back out of this. There we go. Um, and so that was at one. What two look like? And then our main thing here is we do want it to respect these edges. And so I'm going to turn off smoothing and run it again and tab in. And you can see this is like a more usable amount. Um, and yeah, this quad measure is, you know, really, really good. This one is like 95% there. You know, there'll be some things that maybe you have to clean up at some point or, you know, mostly in our case, these things will be fine. Just sort of like not a wonderful distribution across the top here. But in general, the fact that we're able to run the remsh algorithm uh programmatically and then be able to um get grab these, right? And so this because it's all quads, this is something that then when we put it into the subdivision surface, um, especially we have shade smooth on, we're able to really programmatically control the smoothness in a way that makes this very usable. Okay. Uh and so two yeah so this is the distance between quads I think this is the wrong word um right so the density going up means that we have more space in between these right um so that's the tool I turned off the smoothing this angle would also be one of the major ones under the advance Advance. Is there anything here? No. Under the advance, I don't think we need to be investigating that. This developer has done a good job of keeping things up here. And then also, we can tell the remshing to be symmetrical, which is music to our ears, right? So, if we wanted it symmetrical on the X in this case, let's look at this. Let's control Z back again. There we go. Uh, symmetrical on the X. Let's look at three and remsh. There we go. Tab back in. Not for me. Not for me. Right. Right. Uh this is, you know, this is why I'm bullish on Blender in the future. Like do all the major studios use Blender right now? No. But like the speed and increase uh rate of improvement because everyone is contributing constantly to Blender improvements is pretty uh staggering, right? And so that cleans this up. Now we have like, you know, this is really good. Not sure you could do it better, right? Um, and very manageable amount of topology, especially if you were to turn on our shade smooth here. And then, you know, you could programmatically change these things. Okay, so that's the Q remeshify. Okay, I'll put the zip on the assignment, but then also just be aware it will not work this particular add-on the way it's on GitHub. If you grab it from the place I told you to grab it from before, it'll get a blender error. So, you have to grab the release. Okay. Um, is the value proposition obvious here? And what's going on?

Yes. Okay. Good. So, uh, with that in mind, let's look at somebody's shape who's pretty well worked out there, but would benefit from the remeshing. Okay. And so Daener's"

Do I need to remesh different parts of this? Right. No. Right. You went through the pro. You did a lot of that by hand. Yours is fairly quad- based already. Gavin, some parts, right? Like your arm needs to be addressed, but the other parts are good. Um, Daira here. The head the it's mostly quads here. That's fine, right? It has the polar thing at the top of the sphere, but it's okay. And so this needs to be sort of addressed on a piece by piece basis. Um then we're going to need to once you remesh it, it's going to allow for perhaps some more modeling detail. Right? In the case of Daira, she wanted a little bit of bend in the hat, right? And the way she has the hat modeled right now, it will not bend because it's all one face at the top. And so some of you may want to come in and make a change here at that point. Um the other thing to keep in mind is that once we get to there, we are going to need to then make sure that we have it symmetrical. And so before I use the mirror modifier on Monday to do a lot of symmetricization and now we can use the mirror modifier or perhaps some of the remsh with symmetry on to sort of bypass the mirror modifier in some instances, right? Especially if we're remshing, if we need to make one part of this symmetrical, then rem remesh with symmetrical checked on the correct axis will do that for us, right? Um then uh we need to UV unwrap and bring into substance painter.

Okay. um cleanup. That's looking fine. This we want to represent that angle. And so I'm going to go ahead and Okay. I'm not sure why that wasn't there. Probably because I didn't restart or something. Okay. So, here, depending on the scale of your character, say don't smooth there. little dense and we want it to be symmetrical on the X here. So, let's go ahead and run that one more time. Maybe at three. Okay, it's doing world X. We want world Y then. We're repeating over there because the anchor point is off. So, let's fix that. There we go. So now this density similar to that density. That's what we want. Okay. Um these internal faces here kind of unnecessary. So in this case it's still a separate object. So I can slash in and just kind of get rid of this stuff up here. It's gonna, you know, it's not great for the UV um map, but that's kind of minor. Um, having a little bit of overlap in things going inside of each other is fine, but like a ton of it is just not a good route. And there we go. Let's just get the hat together. That's the other thing that's not a reasonable amount of density. Let's see. Is this two parts? Yes. And so I'll grab both of these and control Jesh mesh. There we go. Now they're one. And so they could again is the anchor point good? It is. And so again, this could be run. The visualization of it is a little weird there that we don't see that, but that's pretty good. Maybe a bit pretty good. And it's symmetrical now. which is what we would want. And so now, for instance, um let's get this worked out. We've achieved relatively good quad density over everything, right? Okay, good. Let's manage this character now. So, in here, we need to get everything into uh one object. Back to object mode.

And so now we can make sure the character is completely symmetrical. Why is this hat not get remshed there? No, it's good. just sort of like strange presentation. Let's make sure we're not getting anything weird there. Okay. And so now we can mirror this. And we want to mirror it on the Y. And make sure we bisect on the Y. And there we go. And we are merging. And convert to mesh. Cool. Okay. So, this is our rabbit. I forget the name of the rabbit. Do you guys remember Marley? >> Harley. Charlie. Um, okay. That's good. Now, this is that optional step like there. Now, there's some detail available that was not available before, right? And so if um if we went over to sculpting here, you could do something uh along the lines of why are her workspace is so strange here? Is she coming from the newer version? We're just not seeing the other part. This is even There we go. And so now I can remember grab tool is really our main thing here. And so if I were to bring this up and I might be able to, you know, do something with the hat, you know, if I were to make this smaller, can sort of crease the hat there a little bit. Maybe bend to make this a little bit less completely flat, you know, the brim of the hat, right? So, this depending on how much detail you built in in the other direction uh while you're doing the other part of the modeling, this may be necessary and depending on how pronounced this rabbit snout is. Um, the other one here, just the regular draw, which is here. F control remember pushes in. And so now now the density is high enough that like there's a little bit of work that can be done here. And so, you know, putting some other creases in this robe or whatever that the rabbit is wearing. And let's tab back over here. Okay. So, um, back to object mode.

I'm just going to, as a safety thing here, um, tab in, grab all of this, right click, and say merge vertices, um, by distance to make sure we don't have any sort of on top of each other things. Usually that's so small. The default setting is so small that it's really you shouldn't see much happen there or anything, right? But it should clean up if there's any double vertices anywhere.

And then right click and say or not right click. It doesn't show up in the right click menu to go to face go to mesh normals either recalculate outside should give you the right results all the time.

That's the default subdivisions for the cone. And so, here we go. Your process will be very similar to what I just did. Um, new select [Music] and yeah, we do want to unwrap here under options. Make sure it says recomputee all. I think that's the default now. But again, I've changed things here. I'm not sure what the default is. It used to be the default was generate only missing data which mean that if there were any existing RUVs it would just keep them even if they were terrible or unusable. Right? In this case we do want to recmp compute them because we did not manually unwrap it. So we can say okay and good. Great. We see individual islands over here. There's not one. If you see one big gray box kind of overlapping the other gray boxes, that's not good. That means there's some sort of issue there. Okay, don't proceed. Um, up here we have one material.

Yeah, we can move it to a separate texture set if we want to later. And so we'll do that for now. Uh, good. Okay, that got a little faceted there. Maybe because I pushed those in a bit. Let's look at the it's primarily from the baking. And so if we were to look here without the ambient occlusion. Yeah. And so in yeah I think I was just sort of uh a little bit too fast sculpting there. Adding one level of subdivision on the head so that you can be a little more detailed there. In this case, I think would be totally fine because our other level subdivisions across this are fine.

It also makes the her texturing process a little bit more straightforward in that um applying our different parts with fill layers as our base before we start painting over top of things.

The advantage here is that he was able to much more accurately represent his intended shape, which some people who following the extrusion workflow had more challenges with, right? It's a more nuanced uh situation of pushing more points around, right? Okay. But we need to get all this mushed together and then Yeah, we talked about, you know, not having that nose. Uh, good. Okay. So now in order to uh remsh all of this together as one thing I want to make sure that the this shape stays pretty distinct. It's part of his character design, right? And so let's do parts and then go from there. And so we'll do leg here first, right? And so this leg bend in the knee. Very good. And so this you've already joined this into one object. Do you remember doing that? >> Yeah. >> Okay, good. Um and so here that's all joined together. And so if we were to run the remsh on this, let's see what it gives us as is. Okay, the wrong symmetry there. Um, so it's really respecting the angles and then this is too dense. So maybe before we run this, let's do a little bit more mushing. So we do want smoothing on in this case. No symmetry here, right? The symmetry is going to be duplicating the leg. We want this to be one piece. We do want this to come up into here. And so I'm going to move this up into the leg so that Alt and then a number. >> Um, okay, that's moved up now. And so here, we have smoothing on density. Let's run it one more time. Okay. So with the hard edges, it really respects those as the default. And so let's look at this. So maybe a intermediate step here before we do this or Yeah. And so the built-in remeshing stuff which will mush things together but not quite um not with really great quad topology is the you guessed it remsh modifier, right? Why aren't we just using this? Because um the resulting topology is usually not that great. Okay, so here uh the V voxal size for this is sort of the this is kind of what the density number should be actually be labeled there like as it gets bigger you see it sort of blockifies these things and as it gets smaller we sort of represent that um if we were to tab in here and turn off turn on shade smooth here turn on smooth. Yeah, let's go with the voxal one here. Okay, so we've got this. I'm going to go ahead and convert to mesh. Now, if we look at it, it is all together, right? as we would want for this part, but we want to smooth this out. I'll do this by hand. F, hold down shift and just sort of smooth this out into more of the shape I would want here. Right? And so this is the advantage of blocking out with primitives in this way in that now I have you know essentially you know I'm setting up the block of granite from which then I can chisel down my David or buggle as the case may be and I could also make some changes here to I'm just holding down shift because shift shift gives me the smooth brush. You can also come down here and select the smooth brush if you want. But by remshing with a, you know, that much density, it does give me what I would want there. If I were to look at just this part by itself, the other thing I might do here, um, actually I'm going to leave it as it is. The one as you're running different remesh algorithms, some of them really don't like it when we have non-manifold objects, meaning that there's a hole in it, right? Non-manifold is hole. Manifold is no holes, right? The idea that like if you d you filled up water filled up the mesh with water, would the water leak out from anywhere? If the answer to that is yes, it is non-manifold, right? And so, um, if I were to delete the top of this, like I was just thinking about doing, then it would become non manifold. I'm not going to do that because we're going to run the other remsh algorithm and I want that to not uh get into that. Okay, good. So, we have a much better leg shape now, right? And so let's go ahead and get back over here and come back to object mode and select this and N and here. And now run this. Pretty good, especially when we would shade smooth this. All right. Now we have a um fairly nice quad topology. This might be a touch light. Uh and so I might go down to three and run it again and save before I do that because I'm not a [ __ ] What? >> Most of my life as an adult now is just making the Marge Simpson sound. When people tell me things, I read the news and my kid comes from the school, tells me what's happening there. Makes sense what I did there. See how that is great combination workflow of things. Yes. And so let's do the same over here. Uh so yeah, I'm going to fix this right now. So uh thumb kind of on the other direction. Uh let's come back to layout over here like this. Get uh and G R control. Let's go. And yeah, overlap is easier to fix in the sculpting smooth than big gap, right? And so grabbing uh this Tab, select, move this face. So, we have that versus this big elbow gap there. Like so. But Logan, great job. Landon, great job blocking this out. Um, control J. Now voxil remsh which is the remsh modifier and you can the other you know nice thing here is that this gives you a visual uh you can see the results of And let's apply that. And then let's smooth this arm out. And yeah. Um yeah, just the smooth brush. just using shift here. The having a bigger smooth brush uh in, you know, in terms of the, you know, uh size of the brush versus how zoomed in we are here. And we could even grab parts of this and flatten this hand out if we wanted. And then for instance with the draw brush F down control click and give me a little bit more wrist definition here. Um or you know depending on how much bugle has been hitting the gym. We've got inflate deflate, right? And so how swole does buggle need to get You get the idea. Now that's good. Let's remesh this part. Uh, tab out. Back to layout. Select this over here. And yeah, probably the same settings. Save remesh. Right. Remember when you run the remesh it seems to automatically go back to shade flat so that you can see the results of the of the remshing right um but when you shade smooth especially at this distance that's pretty good okay great um and So now we want to put all of this together. Let's look at this part. Right? So this you really good job representing the shape. Right? But um if we want to have any flexibility in Bogle's main circular body, there needs to be more subdivisions later for later, right? Um, so we can sort of punt on that decision by making sure there's enough subdivisions and then later we could just map all of them to one bone so that they would move together or not if we wanted them to be flexible. So, uh, having the same kind of quad density here would be the better decision at this point. And so with that, let's look at this. our anchor point is in the middle and so we would be uh symmetrical on the Y. And so if we give that a shot here, here, here. Yeah. So that small bevel has a hard time being represented at this density. But let's step back and we do want that sharp angle. And so turn off smoothing here and run it again. See if that does a better job representing that. Nope. Give it some more juice. Let's put it down to two and run it one more time. It's still not giving us what we want. Let's take a different strategy. I might try this. I'm going to grab this front face here and delete it. And then grab this here. Altclick and then use our grid fill. And probably align this with the symmetry of the character like so. Right. And so now I get quads here having some subdivisions. Controllr scroll wheel. Scroll wheel. Click. Click. Right. So, this is manual rettopo, but pretty easy because it's just a cylinder, right? And then you could do the same thing on the back to make sure that we have quads back here. Tab. Uh, select this top face. Get rid of that. Altclick around to grab the, uh, loop here. And then face grid fill. And then again offset to get it lined up with the symmetry of the character. And so there I get my quad mesh by sort of laying everything out nicely. There we go. And let's look at this part. And so here I'm going to do the same thing. So this and this. Uh controll J. There we go. And then let's go smoothing on back to three. and remesh that. No symmetry. There we go. Nice. So, that could be a floppy antenna later or not depending on what we want. Um, and so that great. All right, this is looking pretty good. Now, uh, tab. I'm going to join everything. There we Oh, is just the shade smoothing? No, there's some modifier. I'm going to subdivide that once so it's about the same. We don't need this internal geometry there. That's just going to be a pain for UV and rigging. So, let's see if I can select that face. There we go. Control L. Yeah. Delete all that stuff. There we go. Tab out. Now we should be able to join all this. Control J. There we go. And then we should be able to mirror this perfectly. And then apply this Um, let's make sure actually before I do that, yeah, we are I manually bisected it and so we're mirroring on the X. We are merging. That's good. So now convert to mesh and get our anchor points in order. So here here here there uh control A scale A rotation alt G alt There we go. Alt R. There we go. And great.",
    "transcript_segment": "primitive blockout strategy, right? Where these are separate things. And so this we do need to get it to one. The advantage here is that he was able to much more accurately represent his intended shape, which some people who following the extrusion workflow had more challenges with, right? It's a more nuanced uh situation of pushing more points around, right? Okay. But we need to get all this mushed together and then Yeah, we talked about, you know, not having that nose. Uh, good. Okay. So now in order to uh remsh all of this together as one thing I want to make sure that the this shape stays pretty distinct. It's part of his character design, right? And so let's do parts and then go from there. And so we'll do leg here first, right? And so this leg bend in the knee. Very good. And so this you've already joined this into one object. Do you remember doing that? >> Yeah. >> Okay, good. Um and so here that's all joined together. And so if we were to run the remsh on this, let's see what it gives us as is. Okay, the wrong symmetry there. Um, so it's really respecting the angles and then this is too dense. So maybe before we run this, let's do a little bit more mushing. So we do want smoothing on in this case. No symmetry here, right? The symmetry is going to be duplicating the leg. We want this to be one piece. We do want this to come up into here. And so I'm going to move this up into the leg so that Alt and then a number. >> Um, okay, that's moved up now. And so here, we have smoothing on density. Let's run it one more time. Okay. So with the hard edges, it really respects those as the default. And so let's look at this. So maybe a intermediate step here before we do this or Yeah. And so the built-in remeshing stuff which will mush things together but not quite um not with really great quad topology is the you guessed it remsh modifier, right? Why aren't we just using this? Because um the resulting topology is usually not that great. Okay, so here uh the V voxal size for this is sort of the this is kind of what the density number should be actually be labeled there like as it gets bigger you see it sort of blockifies these things and as it gets smaller we sort of represent that um if we were to tab in here and turn off turn on shade smooth here turn on smooth. Yeah, let's go with the voxal one here. Okay, so we've got this. I'm going to go ahead and convert to mesh. Now, if we look at it, it is all together, right? as we would want for this part, but we want to smooth this out. I'll do this by hand. F, hold down shift and just sort of smooth this out into more of the shape I would want here. Right? And so this is the advantage of blocking out with primitives in this way in that now I have you know essentially you know I'm setting up the block of granite from which then I can chisel down my David or buggle as the case may be and I could also make some changes here to I'm just holding down shift because shift shift gives me the smooth brush. You can also come down here and select the smooth brush if you want. But by remshing with a, you know, that much density, it does give me what I would want there. If I were to look at just this part by itself, the other thing I might do here, um, actually I'm going to leave it as it is. The one as you're running different remesh algorithms, some of them really don't like it when we have non-manifold objects, meaning that there's a hole in it, right? Non-manifold is hole. Manifold is no holes, right? The idea that like if you d you filled up water filled up the mesh with water, would the water leak out from anywhere? If the answer to that is yes, it is non-manifold, right? And so, um, if I were to delete the top of this, like I was just thinking about doing, then it would become non manifold. I'm not going to do that because we're going to run the other remsh algorithm and I want that to not uh get into that. Okay, good. So, we have a much better leg shape now, right? And so let's go ahead and get back over here and come back to object mode and select this and N and here. And now run this. Pretty good, especially when we would shade smooth this. All right. Now we have a um fairly nice quad topology. This might be a touch light. Uh and so I might go down to three and run it again and save before I do that because I'm not a [ __ ] What? >> Most of my life as an adult now is just making the Marge Simpson sound. When people tell me things, I read the news and my kid comes from the school, tells me what's happening there. Makes sense what I did there. See how that is great combination workflow of things. Yes. And so let's do the same over here. Uh so yeah, I'm going to fix this right now. So uh thumb kind of on the other direction. Uh let's come back to layout over here like this. Get uh and G R control. Let's go. And yeah, overlap is easier to fix in the sculpting smooth than big gap, right? And so grabbing uh this Tab, select, move this face. So, we have that versus this big elbow gap there. Like so. But Logan, great job. Landon, great job blocking this out. Um, control J. Now voxil remsh which is the remsh modifier and you can the other you know nice thing here is that this gives you a visual uh you can see the results of And let's apply that. And then let's smooth this arm out. And yeah. Um yeah, just the smooth brush. just using shift here. The having a bigger smooth brush uh in, you know, in terms of the, you know, uh size of the brush versus how zoomed in we are here. And we could even grab parts of this and flatten this hand out if we wanted. And then for instance with the draw brush F down control click and give me a little bit more wrist definition here. Um or you know depending on how much bugle has been hitting the gym. We've got inflate deflate, right? And so how swole does buggle need to get You get the idea. Now that's good. Let's remesh this part. Uh, tab out. Back to layout. Select this over here. And yeah, probably the same settings. Save remesh. Right. Remember when you run the remesh it seems to automatically go back to shade flat so that you can see the results of the of the remshing right um but when you shade smooth especially at this distance that's pretty good okay great um and So now we want to put all of this together.

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 15, 2025 UV Unwrapping Techniques And we can again export this. Name it. Selected objects here. And again, we've been doing pretty well with the Substance Painter unwrap. Let's see how we do here. Here. Zoe, do you have yours with you? You didn't send me the FBI, the the blend. >> Okay. Auto unwrap. Okay, some problems. Okay, this is great. Um, I mean this is not great, but it's a good learning experience, right? Yeah. >> Yeah. And so, uh, this is backface calling. So, we didn't check the normals before we exported it. And if we come over here and look at it, I think we're gonna not like what we see. So this probably is responsible for a lot of what's going on there. So I can grab this again. Ctrl L gives me everything that's connected, right? So control once you merge everything, control L sort of allows you to go back and not merge it once you join things. CRL still lets you select the unconnected meshes. Uh, and so now we can uh mesh normals recalculate. There we go. That's much better. And then tab back out. Okay, that was the only thing. And so, uh, let's export it one more time. And I think that probably messed up the UV unwrapping algorithm, which is why we got certainly what looked like substandard results there. But let's confirm that. And so you can also instead of making a new project, doesn't really matter. You can also go to project configuration and sort of reload or tell it to open a different one. There we go. Auto unwrap. Yes. Recomputee. Okay. Okay. And boom. Why does it want to spew all that stuff? That seems like a lot of stuff. Uh the other thing here, let's check with everything. Um tab a right click um in point mode vertices by distance. Cleaning up any duplicates. That may have also been part of our problem there. And here I'm going to say shade smooth. Messes that up. But then tab and altclick. Shift altclick. Shift altclick. Shift altclick. Right click. Mark. Sharp need to be in edge mode. Mark sharp. There we go. Now tab out. There we go. Shade smooth. Better rounding but still get the definition on the coin part of the face. Okay, one more time. File export X back here. [Applause] We came, we saw we buggled. >> Okay, so it's not the world's most optimal UV unwrapping, but it works. We don't have overlapping uh sections here. And now it makes sense. and a bunch of it is so that merge vertices was the secret sauce here in that there were probably a bunch of faces that were like right on top of each other um even on even when I deleted half of it manually that um just through running the modifiers and stuff like that happen sometimes so that that that's the first you know mesh surgery is no joke right and a lot of times if I really discourage starter people beginning to not try to perform perform this surgery because it's just, you know, like a just a hole you're going to fall into. Um, but merge vertices is the thing that will take care of a lot of the problems usually because that's usually is like there's something tiny that's on top of something else and that causes all sorts of problems. You see how the problems cascaded, right? You can't see it. This is Blender should do a better job of visualizing this and maybe there is a thing to do it. I just haven't found it yet. Um the other programs sometimes do this of when you have these over faces that are like co-planer like this or over top of each other that that's visually obvious because it's always bad. You never really want that. Um and so here um it shows us that. So the other option here right this is okay. The downsides to this without getting it, you know, spending another two hours talking about UV and wrapping is that we have a fairly large amount of space here that's not allocated to any of the mesh. So, you know, that's not optimal, right? But not a deal breaker, right? It just this again will not be the thing that crashes your game frame rate. It's just, you know, not the best. And so, this is fine. The other option would be to unwrap here. Um, and so if you went into the UV editing and came over here and selected all of our um thing here, I would, you know, right click and um, it selects the sharp edges here in edge mode. So you could write you go to select and say select sharp edges. Right click and say mark seam. Um and we could then UV unwrap all of this here. So grabbing all of the faces, right click and say uh UV unwrap. And that really works well for the coin. But then we don't have seams on the other parts. So you could do the automatic stuff on the other parts. So that would look like this. You would grab one section of each of these because they're joined together. Ctrl L. Grab that too. Crl L. Rightclick and then use smart UV project which is going to ignore your seams, make it new make new seams and project those. But we're only doing it on the limbs in the antenna. There it goes. All right. And so now we have a overlapping UVs. This is not good. Uh but we can solve that problem by just simply selecting everything. Right. So we ran two processes that select sharp for the body and then the automatic part for the more organic things. Right? And so now in order to get all of this into the same UV space because we don't want these overlapping. If they're overlapping, that means you can't discriminately assign a specific pixel to that specific face, right? They'll share pixel space, which is not what we want. And so over here, UV pack islands will then pack it into the same space there. In this turn, in this instance, it did a pretty good job in that it put stuff inside some of the holes, which uh doesn't always happen. And so so that works, right? So this I would say that this map is, you know, moderately better than the one that Substance Painter gave us by default there, right? But the one that Substance Painter gave us would work. Okay. Uh and so now when I would export this uh export this and then come over here and then file import new select this one open. Now uncheck this box, right? Because I just did this work. And so turn that off. Discard. Boom. There we go. All right. So now I'm ready to bake the mesh maps. Did that get inverted somehow? That's a strange thing. I'm not going to go back and investigate that right now. But yeah, that's probably inverted donals or something peculiar there. Maybe with the UV space that got duplicated, but overall pretty good. And now we know how to make big biceps on our characters, which is probably a very important thing. Yes. >> How the run the other command first the equalize island size. So I think I downloaded yours. Where is it? went the wrong direction alphabetically. Matt Maline, you also didn't give me the blend file, which I'd love to do the petals. So, just to give it quicker UVs here, if we were to smart project this, which probably won't give us great results over the whole thing, but it does spread it out. Right. And so, what is this? That's this. Right. Right. And so this is undesirable because Alicia knows this, but just for everybody else, this is the tiny zipper and it's getting, you know, like way more pixels. you grabbed that probably has a name. I don't know. Um the and the face which is here. Select control L. Uh yeah, getting less right. And the face is the one that we probably want to have more. So um even if you're doing a more discreet uh bespoke placing of seams, which you should, um we have islands here. And so we want, you know, the number one thing with UVs is that we don't want them to overlap so that we can actually paint each part by itself, right? The next most important thing most of the time is that you want it to be proportional. If it's big here, you want it to be big here because that means it's going to get more pixel space, right? The one one exception to that rule is with the face where sometimes you want it to be even bigger here than it is here proportionally so that you can get more detail on it. Um you can see this if you were to look at any sort of character UV map um that a lot of times I mean sometimes the character's face will have a separate its own texture set but like here right the face of this character is taking up I don't know two-fifths of the UV space when you know like this character's head is not two fifths of its actual, you know, volume or surface space, surface area, right? Does that make sense there? Right? Because we want more detail here and we don't need as much detail on the pants or whatever, right? Um, and so, and you know, like the head is much bigger in this case. So, uh, the command is before you run pack islands is average island scale, right? That's going to try and make it proportional. So if it's big here, it's big there. So we'll run that first. Uh UV average island scale. Do I have this selected? No. Oh, I bet I know what's going on here with this. Is this a separate thing? Yes. Our zipper handle didn't have the scale applied, right? So, um once we do that, uh there we go. Now, is there anything else? Just a real quick. There we go. This one. Control A apply scale. I'm just looking for stuff that's not 111 because this is another place where the apply scale bug will sting you once again. Right. Right. In the way that the modifiers are applied and in the way that the UV proportionality is done. And so now if we grab everything uh and now I run this average island scale. Ah, right. The small has been made small. The large has been made large in our biblical realignment of UV islands. And we can now pack this again. Tada. There we go. All right. And so now this part here, I imagine, is the face. Uh, you can tell this this button up here links the selections between the windows. So that when I if I turn this on now, if I select something here, it selects it over there. Okay, that's not on by default. So because if it's on, I think the automatic UV unwrap doesn't happen. Anyways, regardless, um, that answers your question. Yes. >> Okay. Yes. Uh, good. the So, this is",
    "transcript_segment": "And we can again export this. Name it. Selected objects here. And again, we've been doing pretty well with the Substance Painter unwrap. Let's see how we do here. Here.

Um you can see this if you were to look at any sort of character UV map um that a lot of times I mean sometimes the character's face will have a separate its own texture set but like here right the face of this character is taking up I don't know two-fifths of the UV space when you know like this character's head is not two fifths of its actual, you know, volume or surface space, surface area, right? Does that make sense there? Right? Because we want more detail here and we don't need as much detail on the pants or whatever, right? Um, and so, and you know, like the head is much bigger in this case. So, uh, the command is before you run pack islands is average island scale, right? That's going to try and make it proportional. So if it's big here, it's big there. So we'll run that first. Uh UV average island scale. Do I have this selected? No. Oh, I bet I know what's going on here with this. Is this a separate thing? Yes. Our zipper handle didn't have the scale applied, right? So, um once we do that, uh there we go. Now, is there anything else? Just a real quick. There we go. This one. Control A apply scale. I'm just looking for stuff that's not 111 because this is another place where the apply scale bug will sting you once again. Right. Right. In the way that the modifiers are applied and in the way that the UV proportionality is done. And so now if we grab everything uh and now I run this average island scale. Ah, right. The small has been made small. The large has been made large in our biblical realignment of UV islands. And we can now pack this again. Tada. There we go. All right. And so now this part here, I imagine, is the face. Uh, you can tell this this button up here links the selections between the windows. So that when I if I turn this on now, if I select something here, it selects it over there. Okay, that's not on by default. So because if it's on, I think the automatic UV unwrap doesn't happen. Anyways, regardless, um, that answers your question. Yes. >> Okay. Yes. Uh, good. the So, this is"

Um, you're going to have the alpha channel in Substance Painter adding channels. So, under texture sets, this is a texture setting. And so, here under channels, there's two that you might want to apply. Um, Alicia is going to want to apply the alpha channel or add the alpha channel so that it becomes something that you can paint into. And then Zoe and perhaps others are going to want to add the emission channel so that you can make stuff glowy. Um, so you can just hit plus to add said channel. So emissive is fairly straightforward. The Yeah. Yes. Opacity. When it gets exported from here, it's going to be opacity. When we hook it up in Unity or Blender, Blender it's going to go into the alpha channel and in Unity it would go into the yeah alpha channel as well depending on if it gets depending on which shader you're using. Right? So not everyone needs to do this step. Okay. Now, um, now your painting becomes more complex in that you've got two more channels here that you can opt into, right? And so, say for instance, you wanted to paint some glowy stuff. You would turn on the emission. I want glowy red. And now I could paint glowy red stuff. It won't look very glowy here. Um, the amount of glow is ultimately something that you set in the final render destination. You can have it look glowy by adding a post effect here that has no bearing on what it looks like later on. The important part is that you've put data that's going to go into the channel. No data, no glow. But you know here if we want to see it we can come over here to display settings down to post effects down to glow glare glow bloom. Very little agreement on what to call this. Um there we go. And now I can yeah this is the here top there we go and so this is emissive channel and then you know to get a sense for it I could but you know this is just for you what to see while you're painting okay um to know that that's happening in the channel there. uh this be exported as a separate texture. Make sense? Okay. Uh, I think that combination of stuff covers. Why is this purple? Right. purple magenta in reacts to the lighting so it doesn't look magenta that it does when it doesn't find a texture in the other programs but everyone now knows that that's a GPU error and so here um we'd want to you know first round this and so Um because you're very stious with the quads, the subdivision surface kind of does it in one go, especially with shade smooth on there. Probably some sort of like cuff and other part here for communicating boot, right? And so uh or pants uh controlr this up and scale out and then controlr click in there we go scale this in there we go now we have pant and then here controlr right this is easy peasy because Jack was so um controlr R. And then usually with the bottom of the shoes, control R a loop in this direction to flatten it out. And then you could use the um faces and then extrude along normals to create like a sole of the shoe depending on how much of that you would do there. You get the idea. And then another controlr here to sort of flatten that out. Okay. So that gives you pants. You did the correct thing here. So that looks right. Um",

You know, again, depending on uh maybe giving the body a little more shape here if you were to move some of this. Okay, so this is good. Subdivided gives us more of a shape here, but we still are going to want to remsh this. And so let's go ahead and tab back out, right click, and convert to mesh. There we go. And now, uh, and um, I think this is happening because I didn't restart Blender. And so I need to keep dragging this add-on back into here. I didn't have this problem at home. Uh, there we go. There we go. And so here we do want it to be symmetrical on the world X and smoothing on. Let's say two and save and remsh. Yeah. And that gives us something that's very well distributed here. And so this is going to deform. And now it's fairly um pliable. You have some points to clean up there. You had some sort of topology problem in your crotch. Hate it when that happens. >> Maybe censoring myself a lot right now. Yeah. So, uh perhaps before doing the remsh, were there some issues here before? That look pretty good. Yeah, they're just overlapping there. So in the mirror, you almost always want this on so that it cuts off the excess stuff so it doesn't fold over and then fold over itself, right? And so now if we were to apply this, that'll should solve our crot crotch problem. Let's see. And now if I were to run this. There we go. Don't say I never help you out. Yeah, it's not performing super great there on the hand. So I'd go back and just inspect that before I ran that part. But that gets you very close there, right? In that, you know, because you're so fidious with your quad working there. The other thing here is just even, you know, shape. I would give this a little bit more of a, you know, a typical panel for the face in the front, right? Just shaped a little bit more like a hit there u before we bring it in. But e super easy to make these changes because we were there. And then once this does get um is this the remeshed version what if we gave it a little more? [Music] I had the sharp detect on. I bet that was part of what the problem was. Yeah. Yeah, it's not trying to do something weird there on the thumb. And so, oh, the other thing that you would definitely want to do here is make this symmetrical on the X. And so, one more time because that's going to make the UV unwrapping piece of cake. So, yeah, uh, super happy with this add-on for remshing. Can see nice. Yeah. Uh, super nice results. So, like even Bo, even in your case, we got the quad mesh out of um >> painter, right? But it, you know, it would be worth uh like with the teeth. The workflow I would I would try would be out of painter increasing the number of polies to so that the teeth are properly represented. then in here remsh again. I think this is going to do a better job of of taking care of that. Um and so yeah and so now uh in terms of do our things. Make sure that everything is um merge vertices. And then in your case for UVs and since you're in 185 um yeah the in this case the mark seams is you know you can use the seams for clothes as like a real good um starting point guide here. How's that wrapping around like that? Is that actually this is this is one issue. Let's see. Yeah. See, it kind of twists like that. That's I might just run it again to see if he can get it to do it so it doesn't twist like that. Um >> uh I'm not certain. Let's see what happens if we run the rematch again. I I mean if they stay that's probably undesirable in that you know like they're just going to be crunched. Um angle smoothing let's say no smoothing quadr singular iterations we have it symmetrical. There we go. Now we have discrete edge loops that you can mark as a seam. And uh yeah, the other seam was obliterated. So yeah, I mean a little bit of uh work there. Again, if you gave it um a bit of a you know, belt area, right, that would also help guide its uh subdivisions. So yeah. Okay. A little bit extra time today, but we're close there. So Gavin, based on those examples, you don't need to do your whole thing. You just need to apply that to your arm. >> Okay. And then Amy, your workflow is very close to what I did with Daenerys, right? Because you have a lot of those triangular shapes, right? And then Adrian, your workflow would be very close to what I just did here with Jack because you had the very blocky um quad-based flow at this point, right? >> What's that? >> Okay. Well, then maybe like if you're going to remake it, I would try to model Landon's workflow, right? Where he had the individual cylinders, right? So that that I think especially without as much modeling experience, just taking the shapes and moving them around, I think is an easier lift, right? And then we did we did the remesh modifier smooth maybe a little sculpt and then Q remeshify for the symmetricization of the rem remeshification. That's definitely how that should be said. Okay. Awesome everyone. Um, yeah. Alec, did you send me your blend file? Send, if you haven't, send it to me, send me the blend file so I can look at that that issue you're running into. It's got to be something with the triangles. The first thing I would try, Alec, is going back into Blender, running the merge vertices, then then sending it back out and see if you get that same paint issue. Something to do with the UVs. Okay, awesome. All right, so we're going to be bringing these into Painter and painting them. I'll also link to like two weeks ago Substance Painter lecture from 185 where I go into more detail there. Um, in terms of the stylistic thing, how much surface texture do you want on yours? Right? focus on the color overall and then we as you're slowly making your decisions about what the texture is looking for, what this shading is looking like overall for the game, we can decide what other parts need to be addressed there. Okay. All right. And so, yeah, that'll be the other thing I'll put in the assignment. have some references in terms of like the overall look of the shading of different game worlds or just different animated worlds so that we can sort of make a decision about what techniques you need to do shading wise to how we want to come out of Substance Painter there. What's going to make the most sense for your game sound good? These are cool characters. Uh I think this is coming along really well. Awesome.",

So in this render I apply the space. I place the single character on the left and and then leaving this large empty area on the right. This native space draws attention to the curtain. And I use the light and shadow to make the image more visually interesting and also use a dodge angle to make the composition more dynamic and inful. This is my my second render and focus and it focus on depth. I compose this scene with a clear foreground, midground, and background. By adjusting the depth of field, I blur the background to keep the viewers focus on the man running and also add some energy spheres through compositing to make the action more engaging. And the background itself is comes from a 2D asset that I integrated into the scene. For my third render, the principle is balance. I reuse some assets from last week's line composition. In this scene, the woman stands on top of the building. I aim for symmetry by placing both the woman and the moon at the center of the frame with these two buildings on the sides. And then also with the rooftop structure, I also use the the volume nodes combined with the gradient texture and the pearling noise to create subtle atmospheric lighting. The CS city lies below. Um then this last render demonstrates angles and compose the scen a scene of the man walking downstairs in a sural environment where multiple staircase go in different direction. The Dutch angle enhances the disorienting feeling making the space feel unstable. This is the frame I going to analyze from the third and the seven. It demonstrates several elements of composition like for example balance through the symmetrical arrangement of the seats and then there is also pattern because the same shure is repeated throughout the entire frame. There is also death as the shares become smaller the farther they are from the camera giving a strong sense of the spatial distribution. And finally, there is lines formed by the rows of the shirts that guide the viewer's eye to the toward the center. Even here in the upper rows, they point inward emphasizing the center. I think that the third and the seventh, even though is was released in 2009, is a stunning piece of digital art. I think it's impressive how everything was created with CI yet looks completely realistic. I think the film uses light composition and movement to make architecture feel like kind of alive and poetic. Um, that's everything for this week. I don't have any other question. Um, thanks for watching.",

Makes it seems like the shadow is reaching out there. So, really, really well done. Um, yeah, the Dutch angle part of it, you know, is just one of those things that if this were a shot that was in motion, it would be clearer. As a still, you're kind of in this category where it's like, is this an intentional Dutch angle or did this person just not, you know, align the photo in terms of how they wanted to sit in the frame? So there's there's that, you know, like if you're you know, if you want to put something in the front in the center of the frame, trying to be very precise, like this is going directly in the center of the frame versus like kind of off where it just kind of especially, you know, as someone presenting an image who doesn't have some sort of giant reputation behind them. One of the possible interpretations or likely interpretations is like, is this person doing this intentionally or are they just unaware of what they're doing? Right? As opposed to like some other, you know, if we're looking at the objects and images in context in the context of who made them, other people would have more of a reputation would be like, well, even though that looks off, that's clearly designed to be off. Whereas like especially with a lot of student work when you're presenting yourself at the beginning then you really want to be clear about that right because especially if you're submitting your portfolio for you know a contest or a prize or a scholarship or something you know that people someone's going to be looking at a lot of work and a lot of things that were unintentionally wrong right so if you're doing something that's intentionally um against the grain my advice would be to be very intentional about that very obvious as opposed to just sort of anything that looks kind of haphazard will be interpreted as haphazard. You know that's not fair but you know that's sort of my view of the lay of the land there. Yeah, this guy's getting a lot of usage here. Um does he have a name in Miximo? Is that like it's Remy? Remy? He looks like a Remy, I guess. Yeah, really good work. But this one I thought stood out as like uh my favorite one from that set. But yeah, you clearly have an understanding there. And then yeah, uh this I mean if I remember correctly in the interview, this was done with Vray. Does he talk about that in the interview? I linked to the interview. Yes. Um, so V-Ray would have been a separate render engine that was available still available for different programs, right? So you at the time you would have you would run via 3S Max and Vray or Maya and Vray and um and like I described before that would be a situation where unlike the situation we have with Blender and Cycles and EV you would need to have a whole separate set of materials, whole separate set of lights, whole separate set of cameras to work with that particular render engine. and uh you know I don't remember does he talk about how long it took to render those different scenes in the interview.

Having the angle of the light give us the line up to the hand like that. Um, it's really evocative. Makes it seems like the shadow is reaching out there. So, really, really well done. Um, yeah, the Dutch angle part of it, you know, is just one of those things that if this were a shot that was in motion, it would be clearer. As a still, you're kind of in this category where it's like, is this an intentional Dutch angle or did this person just not, you know, align the photo in terms of how they wanted to sit in the frame? So there's there's that, you know, like if you're you know, if you want to put something in the front in the center of the frame, trying to be very precise, like this is going directly in the center of the frame versus like kind of off where it just kind of especially, you know, as someone presenting an image who doesn't have some sort of giant reputation behind them.

And I think all the different uh kind of zigzagging of stairs also helps amplify that feeling. And next I have my balance, which I have three paintings and I have three candles all set up the same uh equal distance within the shot. And they have the depth which shows two characters, one with focus in the back, more going on in the frame than just one subject. And I have my space. And this is where I use our new volume method that we learned to make a gradient texture. So kind of looks like it's perhaps in the sea. And this is one still that stood out for me. I really liked how they he made this angle of the shot. It's very dramatic and striking. I also noticed that uh he does a lot of especially in the beginning a lot of these depth pulling shots where the depth of field and the focus changes. >> Yeah. So pulling focus changes the depth of field would be the vocabulary there a lot especially here shifts from the back to the front and a lot with this camera something that I liked about it. So that one in partic, you know, the the one that we've done already where we pulled focus, the camera stayed put and we just adjusted the focus distance, right? And so some of what's going on here, I have to look at this one again, but if if you move the camera, you have a very shallow depth of field. You get this shifting of what's in focus without even adjusting the focus distance, right? if the camera's moving. I really like the third and the seventh. It actually took me a while to figure out that it was computerenerated. Especially impressive to the fact that it was 15 years ago that this was made. Very fun video and pretty inspiring to to watch and kind of get into the mindset of learning this composition. Yeah, really great gauge. The This really struck me like this like looks very third and seventh inspired here. And um I'd be interested to know what the focal length is of the camera that you used here. I feel like perhaps it could be a lower focal length if you wanted to get more of that looming sense here. Um, you know, like looking up at the thing because that would cause the or a little bit of lens uh would cause more of the lens distortion where this part of the frame would be expanding there. Uh, and so that but I'd be interested to know what the focal length is here. Remember the default is 50. Why is that the default? >> Yeah. Like so it's that makes sense, right? But when you want to start really manipulating how people feel about the image or the feelings you're trying to invoke in the image, you know, really making a decision there, right? That's the biggest thing all around is like not not taking the really thinking about all of the settings, not just taking the defaults because they're the defaults. Cool. Yeah, I really love the the red film negatives there. Those are really that's one of my favorites. This shot looks great. The the only thing is the the this struck me as like maybe this pattern is squished in this direction, but I could be wrong. Like I just thought it looked like it should be more perfectly diamond shaped. And that's the kind of thing that happens. You know, you're throwing a material on a plane and then, you know, kind of dialing in the scale or whatever. And if that was a little bit off, that sort of took me out of it. But yeah, this is a definitely a nice composition there. Yeah, the lighting. Angie says she likes the lighting here. So, a light in the center.

It's just a whole lot of play with light and some fabrics and, you know, flooring and pretty much, you know, you name it, it was in this scene. And I tried to make it balanced without making it identical on both sides. changed the lighting several times and then I realized that the white rug was absorbing a lot of the light so I removed that. That's what I learned from that is that you need surfaces to bounce light off of. Yeah, exactly. I mean, did uh did many of you end up using that technique for cycles, like putting the thing seen in a box or something like that to get more bounce light in, especially if it was indoor inside. If it's outside, you may not have as much of that happening. And I have my depth shot, just a broken down phone booth in the middle of the Rocky Mountains.

This particular frame interests me because the leading lines are there. The repetitive sort of ribs along the walls and ceiling form some converging lines that guide your gaze through the corridor. These lines are emphasizing the directionality and a sense of being drawn to the end of the passage almost like a funnel, a clear single vanishing point at the corridor's end. All the rib lines and floor lines visually converge there creating like an illusion of greater length. Balance is there as well. It's symmetrical along the center axis.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 15, 2025 Student Feedback: Balance and Lighting Techniques Hello. Hello. Here are my renders for this week, as well as the inspiration slash references I pulled from. Starting off with my space render, I used the positive space of the character in the center of the shot surrounded by the negative space of the environment. I feel that this element helps give a feeling of isolation. So, that's the vibe I was going for. For my depth render, I put the sword in the foreground and the character in the background with some depth of field. With this one, I think it works well to demonstrate that the objects in the fore and background have a direct relevance to each other. In my balance render, I really like the idea from my reference that the visual balance of a shot can allude to imbalance between the characters. So, I used the lighting and positioning of the characters to try and achieve that idea. And for my angle render, I tilted the camera to contrast with all the wouldbe horizontal lines in the shot. I think this is helpful in communicating that something is odd or offputting about the scene. From this video, I chose this frame. I think it's a good demonstration of balance with the symmetry of the room. And the asymmetry of the canvas is also an attention grabber. And I also liked this angled line from the door on the left into the canvas, then the couch, the cubes, and the identical door on the right. No questions, but a quick Blender tip I learned this week is about light linking. So, in this render, I wanted some extra shine on this sword, but I didn't want to make lights that would affect the rest of the scene. So, to do that, you just make whatever light you want. Come into the object properties, shading, and light linking. Select the collection that your objects are in, and then you can either select the objects you want to be affected or unselect the objects you don't want to be affected. So, for example, if I select the walls, the light will start to affect that as well. Also, if you haven't figured this out, if you want to lock the camera to view, instead of coming here and doing that, you can just um go to your camera view and click this lock and it will do the same thing. So, yeah. Thank you. >> Once you're in once you're looking through the camera, once you press zero, you press the lock. Okay, that's shorter. Cool. The light linking thing I think is newish in one of like within the last couple versions. Has anyone downloaded five yet? They just releas official there yet. But that which tab was that in shading on the light to then opt in and out of whichever ones you want. Cool. That makes a big difference. Yeah. On on our dagger there. And was the flame part of the candle asset? This one really caught my eye when I was flipping through Discord. Are these Mixmo characters or No, she is, right? >> They both are. Okay. Yeah, it seems like their texture is a little bit more detailed than some of the other characters, but maybe it's just because of the design. I don't know. Which movie is this from? >> Which one? >> Okay. Is this whiplash? Yeah.",

Uh, here's angle. Here's balance. Um, I'm happy with depth. Uh, using the propaganda poster in the background as the focus and added a little light there. And then, uh, this is space. Um, here is my own angle. I'm using Deadpool. um and just sitting on the edge. Um kind of replicating the beginning of the first Deadpool movie. I think is the first one anyway where he's sitting like that drawing and then he falls into the car. Um this shows space um as there's a lot of space. You get to see the little river bed wash underneath. uh just the the scale of it. Like he's like small in comparison to the the cars and stuff. Uh here's balance. Um I went with the little happy birthday uh party um thing. Um I just I wanted to keep everything like centered and like symmetrical a little bit. Um so balanced in that like the chairs are on either side. There's same number of presents. Um, it's all balanced around the cake. Um, here is death. Um, totally did not misread that as death. I'm I'm joking. Um, so, uh, death is just impatient, waiting for this guy to die. Uh, this one was, um, interesting actually because I used a blur. Um, I rendered the guy and the car separately. And then I used a No, I think I duplicated I duplicated him and then changed the opacity to kind of give that like double effect of like when you're looking in the distance at something like the stuff in the foreground like doubles. >> So you like duplicated the mesh or like in in compositing the render. Okay. uh the so I did that um to try to give that little extra sense of depth. Uh and then uh here's space. Uh this is supposed to be blood spraying. Uh this I spent forever working on this and it didn't turn out as as I wanted, but I literally spent hours uh working on this. Uh, if you noticed in my discord, is this this character's blood? >> So, you know, the trope of like two samurai characters from each other. >> Okay. And so the is the blood an image that you comped on or is it >> particles? >> It's particles. Okay. >> Message about being really patient.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 15, 2025 Student Feedback: Minecraft and Space Renders >> Okay. Well, you know, you you're here, we can see you. So, like there's that. Um, yeah, if it's going to tank your, you know, performance. The Yeah, those that's a really good technique for lightning making that happen. The other thing you might be able to do there is, you know, for different kinds of lightning, you could um just vary the thickness of it. So you could do that either um by hand with the this one. So you can make parts thicker and then parts thinner or Yeah. So, randomize, but then for lightning, you don't want it to be scribbly like that. So, if you grabbed all of the points and set it to angular, you wouldn't get any curved lines. I thought maybe I had a add-on. I thought there was a way I could randomize the radius on all the points at the same time, but I I'd have to look. So, there's that. And then if you converted to mesh, if you then remshed and then convert the mesh. And then that's too many. That's still two. That doesn't work. So subdividing the curve then randomizing that's better and then you could grab individual curve parts and shrink or expand those. I think at one point I Does anyone Does anyone else have that an add-on that randomized all the thicknesses? I can't I thought I had something like that at some point. I'll have to look. Yeah. So, subdividing the curve or subdividing the Yeah, the curve object even though it's not curvy because he's at the liner, but then that would start to give that kind of look. But those are all really good. I mean, this one, especially for being this, like I thought this one reads pretty well as lightning, but you know, like this one being closer to the camera should be like more blown out, you know, like like the crank the emission even higher on that. Um, >> yeah, >> cool. Okay, >> yeah, >> cool. Great. Here's >> Hi, it's Crimson and these are my compositions. Now, for the first one here, this is for balance. Let me render it out real quick so you can see it better. So, what I did for this, it it's a little silly, but when I was looking for models of birds, cuz I wanted to do something with birds, I found like Minecraft chickens. And I thought it'd be funny if I could find more Minecraft models, and I did. So, it's just something really simple. Just two Minecraft chickens on the side and then a creeper in the middle. So, it creates this kind of triangle. And even though the background isn't symmetrical like this being symmetrical in the middle, it helps create balance. And also I had a light just to make it more the help the creeper stand out against the background because without it he kind of blended in. Also with depth of field it did that. So that is my balance render. And then for the second one we have space. Now, this one I wanted it to be similar like the examples shown um during class because I really like the like big overarching space and the shadows and the character in the middle. But this one I wanted it to be more intimidating. So, I have this big creepy looking guy facing this light and having the water be like reflected around him, a little mountain in the background, and just really it creates a sort of like powerful feel because of how empty everything else is around it. So, overall, like this one, this one's okay. Like, I couldn't really think of anything more creative to do with space, but I like the overall vibes and aesthetic I got from this. This one's my depth render. Um, this is the one I used. I used cycles for this one. And so, overall, I just wanted to make some I I really like the cars that we used um earlier with our motion blur. So, I used a car and I really wanted to just make like a little neighborhood and a road and stuff and have this guy like just walking down the street or whatever. And there's just this cool car. So, you want to pay attention to the car and not the guy because he's not the main subject. He kind of just helps fill the frame. So, overall, I like the way this one's set up. I like the the way the HDR >> Does he know he's not the main subject? Cuz he kind of looks like >> affected the reflections. I really like how the mirrors look with cycles and the HDR that I used or the windows, not mirrors. I think it looks really nice on the car. And then for my final one, we have angle. Now, this one's my favorite one. Um, if you couldn't tell, I like space stuff because I swear in all these compositions on I have to have one that has to do with space. Um, so I found this really cute robot and I decided that he would be he's not a Mars rover, but something kind of similar. So, I made sure that I had this plane that um I used the texture that had displacement so it could be more bumpy and seem like a planet surface. And then I put a mountain in the background. I made the background a little blurry because the mountain didn't exactly match the plane that I used for the foreground. And this robot was just super cute. I really like the way the HDR affected it. I had like two point lights, one was pink and one was orange to try to create more interesting shadows and light. And just overall just the slight angle to make the composition more dynamic. I think this one's pretty cool. And for the third and the seventh, um, I decided to pick this frame because I feel like it uses a lot of things really effectively. Like it uses line cuz it has all like the strings through it and helps guide your eye. So there's actual line and then implied line for the actual pictures hung up. It has pattern with the background all being lined up and then also technically the pictures strung up is also helping create pattern. It has depth because the pictures in the very very front are blurred and the pictures in the very very back are blurred. So is the background. So it really draws your eye to these middle ones. Overall, I just think this is like really great composition and it's really visually interesting. Hi, it's Crimson and these are my comp. >> Cool. Uh, great. Yeah, this is really great. the the Minecraft thing works. Um, but yeah, you've definitely because I remember your other one that you did with the Nebula HDR looked really good. Yeah, this one feels feels great. And the Dutch angle is very Dutch. So that feels like clearly intentional. Um, here. Yeah. The the only thing here like if this is the beginning of like an actual shot in this character is walking into the light that would be good as a still the like this the main we don't have enough edge lighting on the character to really understand any part of its silhouette or shape there. And so that I think you know as a still the lighting here on the character itself would need to be a little bit uh more defined because if we just looked at the you know brightness of the image, it's just this part here that is orders of magnitude brighter than the rest of the the image itself. And so this is the clearly the important subject, but this is the by far the brightest thing in the scene. So, um, yeah, this one, like, you did a good job setting everything up. It looks a little flat here, like maybe I mean, we have some depth of field because this gentleman is definitely out of focus, but then it feels strange that he's out of focus, but the background is totally clear at all times. Like, if That feels weird from like a depth of field perspective. And then yeah, like the car would have some kind of motion blur on it if it's moving. So there's that. It just it's a little flat compared to some of the other ones, but good. Nice.",

So, I have this big creepy looking guy facing this light and having the water be like reflected around him, a little mountain in the background, and just really it creates a sort of like powerful feel because of how empty everything else is around it. So, overall, like this one, this one's okay. Like, I couldn't really think of anything more creative to do with space, but I like the overall vibes and aesthetic I got from this. This one's my depth render. Um, this is the one I used. I used cycles for this one. And so, overall, I just wanted to make some I I really like the cars that we used um earlier with our motion blur. So, I used a car and I really wanted to just make like a little neighborhood and a road and stuff and have this guy like just walking down the street or whatever. And there's just this cool car. So, you want to pay attention to the car and not the guy because he's not the main subject. He kind of just helps fill the frame. So, overall, I like the way this one's set up. I like the the way the HDR >> Does he know he's not the main subject? Cuz he kind of looks like >> affected the reflections. I really like how the mirrors look with cycles and the HDR that I used or the windows, not mirrors. I think it looks really nice on the car. And then for my final one, we have angle. Now, this one's my favorite one. Um, if you couldn't tell, I like space stuff because I swear in all these compositions on I have to have one that has to do with space. Um, so I found this really cute robot and I decided that he would be he's not a Mars rover, but something kind of similar. So, I made sure that I had this plane that um I used the texture that had displacement so it could be more bumpy and seem like a planet surface. And then I put a mountain in the background. I made the background a little blurry because the mountain didn't exactly match the plane that I used for the foreground. And this robot was just super cute. I really like the way the HDR affected it. I had like two point lights, one was pink and one was orange to try to create more interesting shadows and light. And just overall just the slight angle to make the composition more dynamic. I think this one's pretty cool. And for the third and the seventh, um, I decided to pick this frame because I feel like it uses a lot of things really effectively. Like it uses line cuz it has all like the strings through it and helps guide your eye. So there's actual line and then implied line for the actual pictures hung up. It has pattern with the background all being lined up and then also technically the pictures strung up is also helping create pattern. It has depth because the pictures in the very very front are blurred and the pictures in the very very back are blurred. So is the background. So it really draws your eye to these middle ones. Overall, I just think this is like really great composition and it's really visually interesting. Hi, it's Crimson and these are my comp. >> Cool. Uh, great. Yeah, this is really great. the the Minecraft thing works. Um, but yeah, you've definitely because I remember your other one that you did with the Nebula HDR looked really good. Yeah, this one feels feels great. And the Dutch angle is very Dutch. So that feels like clearly intentional. Um, here. Yeah. The the only thing here like if this is the beginning of like an actual shot in this character is walking into the light that would be good as a still the like this the main we don't have enough edge lighting on the character to really understand any part of its silhouette or shape there. And so that I think you know as a still the lighting here on the character itself would need to be a little bit uh more defined because if we just looked at the you know brightness of the image, it's just this part here that is orders of magnitude brighter than the rest of the the image itself. And so this is the clearly the important subject, but this is the by far the brightest thing in the scene. So, um, yeah, this one, like, you did a good job setting everything up. It looks a little flat here, like maybe I mean, we have some depth of field because this gentleman is definitely out of focus, but then it feels strange that he's out of focus, but the background is totally clear at all times. Like, if That feels weird from like a depth of field perspective. And then yeah, like the car would have some kind of motion blur on it if it's moving. So there's that. It just it's a little flat compared to some of the other ones, but good. Nice."

Hey, this is Jack with ABC240, and we're going to be taking a look at the renders for this week. face render. The idea I was going for was just provide a big open landscape, have a character be like the the sense of scale for the environment. So, I mean, obviously, I mean, we know mountains are huge, but um I was hoping that by adding a little little guy at his little campfire here, you know, you barely even see him, just this tiny little guy, and he's in this huge expansive mountainscape. Um, so I thought this really accentuated uh the space of the environment. I actually did all the renders in cycles. I did some like noncycle versions of them, but my favorite ones were definitely the cycle versions. Look at the depth render. Um, so of the environment. >> So is this the volutric fog here on the bottom? >> That's probably HDR. >> Okay. Okay. I was going to say that you like if it is, you wrangled that really really well. >> I actually did all the renders in cycles. I did some like non-cycle versions of them, but my favorite ones were definitely the cycle versions. Look at the depth render. Um, so what I was going for here, it's the same character, but he's got his sword pointed to the to the camera and really just trying to accentuate depth here and a very very shallow uh depth of field. So yeah, like it's just this tip that's in focus and everything else is out of focus. And I think it looks so cool with the sword like the perspective of the sword like fading off quickly into depth into the depth of field. Cool. And I used the um uh compositing tools in Blender. I thought this was really cool. Fog glow I think is is what it's called. So yeah, this really this this is it without it. So yeah, I think it takes a good advantage good advantage of depth. You've got the tip of the sword and also you've got this character that's out of focus. Um let's take a look at balance. Um balance was difficult for me to do. balance is kind of like, you know, up to one's interpretation of like how it's getting balanced. The main thing I was going for here was um I had the golden triangle uh overlay. So, yeah, we've got the the the line that goes all the way across and we've got the two lines that come up. So, I placed my two points of focus in those right in those points. I've got my character here with the big sword looking over this uh gra sword graveyard. And then um on this specific one, there's a helmet with some fireflies um on it. Maybe showing um this is someone he knew. So I thought this was kind of a cool like story building p uh image. Beyond that, like I tried to balance like other points of focus. So like higher ground over here and lower ground over here, less interest in the background and more interest in the background. So it's kind of like I mean you can kind of see a line right down the middle here where it's like low low amount of stuff, high amount of stuff. So yeah, I tried to balance in multiple ways, but I don't know if I actually fully did that well. But I I think I think this feels good and I really like this. I I mean this was super cool to to do all this posing and stuff. So angle render. Um I thought this is really cool. I have this camera right behind uh this poor knight who's been on all these adventures so far. And uh I think he's finally met his doom on this with this assassin or I don't know. Maybe he'll maybe he'll make a comeback. But yeah, I thought this really cool angle and um yeah, it's just right behind his shoulder. So like you're almost like there with them. And yeah, it's just super ominous. I added this um point light here that I used with the glare to give it like shining tip of the dagger. We got the moon in the background. I just I thought this was super cool. And I think the angle really plays into like one, the fact that it's lower to the ground is very um makes you feel smaller. And then also just this at an angle just feels very just uneasy. I want to talk about this frame because I think this kind of accentuates a lot of what we're talking about. So we've got the shape in the middle with that. It's like contrasting the patterns. So, we got the pattern of the sky and the pattern of all of these windows. Very contrasty. We're also playing a bit with ang we're playing with a lot of stuff here. We're playing with lines as well of of of the lines leading up to the sky. We've got the angle of the camera going straight up at an angle offset from the frame of the camera. Also, space. I think this accentuates space very well. You've got this huge tall array of windows and then you just goes into the sky. It's like, yeah, this is very um kind of spacious, but also at the same time feels a little claustrophobic, too, cuz you're you're kind of trapped in here. And he had a lot of cool shots in this. I think it's really impressive that he did all this 15 years ago. That's super amazing. And just the amount of realism that he's able to get in so many >> I'm glad you didn't say it was super long ago. >> These shots just super cool, super inspiring, too, that you that techn got better than this. So, you know, we can do this and better probably. So, um I don't have >> Yeah, I mean the the absolutely the fact he's able to, you know, there weren't a lot of renders that looked like this at that time, you know, but you know, it's his artistic vision here that really overrides, you know, that's the primary driving factor here. um you know he had the same tools everyone else did at the time and was still still able to you know visualize and manifest this you know >> have any questions or anything so thank you for watching and bye >> yeah this one's really successful I like this a lot so yeah this technique that you did here I thought we needed that here >> I did do it but it's just not as",

In the other class. >> This is Gavin. >> It's all running together. >> And uh starting off here I'm just going to talk about the um third. You cut it off before the bell sound. >> Yeah, but but you didn't get the ding ding. >> Then the seventh. Uh so this film was made in 2009 uh to answer that question on on canvas. Um and then I chose this shot because I think it just shows a lot of the different elements of composition we've learned so far. Uh first we got the shape clearly. We have a square here um which is being made from these four walls. And then these four walls, there's a lot of line being used here as well, that element because we got the lines going up from the perspective uh shot here. And then we also have lines going across on all four of these sides. And and it's cool cuz each thing leads into the other because then the line leads into angle. We have a bu a bunch of right angles going across. We got right angle there. Boom, boom, boom. And it just keeps going. And then also the squared um angles there too. And then lastly, we have uh depth here because these bubbles here in the front, they are more in focus, but as you get into the background, they get much more out of focus and you can't see them. So yeah, that's uh and Oh, yeah. And I I enjoyed this film actually. I didn't think it was going to be that interesting when I started it, but the way it it's done with >> kind of like the stuff I usually make you watch, like not that interesting. >> The music is actually really just visually like satisfying to look at and uh it's just cool to see these kind of surreal uh just strange compositions. It's really cool. We got we got a great show for you today, folks. Uh so the first shot here is my angle shot. Um, as you can see here, the main thing you'll notice is the constant repeating 90° angles going down these staircases going down. I hope that's the first thing you notice at least. I mean, other than the like giant looming guy here and the things, but the main point of this was to have that repeated angle. And I think it does well. And especially cuz this character in the front is even following that same 90° angle um continuity. Uh and then I also used the principled volume scatter for the back for the fog. And I played around with like the pear and noise and the uh gradient texture stuff to kind of fine-tune it a little better than like last week when I was just using the volume scatter. So, this one we got, as you can see, we got Marky Mark. >> I am a peacock. >> Hopefully, that's playing the sound that I set up here. >> Um, have you seen that movie? >> I have no idea what that is from. >> It's from the the other guys. The one I was talking about like like his best comedic performance. Yeah. >> No, I just looked up sound effect. >> That's what came up. I'm a peacock. I gota fly. >> Yeah. By the way, I got the soundboard kind of set up. So, there you go. Uh, I am a peacock. You got to let me fly. >> So, yeah, we got this is the balance one, I believe. Uh, you can see in a bathroom setting. Um, very symmetrical shot, but also just balance like neither side is getting your attention more than the other hopefully. Uh, because same amount of urinal on each side. tried to get like everything symmetrical, the tiles and everything. Um, and yeah, this is some some type of meeting is happening here. And uh, I'm just saying if you know my game and ABC 200, you know, you can form some theories. Uh, so this is the depth shot. Um, as you can see, Marky Mark, uh, whatever Mark Wahlberg, that's his name. I keep forgetting it. He's looking in. He's supposed to be looking in the bathroom mirror, but it doesn't really come across like that. So, >> so did you rigged this Mark Wahberg like you did LeBron to use the Mixmo stuff or did this Wahberg come rigged? >> It was I mean the model was on Sketch and then I mix >> Okay. Yep. >> Yeah. The likeness is like close. for that reason. It's probably my least favorite of the of the shots, but I still think it's cool. Um, I think it does its job because, as you can see, he's in focus. The middle ground is less out of focus, and then the background is even more out of focus. So, there's three clear layers and that's creating depth, even if it doesn't look like a bathroom mirror necessarily. You know, this is my favorite shot that I made. Uh this is for space and uh as you can see that we got the two characters on the bottom here. But the first thing that clearly gets your attention is the giant painting here in the middle. Um and then that kind of leads you to wonder like what does the painting have to do with these two characters? Like why is it so prominent? And I have my reasons like for what I was thinking with this um but and they're probably pretty obvious. Uh, this painting, by the way, is I forget the name of it, but I remember I found it in my art history class and I really it just kind of stuck with me. So, I saw this as a great opportunity to kind of show it off cuz I love this painting. Um, and then I these paintings, by the way, are the 2D assets that I use since one had to use 2D assets. Uh, I use them here as just planes and I made the frames myself. Uh, and uh, I think that's, you know, I think that's pretty much it. Uh, I don't have any other questions. Uh, you know, I I just I hope you guys have a have a great great day. >> Hi everybody. So, this is G. >> Did you make this for this video? This thing? >> I have to find like a website that automatically makes it. Okay. >> It was actually hard to find one that was good and then I typed in my name. >> It It automatically generates these like >> it's like because like normally it would say like your name here or something. >> Right. Right. Right. >> This one's really great. Have you seen characters? Did you actually have a mirror or what? >> Okay. I modeled this like a year >> for >> might as well use it. It's just a really it's like a material that's just really But but but it is like >> there's a there's a room and then there's like a glass thing. You're looking at the mirror in this shot. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I I mean if just a little bit of smudge on the mirror would totally sell it, you know, in terms of Yeah. Ain't no bathroom mirror this clean anywhere, especially public bathrooms. So yeah, the but this one here again playing with the scale, you know, the the giant person, right? Especially when we have the, you know, tiny or regular sized people, right? Whatever whatever is happening here. But yeah, this one was really great for sure. And so you po did is this one that you brought into mix or is this was this one already rigged? >> Mix. >> Okay. >> Okay. >> All right. Is that everybody? I think that's everybody. No, actually it's not that hard. OBS. Yeah, I set it to a bad one because every time I click it, it would go backwards. I need to change everyone's pres. >> Angie asked if you composed the music. >> I wish. No, I didn't.",
    "transcript_segment": ">> Hi everybody. So >> no wait we do we already watch yours or No. No. Okay. Yeah. In the other class. >> This is Gavin. >> It's all running together. >> And uh starting off here I'm just going to talk about the um third. You cut it off before the bell sound. >> Yeah, but but you didn't get the ding ding. >> Then the seventh. Uh so this film was made in 2009 uh to answer that question on on canvas. Um and then I chose this shot because I think it just shows a lot of the different elements of composition we've learned so far. Uh first we got the shape clearly. We have a square here um which is being made from these four walls. And then these four walls, there's a lot of line being used here as well, that element because we got the lines going up from the perspective uh shot here. And then we also have lines going across on all four of these sides. And and it's cool cuz each thing leads into the other because then the line leads into angle. We have a bu a bunch of right angles going across. We got right angle there. Boom, boom, boom. And it just keeps going. And then also the squared um angles there too. And then lastly, we have uh depth here because these bubbles here in the front, they are more in focus, but as you get into the background, they get much more out of focus and you can't see them. So yeah, that's uh and Oh, yeah. And I I enjoyed this film actually. I didn't think it was going to be that interesting when I started it, but the way it it's done with >> kind of like the stuff I usually make you watch, like not that interesting. >> The music is actually really just visually like satisfying to look at and uh it's just cool to see these kind of surreal uh just strange compositions. It's really cool. We got we got a great show for you today, folks. Uh so the first shot here is my angle shot. Um, as you can see here, the main thing you'll notice is the constant repeating 90° angles going down these staircases going down. I hope that's the first thing you notice at least. I mean, other than the like giant looming guy here and the things, but the main point of this was to have that repeated angle. And I think it does well. And especially cuz this character in the front is even following that same 90° angle um continuity. Uh and then I also used the principled volume scatter for the back for the fog. And I played around with like the pear and noise and the uh gradient texture stuff to kind of fine-tune it a little better than like last week when I was just using the volume scatter. So, this one we got, as you can see, we got Marky Mark. >> I am a peacock. >> Hopefully, that's playing the sound that I set up here. >> Um, have you seen that movie? >> I have no idea what that is from. >> It's from the the other guys. The one I was talking about like like his best comedic performance. Yeah. >> No, I just looked up sound effect. >> That's what came up. I'm a peacock. I gota fly. >> Yeah. By the way, I got the soundboard kind of set up. So, there you go. Uh, I am a peacock. You got to let me fly. >> So, yeah, we got this is the balance one, I believe. Uh, you can see in a bathroom setting. Um, very symmetrical shot, but also just balance like neither side is getting your attention more than the other hopefully. Uh, because same amount of urinal on each side. tried to get like everything symmetrical, the tiles and everything. Um, and yeah, this is some some type of meeting is happening here.

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 15, 2025 Compositing Techniques and Blend Modes >> Yeah. And don't worry, they're all um yeah, the we haven't had a whole lot of problems with that recently. I tried doing that. Okay. So, what Jack was talking about being able to have like a warm glow around the sword and then also like a, you know, like a glint or lens flare on it at the same time. Doing both of those things. So, the lens distortion is just out of the loop here. We're just doing Let me just disconnect that for a second. Um, and so our mix color here um is going to be our friend. So, we have just just glowing here, right? And I'm gonna grab this one and duplicate it. And then on this one I'm going to run let's make this a separate thing. And on this one, instead of bloom here, we have the star. There we go. So, it's kind of just happening in that area. Um, sometimes these are more adjustable than others. Yeah, streak gives us more. There we go. So, the sideways here. Um, a lot of the lenses used to shoot two 39 to1, you know, this anamorphic um aspect ratio, the way they interact with the light, you often get these lens flares that are very horizontal like so. And so here our streaks in the glare give us this. And yeah, you can dial that to whatever you would want. But if it's just over here at two, it gives us something that looks like a lens flare. Um, you could also adjust all the angle here at the same time. This iterations was kind of changing the length of it so that it fades out a little bit more. There we go. All right. So, it's really exaggerated there, but just to make a point. And so, we've got this and then we've also got this. And we want to do both, right? And so, the blend modes from your Photoshop, right? the I have two things and I want to brighten one with the other. That's going to be our add blend mode, right? We're going to add it on top. That's what glow is. You blur and then you put it in the add it back in as a with the add blend mode. That's the formula if you have to make blur glow from scratch. And then if you need to darken the one above with the one below, that's going to be multiply and that family of um blend modes. And so in our case, we want, you know, to have both of these things brightening the same clip. And so we can put them together here and here and then mixing it under here. Right? So the the uh grouping here is for your benefit. All of you know add what I just said if you have to brighten one with the other. All of these are different slightly different algorithms that end up brightening both of them. All of these are slightly different algorithms that end up darkening one with the other. And so by putting them both into here, you know, compo, this is compositing both of those layers together, going into the, you know, just so we can see it there. Um, gives us both of those things. We're getting the haze from the, you know, just general glow here, and then we're also getting the streaks over here. Now uh and then that's add there's color dodge there's screen right so um part of the difference in the algorithms here is like what happens when we get if we normalize pixel brightness zero is black one is white but depending on a bunch of things we can go above one and what happens when we go above one does it wrap around does it interact with the glow. There's We'll come back to that. Anyways, lighten add the other one. Soft light. No, that doesn't all look like soft light in Photoshop. But all of those are, you know, adding one to the other. um versus if we needed to darken one with the other. I mean, this probably won't look like much here. But I mean, that's interesting the way that it breaks up the lens blur. I like that. But I might then, you know, like that versus this again. See how we get more interesting information there in the lens blur. And so what if I wanted both of those things? I could just composite twice. And so this one is giving me that cool lens flare thing. And then I could then uh sort of composite it again with itself here and here, but using the add and then come out to here. Right? And so I'll get that more complex stuff happening there plus the other thing. And right so every time you're using the mix color node, this is like functionally like adding another layer in Photoshop, right? Um I like this better just because the you know the flow the flow of data becomes clear here and then also doing things like this where you send the same information to two areas is very clean when you're doing this nodal interface in layers or like in substance painter. That's, you know, what anchor points are, right? Which is you're essentially duplicating the data and sending it to another part of the layer stack, but it's not as visually obvious there. But with nodes, it's all right there. Um, right. And so part of the other reason I'm really bullish on this part of Blender, it's going to get more updates. Like I just watched a talk from Blender Con about the updates coming to the compositing system and yeah I mean because photo after effects does not have this kind of nodal view right and the two main you know compositing programs are going to be you know after effects which everyone is aware of and then Um, take my time nuke. That's right. N was just escaping me. I've used After Effects way more because we have, you know, we've been using the Adobe stuff for a long time, but Nuke uh in Nuke the data flows down kind of like um Houdini, but um yeah, we have this is some sort of massive compositing chain here, you know, where in Blender we're flowing left to right. Um, yeah. So, Nuke has been its own program that's been used for this for a long time. Um, the other I don't know if you guys did you guys do any Blackmagic in 215 last spring resolve or Da Vinci Resolve. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So, Da Vinci Resolve is the other free program that's the base program is more of a um uh has parody with Premiere, you know, like as a film editing program, but um Blackmagic also makes a compositing program called Fusion. And there's a version of fusion that it's like built in to um uh blackmagic and again it's a nodal representation of this where we have this kind of thing happening right and so yeah having this starting this is really becoming pretty useful here in Blender to do all of this here right not for a lot of shots not having to go out to somewhere else uh in that you have access to all these things here. Um yeah, so like this is by far one of the most important nodes, right? The color mix node, right? That's the actual compositing. You're compositing something over something. And so you can continue to do that kind of thing. Let's say like over here like this got too bright and so I wanted to um you know control the curves on this. So there and so I need more uh contrast on this one. Right. And so getting this is just controlling and sort of crushing the darks here uh on the one that's coming into this input there. So we can get, you know, more contrast but still get that more interesting lens flare there plus, you know, the general haze from the bloom. So between that and then you know perhaps mixing in some of the lens distortion starts to give us you know, a lot more interest on the edges of the lens flare, right? So, again, just this lot more interesting small detail that really makes this speak as a composition, you know. Um, cool. All right. So, that's that's",

    "title": "Grease Pencil Drawing Strategies",
    "video_id": "u2KRnY5E8yw",
    "search_text": "AVC240 October 15, 2025 Grease Pencil Drawing Strategies exactly what you're talking about, right? Okay. Um let's save incremental on that over here. The so for our shot sizes right using one of the monsters for half of them and then the other one. Let's go ahead and do this deduce style grease pencil composition. So let's look at the grease pencil thing again real quick here. Um sort of So if I make a new grease pencil stroke behind the scenes, as far as I understand, the core of this is just like the curve stuff. And so you know, like to edit this, tab in, delete the existing points like you do with a curve. And then we can be in draw mode to draw. So the way I was thinking about organizing this um three draw I don't want to call them modes because we already already have modes. Three draw strategies for grease pencil. Uh one is draw parallel to camera. Two would be draw on geo. sometimes um keeping the original geo other times not and just you know using it as a uh you know canvas for lack of a better word right to organize the stuff in space right because all all of this is necessary because it's two-dimensional drawing right we the mouse or even if you're using the tablet it's still 2D right but we want to do it in 3D space. And so this is why this is necessary. Uh or three uh draw draw 2D in 3D space. Uh this is the one that's really is to my knowledge like unique to Blender, this mode here. The other ones are not really, you know, particularly technically amazing, but you know, super useful. Okay, so these three different ways to build out this, you know, 2D looking thing, but in 3D space, right? So number one, just drawing parallel to camera. And so if I'm in draw mode here and uh I'm just drawing this is all parallel to whatever the viewport is at this point right in space at some sort of specific distance. Uh the distance here uh by default is going to be the um origin of the scene. And so if I move this way and do it this way, you can see that all of these lines kind of end up pointing back to the origin here just because of the way, you know, the the plane that we're drawing on is very much like this plane, right? the one that's being visualized with the frost drum of the camera, right? And so it's like you're scribbling on that and that's where it sticks in space because the mouse is only giving it two-dimensional information that how far is it from the camera has to be manufactured some way via the system here. Um, so that's useful. And then you uh drawing in the orthographic views allows you to you know uh line things up in a way that would be useful. Oh, and just move the floor down. Right. So I can make something that's at a right angle to something else just by flipping the orthographic views there and lining it up because the orthographic view is two dimensional. And so this is all what was under number one there. Right? We're parallel to the view that we're currently looking at it with the come back. Select the grease pencil object. That gives me back draw mode which I can come back to here. And then drawing on something. And so switching it to a surface. And now this projects from the view onto whatever it hits first. And so this, you know, makes it really easy to do things something like this. You know, if I want to turn this into some sort of house, right, that sticks to the surface. And then later I can either choose to um you know keep this here or not. Right. And it has that. So not only I mean drawing on the front face there is obvious but then also um coming back to here back to here right I could continue to do whatever I would need to. I could tab back out and start to, you know, give myself more of a template when I would need it, especially if I'm not going to be using this seeing it in the view later. And so, uh, here, here, here, extrude, scale, right? Some sort of roof. Now I have more of a guide here to use. And so I could come back here to tab back out. Come back here to draw once I select the grease pencil object to here. And so now I have more of a by default it's always at 50% opacity. Seems like a weird setting. Right? And so now the only part where this gets dangerous is when you approach the silhouette of it, right? Because the projection technique breaks down and you get that where it just sort of like spews it back into space. And so being particularly aware not to be right on the edge there. But now, you know, I could do something where I'm able to, you know, draw on the roof of this depending on how much of this I would want to fill in here. And then again, this is either there or not. But now I have, you know, this sketched thing that's, you know, positioned discreetly in 3D space on on this. And so you can combine these things as well. like the the fact that you can't do the edge. The better technique there is to if we want to have the edge um have a line on it for grease pencil is to use the grease pencil outline for that object. Right? And so if we were to come back to object mode, grab this uh shift a grease pencil and then not stroke but object line art. then we get that. Remember the object line art is only going to work from the view of the camera, right? And so in this case, it does really help if you go back and look through the camera or do this, right? And so now, as Alex showed us, now I'm always looking through the camera. So this is bad in that, you know, if I want to have my camera locked down from a spe persp certain perspective, it does that. But it's good in that, you know, we get to see the grease pencil outline lines at all times, right? Even if this is not there, I see it in render. There we go. There we go. and then each uh thing. So I would start labeling these. This is the cube outline. Um can have its own modifiers. And so for instance, like these handdrawn ones might be less consistent than the precise outlines, right? And so you can add noise here to this. Um but uh just because it is the actual bezier curves underneath the hood. Same sort of situation here where like adding subdivisions to just the default cube doesn't it adding noise to the default cube doesn't do what you think it would do, right? You need more subdivisions on the uh existing thing. Yeah. So subdivide before the noise. Uh and then there should be more noise strength thickness noise scale. There we go. That's better. Thank you. And so now that can get wobble wobbled. Um by default it's animating and you can turn that on and off. Yeah, there because this still affects this and there. So it makes those less precise depending on like what you're doing stylistically there. Okay. So number one, just drawing parallel limited usefulness unless you're using the orthographic views to place it somewhere. And you could use the orthographic views to place it somewhere and then just move it later as well because they're just objects that you could grab. Right? If I grab this one and I hit G, can move this entire thing around. Uh and then number three, which is really interesting. And so if I make another grease pencil object here uh under grease pencil stroke tab date. Um let's go to draw mode and stroke up here, right? So, drawing on geometry with surface stroke is kind of like connects to it projects into space onto kind of like hook onto a stroke that's there. So, this is kind of interesting in that you can let's make it a little bit bigger. Draw and then move and then draw. And it's projecting it the first you have to start the stroke kind of intersecting with the other strokes, but it's projecting from the camera view onto the stroke that's there. Sometimes better than others. Let's see. So you can make these connecting parts. That's going down. We want that of view. We want that lines. We want this at stroke target. I think it's just connecting to the other lines there. Yeah. So, this is really interesting in that you can sort of actually connect things in 3D space as long as you're starting the stroke overlapping with an existing thing, existing stroke of some kind. I really haven't seen anything else that does something like this. So, by moving the camera around, this is the closest and most elegant system for quoteunquote drawing in 3D that I've seen that works like this where you're able to actually, you know, because we're seeing it from this angle, connect something to something else and have it, you know, work for the most part. And then these could become other objects. So it's particularly for like treel like things. This is super useful, right? Because you can just sort of start from the trunk and branch out and that actually lines up for all of those different branches. Yeah. Yeah. The red the thick red lines definitely communicate that. And yeah, this is in the grease pencil stroke drawing. But um you can convert this convert to curve. and then it becomes real stuff, you know, like shaded geometry. So that was grease pencil to mesh back to curve seemed to be the easiest way to go about it. Cool. So, those sort of three techniques together um can get you most of what's going on there in that sort of you know deduce grease pencil style thing. If we look at like that uh like they have a like juice boxish looking tutorial thing. Um the Yeah. So, this is a good example here, right? So, grease pencil drawn onto the 3D object there. And then a lot of these are simple meshes or totally flat things that have um you know just grease pencil outlines on them. >> Yeah, >> this pill is definitely flat. I thought there was a pill that was one. Might be a different one. Those are flat for sure. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen a lot of people request that. I think there's got to be some issues there in terms of like what constitutes a closed stroke when we're in three dimensions, you know, like that that's not a, you know, it's not like a incredibly difficult technical problem. It's a difficult logical problem, right? In terms of like what are we doing here? Um, but like the uh",
    "transcript_segment": "exactly what you're talking about, right? Okay. Um let's save incremental on that over here. The so for our shot sizes right using one of the monsters for half of them and then the other one. Let's go ahead and do this deduce style grease pencil composition. So let's look at the grease pencil thing again real quick here. Um sort of So if I make a new grease pencil stroke behind the scenes, as far as I understand, the core of this is just like the curve stuff. And so you know, like to edit this, tab in, delete the existing points like you do with a curve. And then we can be in draw mode to draw. So the way I was thinking about organizing this um three draw I don't want to call them modes because we already already have modes. Three draw strategies for grease pencil. Uh one is draw parallel to camera. Two would be draw on geo. sometimes um keeping the original geo other times not and just you know using it as a uh you know canvas for lack of a better word right to organize the stuff in space right because all all of this is necessary because it's two-dimensional drawing right we the mouse or even if you're using the tablet it's still 2D right but we want to do it in 3D space. And so this is why this is necessary. Uh or three uh draw draw 2D in 3D space. Uh this is the one that's really is to my knowledge like unique to Blender, this mode here. The other ones are not really, you know, particularly technically amazing, but you know, super useful. Okay, so these three different ways to build out this, you know, 2D looking thing, but in 3D space, right? So number one, just drawing parallel to camera. And so if I'm in draw mode here and uh I'm just drawing this is all parallel to whatever the viewport is at this point right in space at some sort of specific distance. Uh the distance here uh by default is going to be the um origin of the scene. And so if I move this way and do it this way, you can see that all of these lines kind of end up pointing back to the origin here just because of the way, you know, the the plane that we're drawing on is very much like this plane, right? the one that's being visualized with the frost drum of the camera, right? And so it's like you're scribbling on that and that's where it sticks in space because the mouse is only giving it two-dimensional information that how far is it from the camera has to be manufactured some way via the system here. Um, so that's useful. And then you uh drawing in the orthographic views allows you to you know uh line things up in a way that would be useful. Oh, and just move the floor down. Right. So I can make something that's at a right angle to something else just by flipping the orthographic views there and lining it up because the orthographic view is two dimensional. And so this is all what was under number one there. Right? We're parallel to the view that we're currently looking at it with the come back. Select the grease pencil object. That gives me back draw mode which I can come back to here. And then drawing on something. And so switching it to a surface. And now this projects from the view onto whatever it hits first. And so this, you know, makes it really easy to do things something like this. You know, if I want to turn this into some sort of house, right, that sticks to the surface. And then later I can either choose to um you know keep this here or not. Right. And it has that. So not only I mean drawing on the front face there is obvious but then also um coming back to here back to here right I could continue to do whatever I would need to. I could tab back out and start to, you know, give myself more of a template when I would need it, especially if I'm not going to be using this seeing it in the view later. And so, uh, here, here, here, extrude, scale, right? Some sort of roof. Now I have more of a guide here to use. And so I could come back here to tab back out. Come back here to draw once I select the grease pencil object to here. And so now I have more of a by default it's always at 50% opacity. Seems like a weird setting. Right? And so now the only part where this gets dangerous is when you approach the silhouette of it, right? Because the projection technique breaks down and you get that where it just sort of like spews it back into space. And so being particularly aware not to be right on the edge there. But now, you know, I could do something where I'm able to, you know, draw on the roof of this depending on how much of this I would want to fill in here. And then again, this is either there or not. But now I have, you know, this sketched thing that's, you know, positioned discreetly in 3D space on on this. And so you can combine these things as well. like the the fact that you can't do the edge. The better technique there is to if we want to have the edge um have a line on it for grease pencil is to use the grease pencil outline for that object. Right? And so if we were to come back to object mode, grab this uh shift a grease pencil and then not stroke but object line art. then we get that. Remember the object line art is only going to work from the view of the camera, right? And so in this case, it does really help if you go back and look through the camera or do this, right?

So I would start labeling these. This is the cube outline. Um can have its own modifiers. And so for instance, like these handdrawn ones might be less consistent than the precise outlines, right?

    "search_text": "AVC240 October 15, 2025 Grease Pencil Scene Building Tutorial So like our vending machine here um and our you know our character that we used previously. How could we do these? Right? So, we're just sort of looking at this, thinking about what you would want to, you know, we're making your own version of this style thing, right? The main question as you're blocking out the scene is thinking about, you know, what do I want to be actual geometry and what do I want to be what can I make work flat, right? And for the most part, you know, thinking about things that would be curvy or rounded, you know, like people's bodies or these fish, like those are flat things that just stay to the camera. Whereas the more geometric stuff where you're going to get more parallaxing as the camera moves around, right? This this technique definitely limited by the camera movement. It's not like the camera move is going to work to whip around in all directions without a bunch of other work. But um really effective overall. And so like the basic shape of a lot of the layout of the area like we saw was you know geometry that then has this combination of the grease pencil edge effect plus these extra you know sort of defining lines built onto different things. Um, so yeah, let's see. How would we do like this like a vending machine like thing? And so if we brought this in and down and up, grab this one here and uh maybe scaled it in kind of like this. Uh, and then you insert I. Uh, that's too much. I There we go. And then, you know, the default insetss always come in the same on every side. But, you know, then you can adjust them as one would want here. So, in this case, something like this. And then, uh, E E. There we go. bring that in if you wanted to round specific corners. So, grabbing this edge perhaps and this edge perhaps, not I don't want to bevel the whole thing, but just do big like shape silhouette bevels here. And so grabbing the um bevel tool here and then rounding that a bit. And then depending what I would want to do here because this is going to stay pretty flat, you know, making sure it's not going to need to go into a subdurface, right? And so, um, you know, subdividing this face a couple times if you wanted to make shelves or something like that, you know, wouldn't be the world's best 3D modeling practice, but in this case would work. You could bevel this edge and this edge or do all these at the same time. Um, uh, then let's see what it would look like. Get rid of this. Save this file. Got the sunlight. add our outlines with our grease pencil object. Look through the camera. Then so part of what they were doing in theirs is some of the NPR shading. Have we done that here? We did it in We did it here. Okay. Right. So I mean the basic formula there come over to here here here and then our ramp. And instead of linear, I'm going to change this to go constant. So this gives me some of the hard lines. What is it? Control-click gives me a new node. Now I can have a separate crease pencil object if I wanted to draw some things on the shelf here. So shift a And we want to go up against the wall here, I guess. So, in here, let's go to edit, delete those points, and then back to draw. And um bring this down. And in this case, we want to go kind of onto the thing. And so this would be using the surface technique. We got stuff on the shelf. and now I could select these things and I come back to object mode. You know, these could be out more or wherever they would need to be on the scene. By default, they're not casting shadows, but And since this is already here with all the things attached, um you could get some more and this has our shader already set up. So you could get some more ground uh you know in terms of getting things done quickly coming in here and then shift a in the object. That gave me a separate cube that then I could use to you know model something else like that um pillar thing. And then if you tab back out of that that pillar is getting all the same stuff. if you don't need to set that up again or apply it in those ways. And so then tab back in remember here your control L is going to be your friend in terms of if you want to select it like an object here and then shift D. I give you a second one that you could use to set up the scene here. And then all of that is just working with the lights and you come back to here and you know rotate your sunlight and everything's copathetic. If I want to then you know draw on one of these things like the poster or the graffiti like it was in those scenes. Coming back to this one and coming back and putting the in draw mode. There we go. On to surface. And so And that's all sticking to that part of it. This one has its own thing over here. Maybe some of these lines to sort of work with the other lines to give it more of a look. Um, so there's the noisiness of the lines, right? Which is going to be in this. If we grab this and here, here have to be in object mode. So, especially with the solid shading that really breaks it out. Although some of these smaller places may be uh a little more noisy, you might be able to get around this by adjusting the underlying geometry, right? Because this line art is being generated from that. And so if we tab back out uh to this object and remeshed this Yeah. So the voxal remeshing here for the object itself kind of then makes the polygons equally distributed. So when you come back to here when you would decrease the subdivision you wouldn't have different results or less different results. Right? It should be evaluating this after. If you wanted to make more sure, you would just apply this um modifier there. But And then you could sketch your own 2D character to put in here for the shot sizes of your scene that matches, you know. So there's three options as I see it there. You could uh, you know, for putting the character in this 2D for 3D scene. You could, you know, draw, you know, in its own uh GP object. You could import um your own uh flat image. Or you could import um a mesh and then give it the um cell-shaded and grease pencil object um treatment just like these are in the space. Make sense? Cool. All right. So the task is going to",

So, it does a pretty reasonable job here quadwise. Um, some of our smaller things have gotten smooshed here. And like I said, at the end of the day, it needs to come into quad-based topology here. But if we look at it, right, there's a couple I think this is maybe a shy needs a little more topology detail here to represent what's happening here and the antenna. And so let's do one more back here. So I'll go to 4%. And then export and overwrite. If we overwrite, do we even need to update the Blender file? Let's see what happens. probably Yeah, I feel like that's a pretty good job. If we were to look at this and if we come in here, tab in and you know our mileage is going to vary here in terms of the topology. But you see it does you know a reasonable job of having edge loops around the extrusions, the things that you know we would label as extrusions. A reasonable job of the topology following the shape, right? The pretty much number one thing in our 3D modeling bible is we want the topology to follow the shape, right? Um, and so this is pretty good um, in terms of what we have here. Let's check out the UVs that it generated. And so if we were to look at this and grab all of them. Yeah. And so it definitely tries to lay everything out in the few fewest amount of seams across uh the entire thing. But depending on what you would want to do with the painting of this, let's look here. So this is one of the things especially with automatically generated um topology because a lot of times you have things like this like this edge loop starts to follow what we would think but then it doesn't hit a pole here and it continues over in that direction over this way. So yeah that's not not bad. The thing that we might want to do here in terms of like making it a little bit lighter from polycount is like do we need uh these faces here on the bottom? This is if this is going to be something that always attaches to the ship in this direction, right? And so you could certainly trim things up here with uh getting rid of some of those faces because it's uh substance painter is not going to let you do that. You can't have non-manifold things coming out of substance painter because of the way the the fields work. You can't have a hollow field, right? I mean, that makes sense after seeing the way every the way it plays out there, right? That doesn't it's not a thing. Uh so let's go to point mode and just get rid of some points there. And if we were to look at that now, maybe a little bit more. And yeah, not a super clean edge here, but this would be into the hull of the ship wherever it was attaching, right? And so it would end up looking something like something like so, right? So that would work out. The other the other adjustment we can make here is the weighted normal um modifier. And so if we were to dial this up and down here There we can see let's let's look at that. So this is, you know, now there's some options here instead of just, you know, shade smooth, shade flat, shade auto smooth here, smooth by angle. That's essentially what shade auto smooth does, you know. So this is another route here where we can sort of bring this in, but you can see the face is kind of popping in and out of smooth shading there.

Let's come back to model mode over here and look at some of the symmetry stuff. So, I'm just going to turn this layer off. And then how do I add a new thing? I make sure this is not selected. Right click and add a new base. And so, let's start with a end gun. There we see that gives us a second layer here to use as the primitive container. And let's bring this down. Let's maybe taper and cher the top of it kind of like so. And then maybe make it something that would be tough, right? So if we did like some sort of odd number like nine sides there. So we'll do something that's more radial here to do some of the symmetry. So that's pretty good. Let's go ahead and flatten the side of it. So, I'm going to right click and bring in a cube and then bring that down. And then use this to subtract from that to flatten that out in the bottom like so. The smoothness here can sort of round that edge. And then let's bring in a um sphere and bring that down. And then under symmetry. Um or no to make it radial symmetry. That's what they call repetition. There we go. So we want radial radial count. want to go nine like we did before. And so now if I were to move this, it does that, right? And then this can be added in here while this is still live. And we can again blend this to make it more right if we want it sharper than this. So making super super sharp edges is not really that, you know, like you're going to have issues exporting, right? That's Blender's thing. So doing things that have more of this rounded edge, especially for parts that we may be seeing from further away, like so. Um, and so, you know, a little bit of not making them cranked way down sharp here is going to allow for a little bit more graceful movement. Um, let's What was the one?

So, for instance, um make sure we're still on this layer here. [Music] And so here we could use the repetition axis. And so this is kind of like what we would think about in terms of regular symmetry. Although this thing is nine-sided, right? So maybe this isn't a great design decision here. Yeah. Doing it rather in a uh multiple of three is going to be something that's a little bit more interesting and lines up with the actual design. And let's subtract that out.

I wanted things to be beveled there and so I didn't have any like I think I had less hard hard edges than I had in the other one.

No, it didn't go quite to the end, but pretty fixable. Let's mark the seam there. So, taking these the whole way out. Weird. And let's make sure that that's okay. On the other side, same sort of thing. All right. So, each of these pieces gets cut off distinctly. Look at that. Careful. And then this one kind of wrapped around in a strange way, right? So I didn't get it quite symmetrical, but I mean just the fact it did as well as it did is notable. This is the kind of thing that people are pointing machine learning at in a way which I think will be super useful soon. in terms of the uh you know really usable. There we go. Okay. So, each of those pieces should be distinct now. Let's see how that works. So, if I look at everything and uh then a U unwrap. There we go. Uh we're getting some pretty That's these bottom part of the holes there. Depending on how you'd want to deal with those. Also, this gets spread out in a way that probably takes up a lot of space. And so perhaps connecting uh these across here would make a lot of sense. And so here to here. There's one. Here's probably a easier. And then over here. There we go. And one more time. A U. There we go. That gives us more space to lay things out. And we can also pack these islands once we have them selected. There we go. you guys following there on the live stream, right? So, laying these out flat as many pieces as I can. Um, yeah. So, we have good UVs here for this. It's um, you know, usable UVs. We don't have that bottom part taking up a huge chunk of space, right? You saw how big that was in the original UVs. It was like this big hole here. And yeah, like substance modeler doesn't know that that's the back side of the thing. And so rearranging all the texel uh UV space there allows us to take care of that in a pretty easy way. But yeah, I think the value proposition here is clear in terms of like how uh much freer you can be with especially this kind of like you know for this workflow that we're doing here right and this is um you know the in some painter it's referred to as like the primitives workflow in that all of these are you know booleaned from each other and they're all still live right And so this makes it really adjustable, right? In the way that you know the hard surface stuff modeled in Blender is definitely not as adjustable. Um, which is nice. But yeah, um, especially when automatic read topology takes another step forward, this will be um, super useful for sure. Awesome. Okay. Um, you guys have any questions?

And then we will export that. Does it keep our other settings? No. I suppose if we save the settings it would, but um yeah, let's go to 4% or three. Let's make it more adaptive. Make sure that we're over here on quads and that we are making an FBX and we wanted to generate UVs. And now we can export set access. Cool. And let's look at that over here. Yeah, that's not bad right out of the box there. Right, I did a lot of managing, right? I wanted things to be beveled there and so I didn't have any like I think I had less hard hard edges than I had in the other one. And so you see how that beveing, especially for parts that are going to be further away like this, really I mean it works in terms of like the lighting and design of the piece, but then also uh I think it really works from a modeling standpoint there. And so that works. Let's do the same thing uh in terms of cutting it. And so here, let's get the anchor point worked out. And so we'll come over here and do this to origin the bottom. And then we'll alt G this thing. There we go. And then we can cut that bottom out. Actually, we could do it with the carve tool here. Pretty easy. So this is part of boolean. If we were to uh destructive view getting some sort of Python error. Never mind. We'll just do it the other way. I don't know what that's about. Um, there we go. Let's bring this down like so. Go.

So, let's look at um just getting our base shape sort of figured out here with what we would want to uh model. So, uh, different parts of this coming together in different ways. If you were starting off with the airplane version of this, uh, blocking it out, I would probably start off with doing something that's going to end up being, um, in the mirror modifier to sort of keep everything together there. Right? So if we make a uh new uh cube and then immediately uh don't move the anchor point tab in and just set up some sort of base shape here. Maybe kind of like so. Bring this in and tab back out and immediately put on the uh mirror modifier on the Y in this case. And that gives us this.

And so here, grabbing different parts of it. Let's look at it from the top. And so if this were to come out and uh yeah, so bring this in and like so. And then uh perhaps this is being joined, right? And so this E sort of comes over here to the middle. Managing the middle in the mirror modifier. Our merge here allows us to do this. Sort of bring those middle parts together. And dragging that up allows that to get merged in a way that um is going to work here along the middle. We also want this bisect on, meaning it's going to cut off any overlap stuff over there. And so let's look at this with some of these and modeling it when it's the base shape when it's in this low poly state allows for some freedom. So for instance, we could look at some parts here. Let's go ahead and save this before we lose it. This is going to be save as 185. This is going to be space ship form. And this is where it's going to go in. And so now, let's see. Let's just see if the bull tools has an update or something. Why is this giving us this error?",

That's going to be something to uh work with over in Substance Painter. We can see how that's going to function later. So, let's look at um just getting our base shape sort of figured out here with what we would want to uh model. So, uh, different parts of this coming together in different ways. If you were starting off with the airplane version of this, uh, blocking it out, I would probably start off with doing something that's going to end up being, um, in the mirror modifier to sort of keep everything together there. Right? So if we make a uh new uh cube and then immediately uh don't move the anchor point tab in and just set up some sort of base shape here. Maybe kind of like so. Bring this in and tab back out and immediately put on the uh mirror modifier on the Y in this case. And that gives us this.

This you want to, you know, this is just a a balance of, you know, doing things that line up with the topology the way it is are, you know, easier to get rolling with. So if you tab in here and we're to look at this one, right? Everyone knows that all points, you know, we can inset and extrude in order to block things out and start to create more complex shapes. This stuff over here got pretty non planer. So let's move some of these a little bit. That extrusion is way too much. I don't like that. Right. So part of the extrusion not working here is like what extrude from which direction here? What direction is the normal? Right. So the non-planerness of this is part of the problem. And so let's bring this down. And let's see how we could break some of this up. So if we were to extrude here, again, not going up beyond that point where it overlaps on itself. And then if you did extrude up, one way to make it less um obvious is to then do something with the extrusion itself. And so if this gets ramped up on this side so it doesn't look completely the same on all ends, that's part of it. And then over here, perhaps layering that one in a little bit. And then over here, moving this in. And perhaps making this Oops. Let's line this up. So local normal, it's going to line it up along that instance. And if we're sticking to quadbased blockout here, that gives us a lot to work with. And so we want to keep the small details for the grebling and really think about the big forms here of this. So we're breaking that up this part at the end here. Again, trying to make things not look like they inherited from the cube. And so I'm doing a lot of just deciding in what kind of space do I want to move these things? And if I do want to create a rounded edge anywhere, there needs to be a big sort of functional rounded edge, not like your just regular hard surface bevel, right? These would all be bevels at this point during the blockout that would want to have happen uh using the bevel tool, right? And so some sort of much more substantial look to that. That's going to end up being changing the silhouette of the of the shape itself. I like this on the back but not on the side. I'm just going to go back. And so here I'm going to grab these two and insert and then extrude out like so. And then because it's isolated like that, grabbing this and then beveling is a more a useful way to go about sort of laying that into the ship there. You can see how the mirror modifier really is my friend in this instance. Let's grab this and this. And so I extruded, you know, I did an inset here on this one. Now I can sort of break up the shape by, you know, doing an inset across these two here as a way to sort of, you know, not do the exact same part of it being inset. So like this. And then I could scale this down. So, I want to make sure that these stay lined up. And so, in this case, I'm going to go ahead and grab this top edge here. And we want to slide this. And so, the slide sort of moves it up and down on the face, right? Scaling it in there started to distort it. Whereas over here, I want it to remain on the face there. So, edge slide. And then that brings me into where I'm just moving the mouse. And then I click. There we go. And so that gives me an inset that is still uh planer, right? So co-planer with what was there before. And then this could be extruded out like so. And then here again, maybe doing something to the front to break up this shape here and here. And moving this in. And then grabbing this and moving it back. And then maybe I want something coming out of the front here. That seems like a grealable place for me. But because we've kept this pretty consistent here, you know, this edge here could possibly be a bevel candidate with the bevel tool. Right. So again, not tiny edge bevels. These are larger, you know, rounding areas there. And because we're in space, right? I mean, you want to have interest from all sides, right? So the bottom what what is the bottom in space, right? Uh, and so over here, maybe the whole way around. This has an inset. And maybe I slide this edge in. So, edge slide. And like so. There we go. And now here, here, and here. And this could be, you know, one of these things. We extrude. Then we insert again. And extrude. And then perhaps grab this front part here. And I'm going to move those up. GZ and this face here which is totally flat. And so let's make this a little bit more lined up with the mirror modifier. And so I can look at it from straight on. And I can altclick this loop here by doing this. Let's just do it this way. And we can scale these in to straighten them out and just make it a little bit easier so we know how it's going to react in the mirror modifier there. And those are welded together because I did want to do something to this face here. and then grabbing this to keep it planer. If we want to keep it planer, we have can't move it. We need well, we can't move it if we if we set this to normal. That should be lined up with the normal direction of it. And so that's kind of like sliding. In most instances, I think that would work. Although maybe not all. I'd have to think about it. Um and then this could come out here depending on how big the welding is here. There we go. Keep that a little bit separate. And again, trying to avoid cubeish areas, right? So, let's do something with these that give it a little bit more of a distinct profile. Unless you're modeling a Borg ship and don't do that. Okay, let's save that. And this will be ship one. And I'm going to just, you know, shift D this um control crl + V. So that um I can come back to that if I want to because we want to convert this into a object, singular object. And so we want to make sure the meshing along the middle here is working with the mirror modifier. So uh convert to mesh. There we go. Um then uh we want to [Music] the bevel depending on how adventurous you got should be able to work for you here. Although we want to keep it pretty minimal. So, we do definitely do want the harden normals on. That works. And if it's on smooth shading, you see that brings us a lot of what we want in our base shape here. Now, at this point, um, actually, before I apply this for even if you're doing the spaceship, the the, you know, more of a winged shape thing, um, I think having some degree of asymmetry is just more interesting spaceship design here.

And so it's a little bit of depending on how you far you drug some of these angles. And so at this point, one of the ways to do some asymmetry would be possibly a boolean, right? And so that's doable depending on um you know if you're putting it directly in a face or in some sort of minimal amount of um as long as it's not interacting with a lot of the angled parts of the geometry, you can end up with something that could work. So let's go ahead and see if we can find a boolean design that we like. that's going to also work from a um topology standpoint. There we go. And I'm gonna just take care of this a little bit before I even do the cut. And so maybe this isn't the whole thing. It's just over here. And then also over here, I want this edge. So tab in here. And then look at this from the top. And straighten this out so it's on that plane there. And then uh subtract uh this from that. Controll minus. There we go. Cuts that out. And so let's look and see how that looks. That's useful. Let's see. We can move this up. Oops. Just the cube. And in our ship itself, remember, we want to move this up above the bevel there so that this all gets into the bevel. And then, for instance, with this, be nice to round that there. And so that's a matter of beveing this edge. So in here with the bevel tool about there and depending on how rounded you would want that to be. too many and I'll start to run into some of the other geometry there. So about about like that. So that gives us a little bit of asymmetry and maybe there's some on the other side. So might be able to use There we go. Let's look at it from the top. I don't know. There's no other circular parts of this, so I don't like that quite as much. Let's do this over here. Let's make it a little asymmetrical on that side. And subtract this from here. Oops. There we go. That's the one I wanted. And again, reorder this modifier stack. Putting this above over here. And then this one, I think, is the one that should get rounded here. So, let's select this one and tab in. And then grab this edge here and run a bevel on that. Again, just trying not to run over the other geometry there. Cool. All right. So, that gives me like, you know, fundamentally symmetrical design, but some level of asymmetry there. And our main bevel that's sort of doing our rounded edge is fairly tight. If we come back in, right, it's not something like really large. In fact, the way it's sort of designed now, it can't be all that big. Uh, okay. So, do I want to The bevel's working, but I probably don't want to apply it right now. I want to be able to UV unwrap this first. And so, let's just, you know, we were checking in there. And I do want to apply these. But before I do that, uh, I'm going to just control Crl + V again. and then turn this one off. Right? Just keeping a record of everything I'm doing there in case I need to go back at any point. And so on um this one, in fact, I would want to let's put this in its own um collection. And so I'm going to right click and say new collection. This will be um boolean symmetry. And so I'll uh control crl +v all of that and sort of store that over there in case I need to get back to it. And then this one I can convert to mesh. and shade flat for now. And then get rid of the cutters because I have the cutters stored in the backup over there. And let's do another save incremental. And at this point now, we can do uh unwrap on this. And so let's come in here uh tab in and grab everything. And especially with the spaceship here, it's worth a go. Uh, we want our different panels selected here. So, let's come in and let's look at some options. So, I'm going to come into here into the UV mode and um, let's see what the automatic UV unwrapping gives us. The smart UV project. So that really lays everything out flat, but because of our U shape, we get this whole business here. So, um, let's let's look here and break some different pieces off. So I think this might be good to do with the sort of interactive projection thing. So turning on the select here coming over to here and live unwrap. And if we start to mark seams there, we get it automatically updating. And so we don't have to keep hitting mark seam or every time we mark seam it, you know, does the update. Actually, one thing we can do here, the smart UV project wasn't quite it. Let's come let's before we do this, let's get try one other more automatic thing. Let's uh grab all of them and clear the seams. And then we are going to come in here and uh select sharp. So select sharp edges gives us the areas that are sharp shaded. Then you can go ahead and mark all of those as seams to automatically unwrap all of those into like separate islands there. And that looks pretty good. There may be some parts that Let's see here. Using our um UV toolkit will be advantageous here. Let's pack these. I don't know why I want to keep things together. These longer ones here. Where is this? So, I'm going to turn this back on over there. Let's see. Is there anything weird here? No, we're 111. Okay. Nothing strange. Um, I think in my case, just adding another seam here going around to break up some of this would work. For whatever reason, this isn't connected there. So just going to knife cut right there. Now that should select the whole way around. And let's mark that as a scene. That's better. And then over here, same thing. Oh, that's not marked as a seam because that's where I did the boolean on the other side. The boolean didn't interact with this part over here. And so, let's mark that as a seam there. There we go. You see how that opened everything up immediately. Much better. All right. All right. So now we're seeing relatively similar density across the surface of this, which is what we want over here. Okay. So things like this you want to look out for, right? We want those to be separated out. And so you can also investigate it over here when you're looking around on the map. Turning on the select here. And remember, I haven't applied the bevel yet. We're going to do that thing where we apply the bevel on the export so that the UVs just kind of automatically update there. Okay, nice. Let's apply the bevel again and get rid of the checker material and tab out shade smooth. Make sure we do the harden normals. There we go. And just a little bit of beveling there.

SketchFab is one of the biggest online 3D model repositories. Uh now owned by um Unreal Engine and Epic. Uh so it's to some extent getting integrated into what they're just calling Fab now, but Sketch Fab still stands on its own and everything's, you know, for the time being still there. And um some of it's available to download, some of it's not available to download, but that's not the important part for us. The important part for us right now is there's a lot of um there's a lot to be looked at here in terms of the way the model is structured, right? And so you're like, okay, well this, you know, rhino character here looks like an achievable shape, but um if you select this, you get uh a way to look at the model completely online without even having to load it into Blender. And so the important ones here are wireframe. And so you can see like what is the actual mesh look like compared to the texture. And so this, you know, this character here extremely well optimized designed for, you know, some sort of much faster real-time game environment, right? We have a pretty low uh polyc count here all around. Um, and that serves a couple purposes. Again, the performant one, then also there's less to wrangle here in terms of, you know, without a whole bunch of more 3D modeling experience. This means that you're adding detail in the texture. And you can see how much extra gets added here, right? And so a lot of those smaller details I was referring to are things like in fact I can just zoom in here right. So like this if we look at the wireframe totally not pleasant present in the model itself. This is something that is in the material. Uh same with the ropes right um and the belt. the things that stick out are the things that are um need to be in the actual shape. And so over here, the belt buckle has an extrusion there, whereas the rest of the belt very minor. And this kind of form fitting armor, right? This kind of thing. a pretty simple extruded shape, right? This is already part of the top and so then then that was just extruded out. Um and then these things sort of separate shapes that were put on there. So the entire model doesn't need to be one totally continuous joined mesh. um there can be these extra parts that are part of the mesh object and uh get mapped into the rigging and everything else with with the same object that gets mapped onto the bones when we see a version of that here.",

We're gonna it's just going to be uh there's a couple different ways to go about doing this and we'll look at some automatic ways in Blender and then some automatic ways in Substance Painter in terms of bringing it in. And then here, right, if the character has something it's carrying around, having that be separate is the best idea because that doesn't the objects that the character is carrying don't you typically don't want those in the character object for the rigging process. uh you only want uh the character itself there because these don't want to get deformed by the character bones.

Now parts that are up here, right? So, we saw this with um the bottom part of the you know, whatever uh clothing that rhino character was wearing. And then up here at the top, stop making noise, please. Right here. So in a lot of cases, ears, especially cat ears, toughs of hair, things like this, this is in the the edge or silhouette is being controlled in the texture, right? And so the alpha channel is masking what's going on here in order to keep think about representing this shape in the topology of what's going on with the mesh. In order to represent this shape here in the mesh, this would all need to be much much higher subdivision than what the rest of this character is in terms of like topological density here. Um, and so the decision to just simply model enough space to capture what it is that you want sticking out there and then use the alpha channel here in order to define that tiny part. Right? So this is in that Rhino character. It was like the loin cloth it had on was the same sort of thing. It was a, you know, four or five faces that kind of looked like this. And then the tattered clothing was all in the material there, right? And the this was essentially masked out with the alpha channel, right? And so the alpha channel, the mask channel, it's the one that allows you to block out different parts of it. And so that allows this whole character to be much much lower poly. They also did it here like on the, you know, kirchief or whatever this is on it. And then this is a clever way to do eyes like as buttons on this sort of voodoo doll character. This is yeah like a good job here modeling super low poly version of this but um again you wouldn't want to have this in the process while you're doing the modeling and the riggering rigging and the texturing again add that later.

Um, and then we need to think about what we're going to do in terms of the appendages here at first. And so let's look at that. Um, having it in wireframe mode allows you to select through, which is, uh, a big gotcha here at the beginning in order to just sort of start to figure out the shape of the object. Right? So, we want the bottom. We need this a little bit tapered more here at the top.

And that's going to make sure that then in your process, you're able to use control R, which is a super important one, loop cut. Right? So loop cut is going to allow you to precisely add topology, right? So I just need a little bit extra here. And if you're using loop cut and it actually works, meaning it finds a loop around your object, that means almost in most cases that you're going to creating an extra cut, but the resulting topology will still be predominantly or completely quads, which makes all of the modeling tools much more much easier, low friction process. The other way to add more topology is just simply to subdivide the entire mesh. And I would use this sparingly because then the more mesh you've got, the more complicated it becomes, right? And so we have loop cut here and we're going to need something to get the arm out there. So, control R click allows me to go into this mode here. And just trying to see where like where the armpit would be like right in there. And so that's going to give me the extra topology I need probably to bring the arm out because remember we want the arm going straight out. And then here we have stuff at the bottom.

And a lot of times when I'm actually doing, you know, I'm looking around figuring out what to do. And then in Blender especially, I come back to the orthographic views with my numpad in order to make the actual changes. And so here I can move these down, scale this, scale this this way. There we go. And something there. And then E again for extrude. E for extrude is going to work perfectly fine in this case because I'm just going down in one direction. We look at this here and here. Can bring this way in and probably here. So, alt R is going to loop select around. And so again, if you're maintaining all of those um loops by not haphazardly adding extra geometry, it makes everything a little bit easier to take care of here. And then down here, probably a little bit of some kind of foot. So let's bring this down. Let's scale this a little bit more flat. And then again maintaining the quad topology gives you a flat face here at the front which you can sort of extrude out to make some footish shape shoeish shape. And then we have something like that for now. I'm not worrying about the detail. I just want to get the general shape here and up here. So, let's go ahead and get an arm out of here. And so, we don't have as much guidance. It's sort of in this way. I suppose I could flip the image, but let's just look at it this way. Uh, same thing. And so, we can go uh E. And this comes out in the direction of the normal. And so, it's straight out. And we can bring this in and down. trying to use the gizmos when I'm in uh orthographic mode, right? when I've hit one of the one three seven9 or I'm using this to flip around and we'll come out here and down and out again and down and then similar kind of situation where for the hand or paw itself in this case this is kind of indented here and so now in point mode. I could grab these points here and here and here and here and then here at the end here and here. Um, let's bring these down. Scaling down, scaling in kind of for the wrist. Whenever I'm using the gizmo, I'm making sure to just grab one of the handles at a time, only manipulating in one direction. And then E out one more time. And so you may have noticed you can extrude twice or extrude and then loop cut. So for instance, I know I'm going to need uh well, I don't know if I need it, right? I could have a thumb here or not, right? Just depends how anthropomorphized this dog is. But um in this case, we'll do that because a lot of other characters have thumbs. We've talked before about um yeah, the more fingers you've got in thumbs, the greater the amount of detail and complexities when it gets down. I mean, everyone knows this from life drawing class, right? Drawing hands, just representing the complexity of the human hand and the human foot, you know, it tough, right? Master level um kind of things. And so a little bit here for where we'll get a thumb and then there we go. And then again for the end of the hand. And so just like the foot there, this gives you room then to extrude this out for thumb then at that point. And notice again we've got all quads everywhere. Now it does look really blocky, right? And so there's two things that are going to happen eventually. This will be shade smoothed. So even for a low poly model you see that gives us a good amount of smoothing. However um in terms of rigging this model this amount of topology I would write this down. This is too low. Okay so it is possible to be too stingy here. Right for the most part I mean a few of you have taken a bunch of other classes. Most of you don't know enough to be dangerous in terms of creating too much topology here, right? So, um being super you want to be efficient here, but we are going to run a subdivide on the whole mesh certainly before we send it over to the rigging stage there to make sure that that um works.",
    "transcript_segment": "at the bottom. We need to go back here. And a lot of times when I'm actually doing, you know, I'm looking around figuring out what to do. And then in Blender especially, I come back to the orthographic views with my numpad in order to make the actual changes. And so here I can move these down, scale this, scale this this way. There we go. And something there. And then E again for extrude. E for extrude is going to work perfectly fine in this case because I'm just going down in one direction. We look at this here and here. Can bring this way in and probably here. So, alt R is going to loop select around. And so again, if you're maintaining all of those um loops by not haphazardly adding extra geometry, it makes everything a little bit easier to take care of here. And then down here, probably a little bit of some kind of foot. So let's bring this down. Let's scale this a little bit more flat. And then again maintaining the quad topology gives you a flat face here at the front which you can sort of extrude out to make some footish shape shoeish shape. And then we have something like that for now. I'm not worrying about the detail. I just want to get the general shape here and up here. So, let's go ahead and get an arm out of here. And so, we don't have as much guidance. It's sort of in this way. I suppose I could flip the image, but let's just look at it this way. Uh, same thing. And so, we can go uh E. And this comes out in the direction of the normal. And so, it's straight out. And we can bring this in and down. trying to use the gizmos when I'm in uh orthographic mode, right? when I've hit one of the one three seven9 or I'm using this to flip around and we'll come out here and down and out again and down and then similar kind of situation where for the hand or paw itself in this case this is kind of indented here and so now in point mode. I could grab these points here and here and here and here and then here at the end here and here. Um, let's bring these down. Scaling down, scaling in kind of for the wrist.

Um, that pretty much goes for even if we're doing high poly sculpting here. But when we want to make the arm, you can't you shouldn't pull that out in the sculpting view.

Going from a part of the mesh that's really, really detailed to a part of the mesh that's not detailed and having them all be continuous connected faces.

Lily, can you give me a heads up thumbs up there that you're hearing all this? I mean, I assume you are. You would have said something at this point, but just appease my paranoia.

And so, we may want to do something a little more precise here. And so I'm going to control R. And then this would allow me to cut once. You know, this is dividing in half. The other thing you can do is control R mouse over and then before you press anything, use your scroll wheel to have multiple cuts across. Right. Thank you. And then I can The reason I want thirds here is so I can extrude the snout. Right. Right. If I just subdivide once, get a line down the middle, just right where the snout is, right? And I want to have the snout come out here. And so I can click there. Now remember, you click once, you still have not cut. It lets you slide the cuts. And so I usually just click. Usually I'm not sliding them. Most of the time I just click click again. And so if you see me do it quickly, it's like that. Um, and now we have the kind of topology that we want to go forward with this. Um but probably want a little bit more topology on the side. So controlr here. Um and probably here. Okay. And so this gives me some of what I want here to pull this shape out. So E starts to give me some of what I want. And now I can grab some points to start moving things around. Come up here. Alt click. If it's not finding the whole way around, I'm alt click and then I'm holding down shift. Shift altclick. Shift altclick and then scaling down in that direction. and we could start to let's get it a little bit closer and then go into sculpt mode. The um slash tool here could be useful depending on how much of a neck the neck kind of runs into the neck scruff here.

Let's get the head in here and block that out. So, let's go ahead and save. I'm going to start as a separate object and then combine them later for that one. And so, we'll call this just body now. And then back in object mode here, let's shift A and make another cube. And bring this up. And then let's tab in here. And scale this down. knowing that we want some overlap here. And let's subdivide this. So, right click and say, subdivide. Um, actually, you know what? We want the snout to be able to come out of this, right? And so, we may want to do something a little more precise here. And so I'm going to control R. And then this would allow me to cut once. You know, this is dividing in half. The other thing you can do is control R mouse over and then before you press anything, use your scroll wheel to have multiple cuts across. Right. Thank you. And then I can The reason I want thirds here is so I can extrude the snout. Right. Right. If I just subdivide once, get a line down the middle, just right where the snout is, right? And I want to have the snout come out here. And so I can click there. Now remember, you click once, you still have not cut. It lets you slide the cuts. And so I usually just click. Usually I'm not sliding them. Most of the time I just click click again. And so if you see me do it quickly, it's like that. Um, and now we have the kind of topology that we want to go forward with this. Um but probably want a little bit more topology on the side. So controlr here. Um and probably here. Okay. And so this gives me some of what I want here to pull this shape out. So E starts to give me some of what I want. And now I can grab some points to start moving things around. Come up here. Alt click. If it's not finding the whole way around, I'm alt click and then I'm holding down shift. Shift altclick. Shift altclick and then scaling down in that direction. and we could start to let's get it a little bit closer and then go into sculpt mode. The um slash tool here could be useful depending on how much of a neck the neck kind of runs into the neck scruff here. But you could uh bevel this edge to create a little bit more topology there and extrude this E down. Create some neck area. And then let's put a subdivision surface on this. Right?

    "search_text": "AVC200 October 13, 2025 Ear Modeling with Planes Let's save that. Let's look at how we do the ear. Right. So, let's call this head for now. So, I've got body and head. And so for the ear, we want this floppy ear. Um, I'm going to say we'll be able to get most of it in the shape here. And then use the alpha channel a little bit for the ear shape. And so let's tab out here um to object mode back over here. We're going to start with a plane in this case and tab. Then move this up and rotate into ear area. Scale this down and then subdivide. And again, rather than subdividing again right off the bat, I'm just going to start to move some points around to get these where I would want. And then I'm probably going to subdivide again. right? Knowing that this part here is probably going to be covered up by the hat. And so the ears are so big and floppy that they're kind of part of the silhouette here, right? And so this level of low polyiness isn't going to work with the character because it's going to look very blocky, right? And so we are going to need to run another subdivide here. But I want it to be rounded out. And so if I want it to be rounded out, I need to do the subdivision surface, right? Why is the subdivision surface different than just running the subdivine command? Because of this. Okay, the subdivision surface has the Catmol Clark algorithm. The cat mccclark algorithm is the thing that's rounding out as it subdivides. Right? Just simple subdivision is just this. Just draw a line. Just draw a line and keep the actual face the same shape. The Catm Clark draws a line and draws a line subdividing, but it's then rounding out the overall actual silhouette of the shape by doing that. And so we can do that. and then apply it by just convert to mesh. And that gives us more faces. And now we're somewhere close. And so now if we want this to um tab and work with some of the points here again moving the existing points around versus creating new points. Only creating new points with the control R loop cut or the subdivide means that I'm keeping everything mostly quads which will be advantageous for UV unwrapping advantageous for rigging all the later parts of it. Um now the other like the do we want this to have some thickness? Right. Um in this case with this ear because it's so prominent. If we wanted to stick out a little bit more depending on what we're doing here. If we were to grab this and probably adjust the anchor point of it for now. N tools origins up over and get rid of that if it's going to be this prominent right where we would see this from the inside depending on where we are I would say yes having a little bit of thickness here is not going to be uh that problematic, right? It's maybe slightly a slightly more prominent part of the silhouette than the um uh than those toughs of hair we saw on that voodoo looking character, right? Um and so in that case, that's fairly easy, right? Notice I modeled it with a plane. Less points to move around, right? Um the two on my list of modifiers I would be writing down in my notes, um would be, you know, our subdurface, remember the catmill clark is going to be the thing that actually rounds things out. And then our solidify. This is going to take a plane and give it thickness. Right? So it's really handy for these kind of things. I model the ear with a plane and then I'm able to pull it out to make it thick. You know, give it both sides right here. So look for solidify. Not that one. This one. There we go. And thickness here. You can see what this does. Essentially, it's like it's extruding it out, right? Um, be careful not to go negative here because that's going to turn your thing inside out, which we don't want. But yeah, I would say with this ear, yeah, it probably wants to have some thickness, right?

And so, let's go to our um I'm going to go and save incremental. You want to be doing this throughout the entire process so that if things go really wrong, you can go back to previous versions. So save incremental here. And now let's make this part of the character symmetrical. And so we need to what's going to be involved here, right? Um we'll do this later with the one coming out of substance modeler. So make symmetrical. Um the main thing here is going to be the mirror modifier. But in the mirror modifier, there's two main parameters. It's going to be the weld distance here, which is going to fuse things together. And then we we have things that are over the line, the other half of the character. We're going to cut those away so that we flip half the character over cleanly to get an exact copy. And so the weld distance here and then clearly the mirror plane is going to be the main things we want to look at. But before this, we want to run this on the whole thing together. And so you may need to combine multiple objects like I have here. Right? So I've got the ears are separate, the head is a separate, and the body is a separate. I'm going to need to join those. What's the shortcut for join? >> Yes. And so before we join objects control J. Yes. [Music] So do you have a question? >> Oh okay. All right. So again before I did this before I take it a separate step I'm always saving incremental so I can go back to that step if I need to. So click, click, click, controll J. Boom. Everything gets smooshed into this one um object. And so I can put a single modifier on this and affect all of the stuff I just did, right? And in this case, this modifier, we've got the subdivision surface here, which uh actually before we do that, the let's look at this. The body has a subdurface on. So I can I control Z back a step here. The ear has the solidify and the head doesn't have anything. Okay? And so we want to apply the modifiers before we do that to not create a bunch of additional geometry haphazardly here. So I'll right click and say convert to mesh. There we go.

No modifiers here. No modifiers here. Now we will join control J and the resulting topology will be exactly as it was before. Okay. Um as opposed to before uh when I the first time I did it it was applying the subd to the other parts. So now we need to come in here and label this uh dog and then add the mirror modifier. And we get uh an atrocity here, right? So those of you doing horror games, this might be part of the workflow, but we want to modify. We want to mirror on which axis here? >> Uh yeah, we're going back and forth on the Y here. Remember, you can do multiple ones. Okay, so we're getting it's getting worse, not getting better. And part of the reason here is that the mirror modifier, the part that I think students have a hard time groing here is that mirror depends on the object origin, right?

And so let's look at it from the orthographic view. Anytime you're adjusting an anchor point, you want to be in the orthographic view. So you can do it with some degree of precision. Um, then let's come in here and let's get this correctly set up. I might put my snapping on to grid. Um assuming that the rest of it is reasonable um reasonably lined up with the grid. Uh good. Okay. So now if I were to mirror on the Y and see is this at a weird angle? >> Yeah. And so we are going to go back to local here. And I'm still in the origin. So if I alt R, it doesn't do it for me. And so let's look at it from the top and get this anchor point. You probably won't have to deal with this because it'll be properly set up or at least probably hopefully not rotated. There we go. And so that's that's looking kind of like what we want. But we see that there's some weirdness up here. And if we look at the um X-ray view, you'll see that uh things are being uh it's mirroring the entire thing and it's not bicting it. And so in this case, we want to set that up. I'm gonna turn this off for now. All right. So that stuff that was over the line, we want that stuff cut off. Um, it won't show us that unless we have the first one selected. And so you want your character oriented like this. So if it hasn't been oriented like this or you made a mistake at the very beginning, we want it facing forward in the X direction in the Y going back and forth. And so your anchor point here is an opportunity. Your mirror part here is an opportunity to get that fixed. And so ideally you'll have this, right? And so now it's doing what we wanted except it's taking the part that we don't want and flipping it over, right? And so that's what this last parameter is here, right? Because you could mirror either way. You could mirror this side on the other side or you could mirror this side on the other side, right? And so if it does, if it's not what you want, you just have to tell it to flip it to the other side there. And so now the thing I want you to understand is difference between this and this. Right? It's that when I have bict turned on, it's cutting off all the stuff that was on the other side. When I have bisect off, it's not cutting that off and it's flipping all of that stuff over as well. And so we have all this overlapping junk inside of the object. And so unless you were in the modeling phase and you only modeled stuff that was on one side of the line very cleanly, you're going to need to have the bisect on. So that that is there. Everybody with me there? Okay. Good. All right. So there's that. Um now the merge and so the merge part here is taking the things that are let's say like any human being you haven't lined up each vertex that's bicting your object exactly with the anchor point. If I were to turn off merge here, I mean, I just did a really good job, but um like you would a lot of times see a a tear open up in this either here, I'll try to tab in and move this vertex, turn off snapping way out, and then tab back up. And you can sort of see what it's doing there. Right? So now this um if I turn this up, it starts to fuse more of the stuff together in the middle. And so if it's too low, chances are you may see holes along the middle. That's a sign that you need to turn this up. Definitely holding shift so that you do it slightly. If it's too high, you start to get this where it's flattened parts of it by grabbing things that were a much larger distance from the bisecting line of the object and welded merged them together and giving you these flat areas. And so you absolutely don't want this, right? This is not this is not good for rigging or any part of this, right? And so the your problem if you've done a better job being custodian of the vertices while you're modeling, you shouldn't have too much to worry about here. Um if if you if your answer to both of those questions is I can't find a value that works here, right? there's some value at which things are there's still a hole and then there's still parts of my object getting flattened out. You want to decrease this so that you're not getting parts of it getting flattened like this. And then if there's still a hole, that means you need to move those vertices closer to the middle. Right? So there's not there's not anything you can do here. you need to come in and actually adjust some of your points to make that",

And so if it's too low, chances are you may see holes along the middle. That's a sign that you need to turn this up. Definitely holding shift so that you do it slightly. If it's too high, you start to get this where it's flattened parts of it by grabbing things that were a much larger distance from the bisecting line of the object and welded merged them together and giving you these flat areas. And so you absolutely don't want this, right? This is not this is not good for rigging or any part of this, right? And so the your problem if you've done a better job being custodian of the vertices while you're modeling, you shouldn't have too much to worry about here. Um if if you if your answer to both of those questions is I can't find a value that works here, right? there's some value at which things are there's still a hole and then there's still parts of my object getting flattened out. You want to decrease this so that you're not getting parts of it getting flattened like this. And then if there's still a hole, that means you need to move those vertices closer to the middle. Right? So there's not there's not anything you can do here. you need to come in and actually adjust some of your points to make that"

And so if you bring yours over and you had a bunch of materials on it in Blender, delete those before bringing it over. You want to have just have one material here. Okay. Ideally, you know, have a name on it that works, but just anything works. Okay. Baking the mesh maps. Texture set. Scroll down. Bake mesh maps or this nice new croissant inspired icon. Um, you can just click on that. That takes you to the baking view. We don't need to get into any of this. You can just jam this button here at the bottom. Okay. And so this will it's taking a bunch of information about the mesh and saving it in textures. And you'll notice that right away your model looks better. What is what looks better is that now it has ambient occlusion. There's darkening in the areas where there's crevices. And so that should immediately appear, you know, somewhat better. The navigation in Substance Painter is the Unity navigation, not the Blender navigation. So it's all the alt uh buttons.

That's certainly enough for things that are going to be more um detailed perhaps, then 4096 might be um called for. But again, the great thing about Substance Painter is that making that um change is just a matter of uh changing the export size here. And so that can be done later.

This allows us to allows Substance Painter to work as well as it's going to work. The other thing we want to make sure here is that we just have one material up here. Okay? And so if you bring yours over and you had a bunch of materials on it in Blender, delete those before bringing it over. You want to have just have one material here. Okay. Ideally, you know, have a name on it that works, but just anything works. Okay. Baking the mesh maps. Texture set. Scroll down. Bake mesh maps or this nice new croissant inspired icon. Um, you can just click on that. That takes you to the baking view. We don't need to get into any of this. You can just jam this button here at the bottom. Okay. And so this will it's taking a bunch of information about the mesh and saving it in textures. And you'll notice that right away your model looks better. What is what looks better is that now it has ambient occlusion. There's darkening in the areas where there's crevices. And so that should immediately appear, you know, somewhat better. The navigation in Substance Painter is the Unity navigation, not the Blender navigation. So it's all the alt uh buttons. And once this is done, you can just return to painting mode. >> Yes. >> What size was the textures again? >> Uh we did 2048, >> right? Um, that should be good, especially for anything that's remotely like Lily's design here where, you know, it's not totally tunelike, but cartoonish. That's certainly enough for things that are going to be more um detailed perhaps, then 4096 might be um called for. But again, the great thing about Substance Painter is that making that um change is just a matter of uh changing the export size here. And so that can be done later. It's part of the reason it's you know this is one part of Blender which doesn't really you know there's not really an equivalent yet for doing this kind of thing. So"

And we can color pick this the roughness here. If we want this to look flatter, especially while we're working on it, I'm going to just drag this up for now. Um, it still has lighting here, but we're we'll get a flat. Don't worry too much. We just want to get the color on the model here, right? That's the main things. And so, we've got that. Okay. So, this is the base color for our whole dog. Maybe it's a little darker because of where I color picked it. And so I'll take the value here and turn that down a little bit. And then I can use the paint layers to paint on top. And so I'll make a new paint layer here. And this will be the white. And so separating more things out into more layers is gives you more control just like Photoshop, right? The more stuff you jam on the one layer, the more cumbersome it becomes. And so here I want to paint this belly color. And there's a bunch of different brushes, but we don't really need to get into all that. But it allows me to paint the area I would want. The brush controls here that may be useful are smoothing. They call it lazy mouse. And so that allows you to especially if you are using a mouse and not a a pad of some kind, it makes it much uh gives you way less of that mouse jitter. Um the other thing is adjusting the size of the brush obviously would help here and the two main brushes just like any program. The default hard brush and the default soft brush are going to be the main two main workh horses. And so if I want a clean line here, I'm going to go to the hard brush and paint that in. I could also again use symmetry up here. And so I turn on symmetrical painting and make sure that we are symmetrical on the in this case. No, that's going on front and back. I think we want to mirror on the Y. No, Z in this case. There we go. So now I'm able to easily paint said detail. If we come back and look at the texture, right? And so this part is all white as well, right? Um so I could come in here and paint it like this, but I wouldn't advise you to do that. Um, we can make a mask on another fill. And so if I make another fill here and then right click and say add black mask, let's get this fill layer and color pick the same color. And then on the mask, instead of selecting this by hand by painting, I'm going to come over here to the select based on the geometry. And so I can use either mesh or polygon fill. I'm going to grab mesh. And since this is a separate discrete mesh, allows me to easily click on that object and come back and get this closer to what I would want. It looks a little bit different because of the roughness value. And then let's stay away from the eyes in case we want to animate the eye. We're going to want that as a separate thing that we can bring in. But let's look at two different options here just real quick to get the layers on. And so here around the snout and the mouth. And so this layer, this is, you know, paint white. And coming back to this one, actually, let's turn the symmetry back on for that. And then we're going to need another paint layer. And this is going to be the paint black. And so we can come in here and again come down and change the color that we're painting and scale this way down. We have our darker brown. And so another paint layer. We'll call this paint. Again, I'm trying to label paint and fill. And so this is paint dark brown. And we can again grab this and this up. I have symmetry on. I do. Right. So, the paint layers aren't as um editable later, but especially for new users, it's definitely a fairly clear sort of direct drive way to, you know, paint on your model. The downside would be somewhat something like this, right? square. Okay, that's good. But it's actually more red than I wanted on the model. Even if I turn up the roughness here, so it doesn't so it's not as glossy. Um, turning up the roughness doesn't do anything because this is only adjusting the brush as it's painted on right now when I paint. Right? And so I'm gonna delete this one. The better workflow here would be a fill layer that we adjust to the color. Give it roughness. There we go. And then mask it in. Right click, add black mask. And now with the paint tool, I'm painting and getting the same kind of effect, but this is adjustable later on. Right? So I can come in and paint it with a hard brush like this. Wherever I'd want this to be on the dog, like so. And on the hands. Again, I have that symmetry turned on. And coming back and looking at this, where else is the dog on the ears? Yeah. So, the advantage now is like, okay, that still looks too red. I don't need to go back and repaint it because it's a mask on a layer. I can just come in and adjust the fill and everything updates, right? Like so. Or I decide I want the that part to be glossier. Well, that means I can just do that and it updates with the paint layer. Once you make the mark with the brush, it's like painting IRL, right? Like you can't once you get the ink on the canvas, you can't like take it off really. You can cover it up and stuff tricks there, but like you pretty much commit to it. And it's the same structure here. So the fill layer is always more flexible. And so this painting the ear, I could come in and try and navigate the paintbrush or I could come back to the mask, go over to the polygon mode, go to the either mesh. Mesh is going to work because this is a separate mesh, remember? And so if I click on the ear, I'd be able to paint in the entire ear there. And it's in the same mask. So if I again if I come back and adjust any of this right it changes that whole area there making sense. Okay. Um let's save that as is for now.",

And the main thing that you're gonna need to play with here is the target polyc count, right? Because it's not a mesh and it needs to be baked down into a mesh. We want something that's fairly low, but not so low that it's going to destroy the shape. And so, um, let's go down to like maybe half of that. I'm going to turn on global adaptivity, which means it'll kind of try to give it more resolution where it needs it. You could generate UVs at this point.

So, this a little bit of back and forth there, but you know the that's all more or less automatic workflow for an entire quad rettopology of the entire mesh, right? So, if you've taken 185, you're standing up and cheering, right? Um, if you haven't, you too will understand some point. The teeth kind of got let's see what did the teeth look like in the original one. They're a little more prominent there. Something we could add back in if we wanted to at this point. Right. But"

And so that material thing that's coming in as a null. Now we should just be able to join these [Music] There we go. They're all meshes, but convert to mesh join. Do we lose anything there? I'm just making sure they didn't come in with anything strange. No. A there we go. Um now same situation, right? And so we want to mirror this. Um but actually we're going to get our house in order before we even turn the mirror modifier on. So, let's do that. Um, let's get rid of that. Let's grab our anchor point right here. Origins. Move this down to the bottom. It is in the middle. That's where we want. So, turn that off. And then we'll alt G. There we go. Um, we want it facing in the X direction. And so come back to this and rotate that way and come back. And we only see that if we're in the local mode, which is what we want. There we go. Now, uh, make sure scale is not weird. That is fine. Um, now it's at one, but in order to not have a bunch of weirdness in Unity later, having some things that are within cubish size, unless it's going to be way, you know, just making it roughly that size. And so in the object mode, I'm going to scale this up, you know, to right about there. And then control a apply scale so that, you know, it's about the size of the default cube. Okay. Um, that should help us not have a whole bunch of weirdness later. And so now we select it. Now we can give bring in our mirror modifier and make sure that we're mirroring on the Y, bicting on the Y. And only the Y. And yeah, not that one. This one, right? because that's the one with our arms out there. Um, yeah. So, that's our our merge thing here. So, we may want a little more space there. And so, again, the mir the origin helps us, right? So, the maybe that also wasn't like 100% lined up. And so if we were to move the origin, we might be able to adjust that just slightly. All right. So we can't adjust this without screwing up the rest of the body, right? Tab in. Let's grab this part of the mesh. Cr and move this this way so that we can get some more definition on the head shape there without messing up the rest of the body. Right? So similar sort of concept and then tab back out. And so the anchor point remains the same, but we get that eye definition for the character. Very nice. Okay. And if we look at this, uh, we got our bisect, we got our merging. Uh, that all looks pretty good. Let's just double check with our normals to see if anything is looking terrible here. And that all looks fused together. Oh, nope. This is one of the things, right? So, this is totally likely to happen. Uh, so tab in uh grab these faces. Ctrl L mesh. And in this case, because the whole piece is inverted, we can just go to normals flip. Uh but recalculate I outside should also fix it, right? And so now that's good, right? So I'm in four four and I guess it's that version that then shows us. Cool. And so again, we did something in Substance Modeler, but we got it into Blender in order to clean up the mesh that came out and then also make it symmetrical, right? We're just going to make everything else advantageous. And we can again unwrap going into Substance Painter. So let's do that one more time. File um or no over here our delivery. It's in the other version. Is there an add-on for syncing all the add-ons and the different versions of Blender that you have installed? Someone probably has that. It's probably not an add-on.

It didn't apply the mirror modifier upon export. So because you see the one arm is not the same. I think the other button does do that. Says bones for ex sport. If that changes the underlying thing when we bring it in over here. adjust the selected object. There we go. Where was this going? The other folder. Okay. In here. There it is. Auto unwrap. and discard. There we go. >> Super nice. And bake the mesh maps. Make sure there's only one material. Texture set settings or just come up to croissant and bake selected textures. especially because Bonesie has all these nooks and crannies that will be great. Um, and then because you bake the mesh maps, for instance, something here, um, I'm not exactly what sure what visual direction B is going with this, but after you bake the mesh maps, all of the smart materials, right? And so in Substance Painter, we have regular materials, those are just spheres, and then you have smart materials. Smart materials take into account the shape of the object and change the shading procedurally. And so like this dusty plastic, if I just drag that over here to apply it to the entire object, you see that the parts of bones that are closer to each other get dusted here. Uh for those of you with some more Substance Painter experience, each of the smart uh materials is usually a folder. And so you can just sort of look and see which uh just by turning layers on and off which parts are which. Um and we can talk some more about this on Wednesday. But you know there's a few simple things to adjust here in order to use the smart materials as a really nice basis for uh a base layer upon which you can do uh some more work there. Right. So, a little bit different visual style than what we're doing with the dog where we're just primarily concerned with the color. But, you know, if we're going to do something different here, there's some other stuff to take into account, right?

There's a lot of, you know, I try to you could go to a million different program. You could go to a different program to UV unwrap your object, right? Like there's specific programs for everything. But at some point, you like you're just making your workflow more complicated. Is it worth it? And in the case of going to Substance Painter, the answer is, you know, I think unequivocally yes, right? Like it's doing a whole bunch of stuff that even if you install 10 additional add-ons into Blender, it's not going to be the same kind of experience, right? And so coming over here to texture this stuff makes a lot of sense. Sound good?

So, I'm not going to play the whole thing on the stream, obviously, but it's a really solid sort of uh, you know, short film. The same subject matter of so many animated short films of a lone human being in some sort of robot ccentric post-apocalyptic future we seem to be inching closer into every day. Um but"

And then in this case, let's zero. And let's hold down shift. The advantage to making the cubes with the cube thing is that once you you're sort of making them in edit mode and so the cube you end up with at the end is at this scale value which is exactly what we want in this instance. And so if we look there, let's uh bring in another one here. And once they're dialed in, I think it may work a little bit better. And so now if we come back out here to object mode over here and made some other buildings and and apply the same textures here. So, we've got the same thing here and the same thing here. On this one, if we want to have something different, we need to this one right here. So this remember the same material only one material has a the tiling values the way it's set up if you're going to do it in the edi in the shading editor these are part of the actual shader code right and so we need to duplicate this in order to have separate control over one versus the other there.

So part of that is if there are modifiers on these and so the this is the other pain point I've run into a lot recently but it is resolvable in the if we grab everything and we say instant apply modifiers. Then we were to controll J. Ah the car does not implode when we do that. So yeah it the the problem here is that some of the modifiers have if we look at this. There we go. Some of the modifiers have um controls that are in real world, you know, like absolute values rather than like relative values and like the bevel um distance things like that. Yeah. Right. And so when you join them all together, something happens there where it like joins them then applies it or something like that and it's applying this to the size of a part that would not be that that setting would not make sense for.

Um, yeah, I mean, I'm not going to fiddle with any more with those for right now, but we get the, you know, in order to make the close-up work here, we've got our fill light. We ran, we don't have a bump map for Godzilla, so we just took, all we had was the color map, right? which is usually what comes out of a scan depending on what the post-processing was on the scan. You just have one, you know, like this the scan's not doing a normal map. All usually the scan super super dense, which is what Godzilla was here. And so that's gives us this detail. And then the other thing we might want to do here is our uh depth of field. And so make sure we're on Godzilla here.",

And so if we look at that and then look at that in compositing over here, that gives us something that's pretty good. Does the combo of techniques there make sense, right? Cool. And then let's do Godzilla's extreme closeup. So, let's save this and make another camera. Save incremental. There we go. and same thing. But here our extreme closeup, this is something we probably need, right? Like just like other wild animals, you can't get that close to Godzilla, right? And so you need to be using what kind of lens? >> Telephoto. telephoto, right? So, we'll say 120 millimeter and then look through this and then look through the camera. So, we'll go camera to view so that we can kind of get to where we would want. And then I didn't talk about this too much because the primary um parameter for depth of field is f-stop. However, it's easier to get a thin plane of focus with a longer lens. It's another reason that tilt shift stuff works is because it's really because those are super wide lenses to get a big scene like that. You're almost you're never getting unless it's an actual miniature, you're never getting that um shallow depth of field. And so here, um, we definitely want depth of field and we definitely want to be right on Godzilla's nose. The focus distance here was There we go. I'm going bring that down and then use the focus distance to do something like this, which you know, anytime we do this extreme closeup, we want the eye, you know, in focus almost all the time, right? And so that gives us that extreme close-up of Godzilla. The This wasn't working before, right? Because we came Oh, we when we did this, it was good. Yes. Right. So this is part of the object. This is just the object, right? And so we want Godzilla's eye right there. Cool. Let's look at that. And our point light here. I might make sure I say camera not to view so I don't move the camera. And then I give myself another, you know, fill light here to work with. So grab this one. And we will shift D it and bring it up here, over here, over here. Right. And so this is maybe during, you know, like a cut into Godzilla's eyes when the atomic breath shot is going off. And so putting this over here, tinting this like so, right? And then, you know, salting to taste here with the light gives us that extra action along the surface. Uh the other thing here, right now, we're so close that maybe we're losing we're seeing some of the pixels here, right? And so, you know, whatever these textures were, they were pretty good coming in, right? But um if we look at Godzilla itself um we might be able to fake some of this even more if we used a procedural shader, right? And so if we disconnect the what we have here that goes back to you know what we had before just with the color which is you know not didn't hold up for anything but our wide right. Um, and so now, uh, let's disconnect this, put this back into here, and then in the noise is going to be like a vector, you know, it's going to re-evaluate per um There it is. Um, right. This isn't the setting that we want, but you can see now that level of detail is super super tight on Godzilla. So, the There we go. Right? So if you can find the right values here, we could get, you know, again that super low resolution image. I mean, ideally masking out part of the eye here, but we'll see how we can do. Um, and so our strength, there we go, allow us to dial in a little bit. So now we're getting that tiny detail on the surface, right? Because this right this is the this is the advantage of doing this here in Blender, right? There's all sorts of fun noises in Substance Painter as well, right? But you got to bake those out and so you end up with some limited number of pixels. Whereas any sort of procedurally generated noise that's being procedurally generated in the final render environment gets re-evaluated every frame as opposed to you know just a pile of pixels which will be the same for every frame and when you zoom in on them they'll be soft right if we were to come back if we saved this and I am in the extreme close-up camera but if I went back to the full shot here, right? It I mean, you can't see it at all here, but it's being used in the bump channel. And now it's being used in the bump channel here as well. But we've got this because we looking at it really, really closely. It's being re-evaluated at this distance there, which looks good. The main thing here was dialing down the strength probably at zero and then up. Hold down shift to give you a bit. Right. Having this be max black and max white gives you the max amount of, you know, change over here. And then I think the distance is kind of dials it in. But even there, we're not getting too much distortion on the eye. But yeah, so we took something that, you know, was I mean, this is what it looked like before. you know, totally no detail up up close. And that gives us lots of detail up close. Um, cool. And then here, let's go to 30. There we go. And then that's our extreme closeup of Godzilla. Is there any short answer to the eye? Not really.",

The amount right the lens bends the light. It doesn't bend all the light equally. So the amount of bending varies depending on the um wavelength, right? So red being shorter, biv, violet being longer. Um and this is quote unquote This is another one of those things where the CG is too perfect by default, right? Um, this is like a if there's a ton of it, you know, it's looked as like a lowquality lens, right? There's definitely like a school of thinking where you want your lens to be as clean as possible. So, it's not, you know, uh, the style of the lens is not impacting the style of the image. However, this is such a hallmark of passing light through a camera that now it's, you know, definitely been treated in this sort of like postmodern way of amplifying the limitations and the uh irregularities of using cameras, right? And so this is part of um you know like the Spiderverse thing does it in a slightly different way but the idea is that we see the color spectrum separated. Usually it's h happen happening more in a real camera towards the edges of the image. The thing that's in the center ideally a better designed lens won't have a bunch of chromatic aberration in the middle of the image. Right? you'll notice it more towards the edge. And so that's definitely one of the hallmarks. And so that's what's being used here. Right here is what's just coming out of the glow here, right? And so a little flat, right? And the lens distortion is bending the image. And so if we looked at this the distortion amount or dispersion here, let's look at the whole thing. There we go. You can see what's happening. That's going directly there. Right? We're getting more distortion towards the end. It's like a circular displacement kind of thing. Let's turn Let's look at just the distortion. Zero dispersion 0.1 gives us fatter image. Negative.1 negative.1 goes the other direction. Things start to bend in. Right? But that's just the distortion parameter. The dispersion parameter is going to sort of incrementally blur these more as they get towards the edge. And so let's go to 0.1 and then like 0.1. And now we get this also tearing here at the edge. This RGB curves is sort of post-processing. It so if we bring that into the final part of the chain gives us a little bit of difference in terms of the color correction there. Sort of amplifying this. And so we have the amount of glare here into this big difference. Right? Here's what's unprocessed coming out flat. Really gives the whole look a lot more character going into the glare. Right? So that's step one.",

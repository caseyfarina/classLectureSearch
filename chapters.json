Uh mostly adding the candles. Um so, firstly, the candle modeling process was obviously taking a regular cylinder and shaping it into uh somewhat of a candle shape and then subdividing it. Uh or not subdividing, sorry, uh remshing uh with much more polygons and then taking those polygons uh and modeling the the drips and the uh puddles and stuff. Um and the shading process was a simple thing of uh it's mostly in the um the subsurface diffusion and sub surface scattering subsurface scattering in this case the appropriate name right the light goes in below the surface and scatters. So >> welling the RGB values I don't know why they don't name this as the or like they don't label these more appropriately because this is obviously like the color that's going to be showing through. >> Yeah. I mean the I alluded to this the first time like depending on how obtuse the interface designers want to be right there's the the concept of I mean and this happens with surface color too but I I've never seen a program be that obtuse where it's like the the color we're seeing is actually the color that you know is bound reflected off the other colors are absorbed and so if you had a you know if your shader had a absorption color, it would be the opposite of whatever you ended up seeing, right? That's obviously idiotic. But like here, um, yeah, like it's the sort of like what wavelength is getting absorbed and then you'll kind of see the opposite there. But just having it be the color just obviously makes more >> um, just seems a little bit intuitive. though I may have missed something but uh and then we add a texture with a noise texture and utilizing the normal map uh to bake it into the normals. Um and then additionally I did add a candle stand. Uh it was something simple. I didn't really uh want to go through all the trouble of going into Substance Painter making all the mesh maps uh for something as small and unnoticeable frankly as uh uh this. So yeah, uh this one is a similar process to most of the other stuff we did. We subdivided and then beveled. Um I added a simple gold texture. Uh made it a bit shiny. Not too shiny. Um but yeah, that is the uh So yeah, just doing the Substance Painter is what it is. And I think it's, you know, obviously really good for doing super high fidelity textures, but then it's also really good for just learning what what really gets most of the work done, right? And so maybe taking one of the noise patterns and running it into the roughness with a ramp is really most of what you would end up doing in Substance Painter anyway. And then that that would be something to just sort of just take that beyond just like obvious totally plain texture, right? It's the yeah just adding micro variations to any of the parameters to the main primary parameters really is the thing that makes it makes the texture candle itself. And as for the scene, let's go here. Um I did add them into the scene. I wasn't really too sure where to put them, but I think just putting it in this spot is fine. Um, I didn't really adjust anything else to be honest. Uh, but I did change the HDR and the lighting a bit just so we can show off the subsurface scattering of the candles a bit more.

I really apologize about that. this morning. My computer updated last night, and for some reason, every time it does, it throws OBS a curveball and it can't find the the sound, but we're good now. So, here's my candle that I made this weekend. >> Okay. So, yeah, I think your camera's off, but yeah, when that happens, it just makes it black down there, but it's fine. >> Let me zoom out a little bit so you can see a little bit better. Um, so I did pretty much what we did in the video except for the noise I used um for the the subscatter. Um I used a fluid noise cuz I figured, you know, candles, melting wax, more like water uh when they do melt. >> So that way, you know, and I think it turned out pretty good. Um I used So it's not too shiny. Still has that dull. I used a little bit more roughness than I did metallic. you know, so it kind of looked like wax cuz wax has that dull shine to it. So I think it came out pretty well. >> Yeah. And so again, uh another substance painter trick, you know, like the same mask or noise running to multiple things, right? So if you were to take this out of here into a ramp and then just give it some roughness variation, that might be the next step. >> Um little subscattering service that we did. Um so yeah, the radius, the weight all the way up. um roughness and metallic. And then I also did change the scale and the the scale um radius. I think that's what that one is. I don't know. It won't get it any bigger. Um but yeah, so we'll go through the layout and wireframe view sculpting. Um so you can see a little bit better. I did make little puddles, melted wax on the bottom. It's more melted on this side, you know, where the puddle is a little bit bigger. You can see where it kind of like runs into that. And then I did leave these little like balls of wax, you know, melted down and then maybe cooled. Um the c the candle does look a little misshapen, but you know, it's just heat, you know, but >> yeah, I like that about that. Looks, you know, >> and then so wireframe. There's that. And you can see turn off that. >> Yeah. So in terms of like the efficacy of the sculpting tools, this is, you know, low to the point where, you know, some of the tools might not be as responsive as you would want, right? Um, so, >> um, and you see where it kind of bowls out, melted. Um, so there's that in the wireframe. And then I did extend it down into the candle holder. Um, so it would actually sit because I didn't make like a raised edge uh center to put the candle in. But yeah, that's it in wireframe and the view. And then for my table scene, turn that on. Give it a minute. This is still in Eevees, by the way. Um, when I put it through uh Scaler, it um doesn't like it. My computer doesn't. Um, but yeah, there's them sitting there. Um, I also did increase the size of my leaves. Um, that was pretty crazy because I had to go through and move the actual uh area, scale it up, move it. Um, because if you get in really close, actually, oh, yeah, I'm on camera. Sorry. Uh, so when you get in really close, you can see they kind of cut through the branch. Uh, and on some of them, like I moved it a little bit. There was on some where the you see here where it goes through the branch, but I just I tried to move it as best I could, you know, to make it look halfway decent. So, but you know, I'm trying to think if there's a way to make the branches thinner at this point that's not if you were scaling along the normals because yeah that it is cutting into them a little bit but the branches are on the thick side to begin with. Um but these are not curves anymore. They are um meshes. And so if we have something like this that Right. And then we convert to mesh. Uh, and then we just want to make it thinner without changing the scale. So, Individual origins along normal Wow. Gizmo does something really weird there. Um, the only thing I can think of is what if we went to here? Yeah, scaling along normals in this particular instance didn't seem to really just get us what we want. If I grab this and then come back to here, sculpt mode and there is that inflate brush and make this bigger and hit control. Yeah, that works. So that wouldn't require um the reuving of anything and yeah and so the inflate brush but u in deflate mode. So, I'm holding down control. And so, this would be a way that you could thin out your branches, which would make that leaf stem problem uh less of a visual obviously, you know, visual thing. And then your branches were pretty on they were were thick uh to begin with. So, that would that might help there. at a very very far, you know, point. It looks really nice because you can't see all the mistakes. But yeah, I think the candle and the candle holders came out well. Um used just a bronze texture, like a noise, and then made it look bronze through um some gradient. So yeah, that's it. That's my uh scene with the candles. So pretty much everything's the same, just added candles. >> Cool. Great. You get a Tony the Tiger. All right. You guys know who that is? >> Frosted Flakes. Jack.",

    "search_text": "AVC185 December 03, 2025 Student Feedback: Thick Candle Sculpting >> Hey, this is Jack with 185. Um, and we're taking a look at the candle we made for this week. So, yeah, this is the candle in question. I pretty much did what we >> Is this is this earlier in the day or is this the next day? >> Earlier in the day. So, you're fresher here. >> We talked about I made mine a little thicker of a candle. Um, but yeah, it was really fun to mess with the sculpting. It's kind of my first time like really trying to do sculpting stuff. I think my biggest issue is I've got a lot of like like rough things here and like you know it was really a balance between like the smooth like if I smooth this out it's just going to like completely decimate it like not even have the detail there. And then so the size of the smoothing brush is a big like the main thing, right? Right. So when you hold down shift and use a smoothing brush and then by default the brush will be in that relative to screen size mode. And so like your scroll wheel zooming in and out here, right? Because smoothing is averaging. And if you have a bigger area that you're averaging, you're you're decimating you're it's not decimation is something else, but you're uh removing features from this large, you know, area. And so if you zoom in further and make the brush smaller and just, you know, run it closer to these things, then you'll be able to smooth out things without totally obliterating the >> I leave it there. It just looks like weird and bumpy kind. Or you can switch the brush mode to um space. No. Uh yeah. Scene. And now uh your F will it'll stay relative. And so I usually keep it in the other mode. But either way, the thing is that the brush is smaller >> kind of although it kind of works being bumpy, but I don't know. It looks like a bad bumpy almost like a low res type bumpy. I don't know if that's like not enough faces here or not. This felt like a lot, but again, I'm not sure more than this. >> No, that that's that's a sculpting. 95,000 faces. That seems like a lot for something like this, but yeah, again, maybe I'm being too stingy. And yeah, I mostly use a lot of the blob brush and the elastic grab brush um as well as the crease sharp to kind of sharpen up some of the uh where the wax and the drips like kind of meet. And I tried to >> Yeah. So, especially with once you put the subsurface scattering on there, the the way the subsurface scattering works is that it kind, you know, like light goes in and then lights up the parts of it that would usually be darker, right? And so it kind of works against the definition of shape that we get from ambient occlusion and shadowing. And so in some cases, um, especially on something that's like very has a strong subsurface profile like the candle does, maybe the crease sharp is more aggressive than you would think, you know, at the beginning. Uh, or, you know, this, you know, like 95,000 is not a ludicrous number. And so there's no reason you can't be looking at the sub subsurface while you're sculpting here, right? Um if this were a much bigger file than than Yeah. But um but here you could just look at the actual so that you you know you don't have to abstract your decision- making. You can see exactly what's happening. to like think about how things would um I usually see on candles like there's like one side that just happens to get hotter and like that's where everything kind of rolls down and then it's just like the other side just like doesn't really get affected. And yeah, so that's what I did. So I had like a bunch of the wax pulling down here trying to make it realistic like about as much that was would be up here maybe. I don't know. This is really cool to have it uh come down like that. Um but yeah, I might not have enough faces and stuff if we're going to retapize it anyways. I guess doesn't really matter, but maybe. I don't know. And I made a little candle wick as well. And then I made a nice little candle holder here. And uh it all looks pretty nice. Here's it in material preview view just so you can see with HDR. Um yeah. So I painted this in Substance Painter. Um this as a reference. Um it's >> cool. Yeah, you flatten the reference there. >> It's like a fake candle that he's as a reference. So, I mean, probably not the greatest, but um I made the candle holder pretty similar. This I really like this like look of like this like super drippy candle. This is like the harsher light in front of it uh to accentuate that look a little bit. But I have this render of like a softer look with the subsurface scattering, but it is very subtle. And then yeah, that's it with like um this this with the same lighting at least like a more aggressive um subsurface. Um it might be too white. I can maybe tone that down a bit. Um, but yeah, I added the added a noise texture and to normal map. Change the color of the subsurface scattering to be orang-ish. So yeah, I believe that is mostly it. I can bring this closer to get more of a aggressive look, but oh, I also unwrapped it like slightly um because the noise was not working correctly. So I did have to like add some seams. I don't know. It was kind of really bad. So yeah. >> So the vector that's feeding into the noise there, was it hooked up to the I can't quite see. There's some sort of noise here. So yeah, if you feed that something that's world space then then you know like you like UV space is an option you know uh and so that you know that the using either world space or object space is like roughly similar to using the trip planer projection >> working correctly. So, I did have to like add some seams that I don't know. It was kind of really bad. So, yeah, that's it. Thank you for watching. Invite. >> Is it floating? >> No, >> just a light maybe that makes it look like that. Yeah. >> Oh, yeah. There is a weird light or no, it's a >> What's that? like an object that's like making a fake shadow >> or it's a shadow cast by something that makes a really strange >> Yeah. I mean, it's just this light here that's making it look weird. Yeah. Yeah. Constraining that light to just the candle, you know, but you know, when we put the the light, you know, the flame on there would be different. >> So, like your >> Yeah, it looks really great. >> And Crimson,",

So, especially with once you put the subsurface scattering on there, the the way the subsurface scattering works is that it kind, you know, like light goes in and then lights up the parts of it that would usually be darker, right? And so it kind of works against the definition of shape that we get from ambient occlusion and shadowing. And so in some cases, um, especially on something that's like very has a strong subsurface profile like the candle does, maybe the crease sharp is more aggressive than you would think, you know, at the beginning. Uh, or, you know, this, you know, like 95,000 is not a ludicrous number. And so there's no reason you can't be looking at the sub subsurface while you're sculpting here, right? Um if this were a much bigger file than than Yeah. But um but here you could just look at the actual so that you you know you don't have to abstract your decision- making. You can see exactly what's happening. to like think about how things would um I usually see on candles like there's like one side that just happens to get hotter and like that's where everything kind of rolls down and then it's just like the other side just like doesn't really get affected. And yeah, so that's what I did. So I had like a bunch of the wax pulling down here trying to make it realistic like about as much that was would be up here maybe. I don't know. This is really cool to have it uh come down like that. Um but yeah, I might not have enough faces and stuff if we're going to retapize it anyways. I guess doesn't really matter, but maybe. I don't know. And I made a little candle wick as well. And then I made a nice little candle holder here. And uh it all looks pretty nice. Here's it in material preview view just so you can see with HDR. Um yeah. So I painted this in Substance Painter. Um this as a reference. Um it's >> cool. Yeah, you flatten the reference there. >> It's like a fake candle that he's as a reference. So, I mean, probably not the greatest, but um I made the candle holder pretty similar. This I really like this like look of like this like super drippy candle. This is like the harsher light in front of it uh to accentuate that look a little bit. But I have this render of like a softer look with the subsurface scattering, but it is very subtle. And then yeah, that's it with like um this this with the same lighting at least like a more aggressive um subsurface. Um it might be too white. I can maybe tone that down a bit. Um, but yeah, I added the added a noise texture and to normal map. Change the color of the subsurface scattering to be orang-ish. So yeah, I believe that is mostly it. I can bring this closer to get more of a aggressive look, but oh, I also unwrapped it like slightly um because the noise was not working correctly. So I did have to like add some seams. I don't know. It was kind of really bad. So yeah. >> So the vector that's feeding into the noise there, was it hooked up to the I can't quite see. There's some sort of noise here. So yeah, if you feed that something that's world space then then you know like you like UV space is an option you know uh and so that you know that the using either world space or object space is like roughly similar to using the trip planer projection >> working correctly. So, I did have to like add some seams that I don't know. It was kind of really bad. So, yeah, that's it. Thank you for watching. Invite. >> Is it floating? >> No, >> just a light maybe that makes it look like that. Yeah. >> Oh, yeah. There is a weird light or no, it's a >> What's that? like an object that's like making a fake shadow >> or it's a shadow cast by something that makes a really strange >> Yeah. I mean, it's just this light here that's making it look weird. Yeah. Yeah. Constraining that light to just the candle, you know, but you know, when we put the the light, you know, the flame on there would be different. >> So, like your >> Yeah, it looks really great. >> And Crimson,"

I really think the waxy effect uh worked pretty well. Um I like it a lot. And here is just simple little what the nodes look like. So there's that. And then within the actual scene itself, here is it on the table. Got that one there, that one there. And then this is what the picture that I chose for my angle for my render. Here's that and there. >> Yeah. Dutch angle of your table there. Right. That when it's when the horizon line doesn't go relatively straight, you know, it's off at an angle like that. That's a Dutch angle. Also, it looks like the silverware is floating. Yeah, definitely. I think is the other silverware floating. No, that looks quasi correct. I think these are definitely floating. Chose for my angle for my render. Here's that and there. And yeah, um overall I really like the candle actually. I like it more when it's um highlighted like by itself like this. I think it gets lost in everything on the actual table. >> Yeah, your HDR is really bright, you know, like it's like daytime beach and so yeah, the subtle illumination of the dark side of the candle is kind of blown out by the just the brightness of the scene. So maybe taking your HDR strength and turning it down a little bit or picking, you know, an evening HDR, sunset, beach, wedding. Yes. I kind of just want to add something as well. >> So performance issues. >> Yeah. Yeah. The thickness the thickness map. But I really do think that the the whole like glossy waxy effect actually worked out really well and I'm pretty proud of it. So yeah, there's my candle. Thank you. >> All right. And the other thing with yours is the >> Hi, it's Crimson. >> Going back and looking, I think you ended up saying you used like a Blender kit glass or something. And yeah, like we're just getting zero transparency here. And so if the transmission is turned the whole way up, the two things you might do here is bring the IUR closer to one. Don't go below, you know, you you don't want it one exactly and you don't want it below one, but that's going to make it the reflections less strong. And then mixing in, we ended up mixing a little bit of alpha, right? So taking the alpha channel and making it less, you know, like maybe 0.8 eight or something so that we can see the stuff behind the glass. Right? This is the I mentioned this when we were talking about glass before. Especially if you just put glass on like a sphere, the way it's treated is as if you made a solid glass sphere, right? Like it's like like a like a glob of totally solid glass. No air inside. Whereas you have to actually make the geometry doublewalled in order to make it render like it actually is what usually people are thinking of a like a globe where there's you know empty space inside. Um because when it's a solid piece of glass, the amount of refraction the yeah I guess the amount of refraction there's more refraction because this you know the light is bent more because it's passing through much more it's passing through a thick substrate over a much longer distance uh than it is on like a glasswalled thing. So that you know it's a little counterintuitive from what people usually think when they throw a class on something. All right, Evan.",

And then I also changed the change the texture and the color of the of the material. So to add like more green tones, you know, to emphasize the vine like quality of these branches. And yeah, that's all for this week. Thanks for watching."

But let's see how it handles this. I mean, why not just >> Yeah, there's no it's not doing anything there because they were just in Did you you brought them over as the >> I just did control >> and then hooked everything up that way. like before I realiz >> I'm not using >> Yeah, the I don't know if that's there if you use the uh USD method, right, where everything comes over in one and you don't have to hook up the textures.

Uh, and table's floating, but you get the idea. Uh, and so edit 3D settings. >> I don't know. It looks good enough to be a game. >> Yeah, maybe this will end up in I don't know what's the next Bethesda game. Um, >> apparently Scar, but Is that where we're on?

Yeah, I really want to try that. >> Yeah, it does look cool. I have not tried that one either. All right, so so scene settings here. Um, the big things to take care of here are, you know, the camera. You can, uh, set the field of view on the camera. Um the the yeah here are background background. This is another situation where you could have a background color and then you know like the HDR is just there for the reflections. And so, uh, over here under lighting, I believe we can select, uh, an HDR. And again, you can rotate it around. It's kind of linked to a directional light. And so, you'll get that shadowing as well as some, you know, like brightness and exposure. Um, and yeah, the shadowing here. Um, so and that should not Yeah, we don't see it in the background because we have the other background on there. The then under materials here, I guess we are going to have access to each one, which is useful here. Uh, in this case, if you have the alpha channels like Jack does and you don't have don't want to go back and edit the Blender files there. Although I mean in all honesty like then when you package it up like the Blender file will be that much smaller as well. So you know uh but either way sort of per like just on the table here you could say no opacity but then since it is going to be a separate material that we have for the wine glasses and our other glasses and our candle then um can I just click on things here and it changes. Yeah, I think that's better than it used to be. Um, and so now, you know, if I turn off the opacity on this, it makes a difference there. The other thing, yeah, I don't think we've used the candles before when we uploaded. So now you'll be able to say, yes, subsurface because remember subsurface subsurface scattering is not baked into the texture. It is a function because it's dependent on the camera and the angle. It's like it's like the Frenel. It's like fresnel shading. You can't make a texture for fresnel shading, right? It's always about how we're looking at the thing from the view of the camera. So, it needs to be calculated at render time. And same thing here. So, this would we would opt in for the um candle. Bringing that in here. Then, uh yeah, under opacity, right? And so again like I've you know our GLA glass tinkering in EV you know did require exactly that right and same thing here because in slightly different situations depending on the render engine and so here in their render engine and this render engine is you know much closer to EV than it is cycles right because think it's like a web- based thing that you just anyone can load in their phone or whatever. And so, um, you know, like it's not going to be doing the path tracing that cycle is doing. And so you can uh dial in the, you know, amount of refraction on the glass shader there. Uh roughness This is kind of like what mode do we want it in? We want it in refraction mode here. Uh so those are the main things. There's also post-processing here. Uh so uh screen space ambient occlusion. So again ambient occlusion calculated at render time. So, you know, ambient occlusion can be baked in, right? For something like this where like these nooks and crannies, this, you know, unless this is like a lamp character, right? That's not going to change, right? It's going to have this static rigid shape, but the amount of like if the lamp was like this or if the lamp was over on its side, then different parts would be coming in contact with the table and forming nooks and crannies there, which would be calculated then at render time via screen space ambient occlusion, right? All right. So, inclusion is a little bit confusing in that you can have a baked map for it and you can also do it at render time. Uh or you can do some combination of both, right? Um so, so there's that. Um and what else is on screen place reflections by default? This table is pretty greasy. So, this is kind of like turning on the uh ray trace setting in Blender EV there. Uh, and then, yeah, there's a bunch of other, you know, fiddly things you can do here in terms of film grain or putting depth of field uh on the camera here. um which you know is useful, but then you know you want you don't want it to actually interfere with the you know the ability to show off your thing here. So maybe not. Um and yeah, some other like post-processing stuff like that's that's ridiculous. That's the default chromatic aberration setting. I may have messed with that previously. I find that hard to believe. And like we discussed before, vignetting, blooming. All right. Especially here on the glass. A little bit of that is nice. Uh yeah. And we're not animating. And yeah, the you can like they have a VR app. You can also load it on your phone and then project stuff in AR into space um and look at it that way. And so yeah, I guess here we'd want the table to be Oh, no. Okay, you make the person smaller. That's kind of weird. Anyway, um yeah. And so everything is there. Let's go back and see if we got processed. We did get processed. All right. Let's see what's going on. H. This is a weird one. We not have not had this before where you had to repopulate these things. is it just No, it's these napkins, too. Yeah, it didn't link up any of those things. Maybe in the format that we uploaded, you couldn't find the stuff. Uh, yeah. Regardless, this is more configurable than I remember it being. I mean, the ability to come in here and select the ones that you need to have in the appropriate slots is great, but I wonder if there's anything in the export here when we're talking about an entire scene that could help.

Yeah, it looks like Let's see if he scrolls down here. It looks like they're in billboard mode. And for leaves, yeah, that's not what we would want for leaves. Um, he does have a transparent leaf texture in there. I think if we get a little bit closer, the LOD here stands for anybody remember >> levels of detail. So, this is a tree he's using from a pack. And as is usual with trees, uh there's a few different versions of the tree that give you different uh levels of detail. So here you've got the particle system on one tree. And I think a better uh strategy here might be if your trees are in groups to um have one particle system that kind of spans the area of the forest that uh is emitting leaves rather than multiple particle systems. uh one on each tree. >> And would you normally want something closer to the bottom with the leaves? >> Yeah. I mean like we're not going to see any of this. So that's just not being used. Yeah. So probably some big box that sits, you know, maybe a little bit up into wherever the lower canopy is of the tree. Something to that effect. Um but okay. So, uh, there may be some other people interested in leaves, uh, or interested in never-ending infinite explosions. That's what that would look like. This game just got a whole lot more exciting. >> Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't have soft particles right now. Okay. So, for leaves, uh, let's grab this one. Let's turn this off so we can see what we're doing. Uh, let's make a new particle system. Okay. And uh, we need a leaf. That's a PNG. So, uh making something in We'll make a very quick leaf here. In this case, we want just one leaf. So, And I'm going to get rid of that stem. All right. And let's make sure it's a PNG. So, export as PNG and put this over here. Um, yeah, just in this folder is fine. Okay, great. And back over here, let's bring that in. Okay. And make sure that this is a sprite with transparency. There we go. That gives us what we want. Okay. Now, back over here. Um, or actually, let's make our material. So, um particles and lit and here and transparent. We want to make sure we see both faces because this one's going to flip around. And there we go. We're cutting that out. Okay. And then over here, let's call this leaves. And first, we'll get the kind of shape we want. Like we said, some sort of larger box rather than doing it on each tree. And so it's big. Let's say or there we go. Something like that. Um, let's just go ahead and flip it so that we're going the other way. And here let's bring in our material. Um, yeah, we can make it smaller or set it to rectangle. Hold on. Let me put this in here. There we go. Yeah. So, we don't see them pop in at all within the space. So okay. And let's make this much less speed. So like 0.1 and three or something. And they're probably going to need to live longer. Maybe three. Okay. Uh, great. Now, the biggest thing here is that the default billboard is not going to make convincing leaves because the leaves are actually, you know, they're flat things, but they flip around in 3D space. So, down here, uh, yeah, billboard's not going to work. We need to go to I usually do this with a mesh. Uh, and so the mesh allows us to load a 3D mesh into this, right? So, um, another application with the mesh here would be bubbles, uh, that type of thing. And so, here we just want a plane. The default plane gives us that. The problem is they're just too big, obviously. And now you see that they're not sort of functioning like they were before. Let's go ahead and uh render world. All right. Now they're in world space. So I can look around where they Yeah, I can look around the side, which I can't do when I'm in billboard mode. uh scale up here. Start size between two constants. Let's say 0.1 and 0 2. Okay, maybe even less five and 0.1. Let's just make them green for now. Okay. And now uh rotation over lifetime. And so this allows us to start getting you know this because we have a plane now it rotates in 3D space. Um the speed of rotation here we can go random between two constants. And so if we said like five and 100, right? Some of them are flipping faster than others. Now, um we want them to somewhat speed up. And so the gravity source here, maybe not that much, maybe 0.1. There we go. And you also want them to hit the ground. This gets a little bit tricky. So the the simplest solution here is probably to just get rid of them when they hit the ground. And so if you put on collision and you say world and then we obviously don't want them to bounce. We want them to Yeah, you have to set the kill speed. So, max kill speed zero. There we go. So, now they kind of eliminate themselves when they hit the ground. They're not bouncing back up. Um, if you set this bounce to zero and you turn this up slightly now, they'll hit the ground. But getting them to stop rotating when they hit the ground can be uh there's like several there's no single checkbox for that and requires quite a bit of clicking. I've done that a couple times but like it's like several several things. Um, so having them just sort of go away or either fade out when they hit the ground works. Um, and then I think the next main thing here is to add some noise to their movement. So the strength here is going to be like our wind power and then the frequency is sort of our wind direction. And so now, yeah, you end up with something that looks way more leaf like. And yeah, when you add the noise, some of them will blow back up, but this ends up, you know, the movement of it ends up looking way more like leaves because at least now they're flipping around in all those different directions. Um, and then our emission over time. Um, yeah. I mean, you can be conservative here with this one. I don't think it needs to be a gazillion um leaves coming out. And there we go. Um yeah, the main thing here is in order to get the 3D rotation is that we need to make sure that you switch from billboard which can't sort of rotate end over end. It only rotates, you know, relative to the view. And so selecting a plane, the plane should be there by default. Um, and then having the correct material. You could even use a sprite sheet with several different leaves on it. Um, let's see if we do maybe they fixed this or made it a little bit easier if they end up on the ground. And then we turned up dampen Another possible option is rotation by speed so that when they're moving they're rotating but when they stop they stop. But let's see if that works. um random between two constants zero and 90, right? So it's three values because you're random three axes here. So it's a vector three and we're still rotating when we hit the ground. It dampens the here. Put this at one. Still rotating when we hit the ground. Yeah. Even though they're stopped, they're still rotating. There's no rotation speed up here because if this is off, they shouldn't rotate at all. They don't. And they sit still. But maybe rotation over lifetime, but setting it to curve. And so here if there was a point at which they stopped They're still doing it. Separate axes gives us three curves. Just a lot to wrangle. They're just rotating slower. >> This50 Maybe. Yeah. Let's see if this helps. So here, right click, edit key, time was zero. Yeah, even when our range is zero, they're still spinning. That looks lower on the ground. They don't lay flat. So, there's that. They kind of stick into the ground. It's a lot of finigling. Just having them sort of disappear when they hit the ground saves some work there. Yeah, I think this is like as close as I've gotten in the past doing this kind of thing where they still kind of like stick into the ground as much. Um, but yeah, the collision here getting around ends up working because then at least you have it, you know, moving around during the game and now they flip around. But you had the right idea. Just one larger one I think works better than a bunch of smaller ones, especially because you already have a bunch of trees and everything in the game. So on and so forth. So let's save that one. The main thing there is that we have some sort of um uh mesh, right? So, if we were to copy and paste this one and call this bubbles and change this to sphere. And then you can change your start size and get rid of that material. All right. So, it could be bubbles, it could just be floating glowy orbs, it could be um yeah, a bunch of stuff there. The leaf technique here also useful for dust. Right? So if the leaves are very small here, 01 and 02 right now, we just sort of have specks of junk floating around in the air. And so this um especially if you turned up the slow them down a little bit um some of the modules here seem to fight each other eventually. Let's turn this down. There's not a situation where you want to have them all turned on. If our initial velocity zero. And then down here under noise. We can sort of just have dust blowing around in the air there, right? So, in the submarine or in any uh in a catacomb or Egyptian tomb, right? Uh this would all work really well. And yeah, I mean, in terms of a sprite sheet for dust, you know, just some sort of squigglies. um because you're going to make them really small. That works uh for this. Uh but again, probably having them on planes, you know, allows them to spin over and even though they're super super super small, just that little bit of spinning helps a lot there in terms of that. Um yeah. Okay. And then I think Bo",
    "transcript_segment": "So, this is one where depending on what you're doing. >> Yeah. Yeah, it looks like Let's see if he scrolls down here. It looks like they're in billboard mode. And for leaves, yeah, that's not what we would want for leaves. Um, he does have a transparent leaf texture in there. I think if we get a little bit closer, the LOD here stands for anybody remember >> levels of detail. So, this is a tree he's using from a pack. And as is usual with trees, uh there's a few different versions of the tree that give you different uh levels of detail. So here you've got the particle system on one tree. And I think a better uh strategy here might be if your trees are in groups to um have one particle system that kind of spans the area of the forest that uh is emitting leaves rather than multiple particle systems. uh one on each tree. >> And would you normally want something closer to the bottom with the leaves? >> Yeah. I mean like we're not going to see any of this. So that's just not being used. Yeah. So probably some big box that sits, you know, maybe a little bit up into wherever the lower canopy is of the tree. Something to that effect. Um but okay. So, uh, there may be some other people interested in leaves, uh, or interested in never-ending infinite explosions. That's what that would look like. This game just got a whole lot more exciting. >> Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't have soft particles right now. Okay. So, for leaves, uh, let's grab this one. Let's turn this off so we can see what we're doing. Uh, let's make a new particle system. Okay. And uh, we need a leaf. That's a PNG. So, uh making something in We'll make a very quick leaf here. In this case, we want just one leaf. So, And I'm going to get rid of that stem. All right. And let's make sure it's a PNG. So, export as PNG and put this over here. Um, yeah, just in this folder is fine. Okay, great. And back over here, let's bring that in. Okay. And make sure that this is a sprite with transparency. There we go. That gives us what we want. Okay. Now, back over here. Um, or actually, let's make our material. So, um particles and lit and here and transparent. We want to make sure we see both faces because this one's going to flip around. And there we go. We're cutting that out. Okay. And then over here, let's call this leaves. And first, we'll get the kind of shape we want. Like we said, some sort of larger box rather than doing it on each tree. And so it's big. Let's say or there we go. Something like that. Um, let's just go ahead and flip it so that we're going the other way. And here let's bring in our material. Um, yeah, we can make it smaller or set it to rectangle. Hold on. Let me put this in here. There we go. Yeah. So, we don't see them pop in at all within the space. So okay. And let's make this much less speed. So like 0.1 and three or something. And they're probably going to need to live longer. Maybe three. Okay. Uh, great. Now, the biggest thing here is that the default billboard is not going to make convincing leaves because the leaves are actually, you know, they're flat things, but they flip around in 3D space. So, down here, uh, yeah, billboard's not going to work. We need to go to I usually do this with a mesh. Uh, and so the mesh allows us to load a 3D mesh into this, right? So, um, another application with the mesh here would be bubbles, uh, that type of thing. And so, here we just want a plane. The default plane gives us that. The problem is they're just too big, obviously. And now you see that they're not sort of functioning like they were before. Let's go ahead and uh render world. All right. Now they're in world space. So I can look around where they Yeah, I can look around the side, which I can't do when I'm in billboard mode. uh scale up here. Start size between two constants. Let's say 0.1 and 0 2. Okay, maybe even less five and 0.1. Let's just make them green for now. Okay. And now uh rotation over lifetime. And so this allows us to start getting you know this because we have a plane now it rotates in 3D space. Um the speed of rotation here we can go random between two constants. And so if we said like five and 100, right? Some of them are flipping faster than others. Now, um we want them to somewhat speed up. And so the gravity source here, maybe not that much, maybe 0.1. There we go. And you also want them to hit the ground. This gets a little bit tricky. So the the simplest solution here is probably to just get rid of them when they hit the ground. And so if you put on collision and you say world and then we obviously don't want them to bounce. We want them to Yeah, you have to set the kill speed. So, max kill speed zero. There we go. So, now they kind of eliminate themselves when they hit the ground. They're not bouncing back up. Um, if you set this bounce to zero and you turn this up slightly now, they'll hit the ground. But getting them to stop rotating when they hit the ground can be uh there's like several there's no single checkbox for that and requires quite a bit of clicking. I've done that a couple times but like it's like several several things. Um, so having them just sort of go away or either fade out when they hit the ground works. Um, and then I think the next main thing here is to add some noise to their movement. So the strength here is going to be like our wind power and then the frequency is sort of our wind direction.

Um the uh B one one of B's interactables was like super it was the game was hanging when you walked into that um collider and you know this uh Bo had good instincts here but um each collider needs to be you know calculated here. Uh the computer needs to figure out like where is this shape in space and when another collider gets close it's not doing it every frame. there is like a you know like this this windowing that happens when it gets close then it starts figuring out like did they touch did they touch did they touch and so the this calculation gets much more uh much more complicated quickly when the shapes that we're testing are not regular shapes right spheres being the absolute easiest because this figuring out whether or not you're within a spherical radius is just very very basic trigonometry. As soon as you start doing any other more complicated shape uh especially a mesh that may have a very complicated shape with holes in it and indents and stuff then this calculation even for two meshes hitting each other becomes much more complicated. And so the main problem with Bose was that um he did have triggers that were box colliders, which is correct, but then he also had mesh colliders on like several objects that were nested within each other and they all turned on at the same time and that's what caused the uh just freeze essentially for almost like half a second. Uh, so there's pretty much I mean I can't think of a bunch of situations where you're going to want to have multiple colliders on one object if you find yourself doing that. Step back and ask, is this really the best way to go about this? Right? I mean, there's a handful of situations, you know, like our colliders without a trigger are primarily for physics stuff. you know, something's gonna fall over, if we're going to push it, whatever it is, right? Um, the trigger boxes most of the time, try to do it with a box or a sphere and then, you know, only if absolutely necessary, try to do it with something else there. But then, yeah, putting both of those on, like Bose's character walked into the area, and then it was like a parent object with a box and a mesh collider and then like three child objects that were within that collider that also had those two colliders on them. And so it was like trying to figure out like what's touching what. Everything was overlapping. And so that uh was the was the primary issue there. And the uh Bo added the mesh colliders because when he animated the he had like potions coming out of a chest and he wanted them to not he he used the animate script to move them but he wanted them to kind of like not hit the side of the chest. And his instinct here was to put a mesh collider so that it would force itself up and around. And that's just not how it's designed to work. You just want to animate it going up and out, right? And remember in the animate, you know, in the animate script, you can't have multiple tracks for multiple transform properties, right? So, animating it moving plus going up and down can animate going out. Uh, I put the screenshot of what that looks like on Discord over the weekend. Uh, it's somewhere Yeah. Here. Right. So, the position Y goes up and over and the position Z just goes off to the side. Right. And so, that um would be a hop there. But I'm sure he wasn't the only person running into that. just sort of he had a very condensed um version of that that was really tanking the performance for for a minute there. But once I removed the mesh colliders from the whole stack, then it worked fine. Everything else was was totally cool. So yeah, I mean I've tried, you know, the best possible here with the scripts to make sure that the default state isn't going to be something that's going to totally decrease performance, but you know, the possibility of adding stuff that does decrease performance is totally totally possible. So, uh, you being aware of that. One of them being multiple colliders per per thing is not not usually the way to go there. Okay,",

    "search_text": "AVC200 December 03, 2025 Student Feedback: Landon's Tunnel Game here's Adrian. Hello, my name is Adrian Agula and um this is my um priv and uh on the particles too on my game. Here we go. We have to wait for the stuff to load. Um, I was able to get a fire asset for um, torches and stuff like that. Um, I was able to make a big old forest. Let's go, shall we? I do have to put the mesh colliders or renderers. >> Okay. Should you put a mesh collider on the tree is my question to you. >> Okay. I would try to get away with a box because there's so many trees, right? Like just something because your your character probably I don't think is jumping up into the canopy of the trees, right? And so we just need them to not run into the trunk of the tree. And so with so many trees, yeah, just um a box would be I think the the better way to go there. >> And then over here, >> right, all the other scenes we're doing before were small, right? And so now, especially with forests, lot of objects. And so now the tiny tiny performance losses that were kind of insignificant before because we just had like three objects now matter because we have like a 100 objects. >> Here um is the collectibles. I don't know why but the doors open even if I'm not there. Um, and that once I go in, then the doors actually close for some reason. Like it's reverse for some reason. I don't know. >> Do you show us that object >> the the door? Yeah. >> Okay. Uh, post a screenshot of that if you can. I mean, if the doors are opening when you're not there, either the trigger is not set to only look for the player tag. That might be a possibility, right? Um, is it a input? Is it a trigger zone that the character is supposed to walk into? >> Yeah, input trigger zone. By default, that's set to capital P player. So, it's possible your player is not tagged player. Uh, although that wouldn't mean it would automatically do it without that. And the other thing is that if depending on how you're animating the doors opening, did you do it with the animator tour or the script? >> Okay, then that may be set to just play on awake. Um remember with the anime tour right the using the anime tour for door opening and things like that is you know a lot of you need to have the you know this is uh open and then you need to have your start um game enter. The game enter needs to go to a stop state and then uh you need to play open and then open needs to go to a stay open state, right? There's just a lot of stuff to manage there. And so it may be in your interest to use the script there. It's part of the reason I made the script is for these simpler animation situations so you don't have to have you're not managing six states in a state machine to get the door to open and close. I did double check and did a lot of stuff. I don't know why it's like this. Um I do have to put um colliders for some reason. I don't know why they're not working. Um here are the collectibles, which is some spirits. You collect them and you go up and stuff like that. I might um add some for the alpha. I might add like a just a simple like go around the forest, collect these spirits, and then you win once you go into the mines where it goes to this cave to this dragon. Yeah, there will be a dragon. Just uh I might not model the dragon because it's going to be maybe really too difficult and complicated to model. Um to model, not to model exactly, but to rig it because I do not know how to rig. um exactly anything. Um because I did try rigging um on my own time and I failed horribly. Um and I don't know how to rig like animals and stuff like that. Um but other than that, there will be a dragon in here. Um other than that, I was able to add like rain. I don't know where the rain went. Um I was able to add rain. Oh, there's the rain. Rain. Um I will add thunder. Um, >> so is it one gigantic rain that's over the entire scene? Okay, so we talked about that having the rain like the Charlie Brown paradigm, right? It's like a smaller rain that's a child of or constrained to the player and follows the player around. Um, as long as you have the what's the most important um, particle parameter there? >> Yeah, world space. And it's the listed as simulation space. And you want to set that to world, right? Because in order to have the rain, the the reason we're like, is it raining? Oh, it was rain. Oh, no, it's not raining. Oh, it's raining, right? Is because you have your huge rain area. And in order to actually make that seem dense enough, you would have to crank up the number of particles to, you know, a large number, right? And then how many of you only would be seeing some very small fraction of them at one time, right? There is I I don't know exactly what's happening behind the scenes. there is some sort of calling there and that it's not dumping a bunch of time into stuff that's not on screen. But nevertheless, in order to have it be somewhat closer here, like the particle system itself, you can put a constraint on it, right? So here, uh, right? So, uh, parent constraint, you could say I want this to follow the player, wherever the player is over here. I turn off the player in this one. Where is my player? I think this is just a whatever it is. Let's say that this thing is the player. And um you need to click that activate button and then it would follow the player around. And so you could make it smaller. But the the other setting I was telling you about which you should definitely write down is simulation space. Yep. And so world is going to be the key here. When it's local, that means like the raindrops would move with the player, which is going to look not right. Right. The raindrops, you want the raindrops to move independent of the player. >> I do want to like make it where when I change the skybox, it changes from like day to night and then um stormy clouds and stuff like that. So that helps enhance the environment, which I think would be cool. Um, other than that, everything is pretty good. Um, there is snow over there, but I'm sadly blocked by the doors of the of the gate. Um, I cannot show you exactly from over here because the doors are blocked. Um, but there is snow in snow forest. >> Okay, there's a couple things here. One, the Yeah, I recommend against this, right? Grass shouldn't be a picture of grass. It just ends up not looking correct, right? the picture of grass, it's it's as if it's all been stamped down. I think it's much more visually successful if this is just, you know, some variations in green um as opposed to a picture of grass. It doesn't No one no one is fooled by this anymore, right? Um >> did occasional toughs of >> Yeah. Yeah. that's a much more uh successful thing. But I mean, in this case, just having it be, you know, some, you know, dirtyish green texture. Um I think Yeah. Um then so are you jumping all the time when you're playing or is this >> um because it's jumping but it's not and then when it goes on it just normal. >> Yeah. Yeah. So in here save that one. Let's go to here and here. So, this needs to go I believe up is what we want here. Um, so find put your player in a place where there's a hill. Okay. And then try to adjust this to a level where they're not doing get getting the jump triggered. Also, double check and make sure that your terrain is on which layer? What layer should the terrain be on? >> Which layer? >> It's on ground. >> Okay. ground. Good. So, but this changing our slope angle um this I don't think is a thing. This one depending on where the collider is may also be an issue. But this one first. Okay. Try adjusting that to see if you can get not jumping all the time. Sound good? All right, it's coming along. But yeah, the green there. Uh, also it doesn't look like when you picked up the things that the number went up in the collection. >> I didn't yet. >> Okay. Yeah. So, that that should be where where you gonna how are you going to hook that up? >> Well, no. The canvas is set up. It's on screen, right? you've got it and you've got the collection manager thing up there. It's just that when you pick up the thing, you need to tell the collection manager that you got you got one, right? So, in the pickup, you need to use the event to talk to the collection manager. Is it still called increment? Increment. Yeah. Okay.",
    "transcript_segment": "here's Adrian. Hello, my name is Adrian Agula and um this is my um priv and uh on the particles too on my game. Here we go. We have to wait for the stuff to load. Um, I was able to get a fire asset for um, torches and stuff like that. Um, I was able to make a big old forest. Let's go, shall we? I do have to put the mesh colliders or renderers. >> Okay. Should you put a mesh collider on the tree is my question to you. >> Okay. I would try to get away with a box because there's so many trees, right? Like just something because your your character probably I don't think is jumping up into the canopy of the trees, right? And so we just need them to not run into the trunk of the tree. And so with so many trees, yeah, just um a box would be I think the the better way to go there. >> And then over here, >> right, all the other scenes we're doing before were small, right? And so now, especially with forests, lot of objects. And so now the tiny tiny performance losses that were kind of insignificant before because we just had like three objects now matter because we have like a 100 objects. >> Here um is the collectibles. I don't know why but the doors open even if I'm not there. Um, and that once I go in, then the doors actually close for some reason. Like it's reverse for some reason. I don't know. >> Do you show us that object >> the the door? Yeah. >> Okay. Uh, post a screenshot of that if you can. I mean, if the doors are opening when you're not there, either the trigger is not set to only look for the player tag. That might be a possibility, right? Um, is it a input? Is it a trigger zone that the character is supposed to walk into? >> Yeah, input trigger zone. By default, that's set to capital P player. So, it's possible your player is not tagged player. Uh, although that wouldn't mean it would automatically do it without that. And the other thing is that if depending on how you're animating the doors opening, did you do it with the animator tour or the script? >> Okay, then that may be set to just play on awake. Um remember with the anime tour right the using the anime tour for door opening and things like that is you know a lot of you need to have the you know this is uh open and then you need to have your start um game enter. The game enter needs to go to a stop state and then uh you need to play open and then open needs to go to a stay open state, right? There's just a lot of stuff to manage there. And so it may be in your interest to use the script there. It's part of the reason I made the script is for these simpler animation situations so you don't have to have you're not managing six states in a state machine to get the door to open and close. I did double check and did a lot of stuff. I don't know why it's like this. Um I do have to put um colliders for some reason. I don't know why they're not working. Um here are the collectibles, which is some spirits. You collect them and you go up and stuff like that. I might um add some for the alpha. I might add like a just a simple like go around the forest, collect these spirits, and then you win once you go into the mines where it goes to this cave to this dragon. Yeah, there will be a dragon. Just uh I might not model the dragon because it's going to be maybe really too difficult and complicated to model. Um to model, not to model exactly, but to rig it because I do not know how to rig. um exactly anything. Um because I did try rigging um on my own time and I failed horribly. Um and I don't know how to rig like animals and stuff like that. Um but other than that, there will be a dragon in here. Um other than that, I was able to add like rain. I don't know where the rain went. Um I was able to add rain. Oh, there's the rain. Rain. Um I will add thunder. Um, >> so is it one gigantic rain that's over the entire scene? Okay, so we talked about that having the rain like the Charlie Brown paradigm, right? It's like a smaller rain that's a child of or constrained to the player and follows the player around. Um, as long as you have the what's the most important um, particle parameter there? >> Yeah, world space. And it's the listed as simulation space. And you want to set that to world, right? Because in order to have the rain, the the reason we're like, is it raining? Oh, it was rain. Oh, no, it's not raining. Oh, it's raining, right? Is because you have your huge rain area. And in order to actually make that seem dense enough, you would have to crank up the number of particles to, you know, a large number, right? And then how many of you only would be seeing some very small fraction of them at one time, right? There is I I don't know exactly what's happening behind the scenes. there is some sort of calling there and that it's not dumping a bunch of time into stuff that's not on screen. But nevertheless, in order to have it be somewhat closer here, like the particle system itself, you can put a constraint on it, right? So here, uh, right? So, uh, parent constraint, you could say I want this to follow the player, wherever the player is over here. I turn off the player in this one. Where is my player? I think this is just a whatever it is. Let's say that this thing is the player. And um you need to click that activate button and then it would follow the player around. And so you could make it smaller. But the the other setting I was telling you about which you should definitely write down is simulation space. Yep. And so world is going to be the key here. When it's local, that means like the raindrops would move with the player, which is going to look not right. Right. The raindrops, you want the raindrops to move independent of the player. >> I do want to like make it where when I change the skybox, it changes from like day to night and then um stormy clouds and stuff like that. So that helps enhance the environment, which I think would be cool. Um, other than that, everything is pretty good. Um, there is snow over there, but I'm sadly blocked by the doors of the of the gate. Um, I cannot show you exactly from over here because the doors are blocked. Um, but there is snow in snow forest. >> Okay, there's a couple things here. One, the Yeah, I recommend against this, right? Grass shouldn't be a picture of grass. It just ends up not looking correct, right? the picture of grass, it's it's as if it's all been stamped down. I think it's much more visually successful if this is just, you know, some variations in green um as opposed to a picture of grass. It doesn't No one no one is fooled by this anymore, right? Um >> did occasional toughs of >> Yeah. Yeah. that's a much more uh successful thing. But I mean, in this case, just having it be, you know, some, you know, dirtyish green texture. Um I think Yeah. Um then so are you jumping all the time when you're playing or is this >> um because it's jumping but it's not and then when it goes on it just normal. >> Yeah. Yeah. So in here save that one. Let's go to here and here. So, this needs to go I believe up is what we want here. Um, so find put your player in a place where there's a hill. Okay. And then try to adjust this to a level where they're not doing get getting the jump triggered. Also, double check and make sure that your terrain is on which layer? What layer should the terrain be on? >> Which layer? >> It's on ground. >> Okay. ground. Good. So, but this changing our slope angle um this I don't think is a thing. This one depending on where the collider is may also be an issue. But this one first. Okay. Try adjusting that to see if you can get not jumping all the time. Sound good? All right, it's coming along. But yeah, the green there. Uh, also it doesn't look like when you picked up the things that the number went up in the collection. >> I didn't yet. >> Okay. Yeah. So, that that should be where where you gonna how are you going to hook that up? >> Well, no. The canvas is set up. It's on screen, right? you've got it and you've got the collection manager thing up there. It's just that when you pick up the thing, you need to tell the collection manager that you got you got one, right? So, in the pickup, you need to use the event to talk to the collection manager. Is it still called increment? Increment. Yeah. Okay."

Yeah. And I'm I'm not sure how I'm going to use particles, but probably somehow because, yeah, since most of my game is inside like tunnels and rooms and stuff. Yeah. The only parts that are like outside of these like textures could work are the beginning and end which I could do could make at least fire energy or something like the end the game or or Yeah. >> Yeah. If the dust particles were emissive then you've got magic >> dust being important to this game. like dusty rooms. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Old stuff is dusty. >> Earth emissions or something. Yeah. So, got to do that. And yeah, I'll show where I'm at to my Unity game now. Yeah. So, last week I've added to that world. Like I shrunk it a little bit from last week because it was I'll admit pretty huge. I showed it last week, but it's still pretty big. And since I might still shrink it a little more like this part over here, I think this part of good size, but or all this area here, I'm going to shrink a little bit because yeah, there is only two weeks left and yeah, could take me some a lot of work. >> Okay, good. I was about to say that. I'm glad you said it. Okay. So the yeah I mean some of the decisions may not have you may may not have that room for that sort of quiet contemplation at this point. Um it's time for switching into the definitive swift and decisive action part of the semester >> for the next three weeks before >> the time for contemplation is over >> fulfilling all that space. Yeah, I just want to get doesn't really size isn't all the biggest things or want to get some good animation interactivity and just some so I might shrink it a little bit.

And then here I made this in Blender put textures on it and Substance Painter brought it in here. I did have like some issues the first time like bringing in the textures like so I decided to solve the issue by by exporting FBX FBX of the model from Substance Painter and then bring it in here and that helped fix my problem. >> Yeah. So I think the fundamental thing is whatever UVs you probably have the automatic UV checked in Substance Painter which is why it's changing the UVs every time you send something over there. So yeah, your workflow could just be always export the mesh from Substance Painter and that will that will work then at this point >> and also maybe try substance to auto. >> Yeah. Yeah. Unchecking that box at the beginning would also do it so that then you can just use the one from the UVs from Blender. Uh that's cool. Yeah. I mean I think the thing here is maybe put um like some music as a local 3D sound file close to the radio here. >> And if you did that you could have like little particle effect on the radio for like Yeah. Yeah. Like a soundwave kind of thing. Um Yeah, that'd be super cool. >> Yeah. It's basically going to be a radio. I plan to put like a 3D sound around it.

That's great. I mean, copy paste. Um, a bunch of them here. They give you a little bit more of an arcade. >> Yeah. See, old the old Donkey Kong game arcade game. Then that that was basically a sprite they put on of the actual like game itself. the picture I've actually took of one out in the real world and made a sprite of it and put it on here. Man, the 3D sound in here. Paint sound suitable for that arcade machine. is actually the same model. But yeah, this is more simple. Like the first one I when I had was having the issues with exporting the textures, I brought in this one, but then I figure out the issue and then brought in that second one. But I decided to keep that first one. So for something additional decor there, it's like a picture of like a our old arcade game from out in the real world as well. Sprite brought in I don't know if I don't think there's any point in really going down here because last week pretty much the same just with some colors. >> All right. Yeah. >> So, in terms of like populating the space here, I mean, you got the those assets are both cool. Um, yeah. I mean, duplicating the duplicates here could be a way to go, right? Make five games in a row and then put those under one um parent and then you can start to divide up the space there. So, it feels like more of a, you know, a, you know, like a space that makes sense, you know, like there's just so much space in there right now. Um, so I think it needs to go in one of two directions. Like either you populate it more, like duplicate what you've got quite a bit more to use those as like architectural structural elements in the in the space here. Um, or sort of double down on the amount of space that there is. you know, it's borderline on like a kind of strange liinal space kind of experience at this point.

So, I actually don't have much done since I'm a bit behind, but I managed to add some of my assets, some of which I'm too lazy to show right now. Um, as you can see, I added these rock things in like foreground. Okay. So, uh yeah, in let's see, I've been trying to uh make the lecture search algorithm a little bit more a little bit better. Let's see if I can use it. I think having all the time stamps listed would also be good. Um, yeah. So, last Wednesday would have been this day and yeah. So yeah, 11:26 right around here. You know, we were talking to Meline. Her thing is set up similarly where it's a 3D world, but the players primarily moving just in 2D. And so we went over setting up the camera. And you should set up your camera in a similar fashion here. I wanted to add a bit of depth and like layers to the game. I haven't done yet, but I'm going to add more of these in the background. That way, the rocks fade into the background and look more like the inside of a cave. Uh, I also finished my platforms. I made a few like different variants. I have a greenish one, a normal one, and then I have these ugly infected looking ones. Yeah. So, if the camera stayed parallel there on the side, I think those um Yeah, that would be what we're going for. >> I also updated my map a bit. I added these three new sections just like so you can like explore a bit more. I'm going to make it so that in order to access the next sections, you have to find the buttons in the new sections to open the gates, which I'll add eventually. Uh, as of now, that's all I have. I've been focusing more on making the assets than the interactive systems, though, I do eventually want to add the E to interact mechanic. Uh, I also want to add enemies. >> The what mechanic? >> Interact. >> Oh, okay. But I know I should be focusing on finishing what I have now. >> Yeah. Not making more sections of the game, right? Like reporting an official moratorium on that for everyone, including you, Amy. Um, yeah, this week, absolutely. Get the functionality in there so that there's time to ask the questions about that. that's not something that is going to be we need to use this format in terms of using the video to ask the question and we're running out of opportunities to do that um as opposed to the making of the assets which people everyone has a fairly decent handle on at this point. So so maybe shift gears. I still need to fix the colors on my character, which I kind of forgot how to, but I'll figure it out eventually. Um, oh yeah, I actually have a slight problem when playing. Um, so sometimes when I'm trying to jump on the like the boxes or objects, uh, my character won't be able to like move like forward. Like it's kind of like there's like a barrier. It's like it's not letting me move forward. Uh but like like sometimes I I can like go through it though if I go from like if I jump from the top. Um I checked it's not the box collider cuz it it's not like out. So I don't know. I'm not really sure what's up with that. Um anyway, that's pretty much all I have for now. Let's see. It looks like you're marking things ground. We just have that box selected most of the time. Um I thought there was a way to tell it to draw all colliders, but I'm forgetting. Okay. Yeah, that's that works. Just selecting everything would would reveal all of the colliders. And so that would be the first thing because probably if there's not something there blocking it, then really investigating the making sure that everything is labeled ground there. And then also making sure that your uh ground test is at the correct spot. right? So, ground check distance here extends a little bit below my character. And so when something labeled ground is intersecting with this collider, then that's when uh everything is working correctly. You're grounded and you can move there. So check that and also check all the colliders there. And then uh yeah, the camera situation is pretty easy. Uh we just I think we just started with a regular C camera and then we uh just use the follow position. >> Hi everybody. >> All right, Gavin's here virtually and physically now. Here. >> Um I have a lot to talk about, so I'm just going to start playing the game. So I've done a lot of work since the last time you guys have seen this. Um, I'll just talk about the particle systems first. We got the particle system right here for the cigar. Pretty easy to implement. Uh, well, actually, no, it wasn't at all. I don't know why I said that. It was kind of annoying. Um, and the when you move the camera, it slightly moves around, which is weird, but uh, I mean, overall though, it's not that. It It looks pretty good. >> Okay. Uh, I think you're close there on that. The It looks like it moves moves with the player. >> Yeah. >> Right. But I mean like even the smoke moves with the player. Let's see. >> If I change it to world, it doesn't >> it doesn't move with the player. >> Well, no. If I change it to world, the entire thing doesn't work. >> If I change it to world, it starts spawn basically. Yeah, it doesn't really move with the character. It just spawns particles and then as you're walking, there's like particle here, particle here, particle here. >> So, I like I wanted it to do that where it would actually like move around as you're walking around, but it didn't when I look worse. >> You increase the rate that it's >> Yeah. >> I don't know. I tried a lot of things. >> Let's see if we can make this character smoke. All right. So >> whatever that conraint >> okay so I would if you did something here I would put that back to 111. This is a little bit like Blender where scaling the entire thing is going to propagate down into strange values going down the you know like we want to make the if you want to make the particles smaller we change their start size. I wouldn't change the entire transform. So check that first thing. Uh, and then here if we want this to be smaller emission shape radius, bring that down to something like that. Okay. And now we want them to not live as long. And so five or something. Um, even less maybe.3. And if there are more of them, they'll kind of overlap here. Let's say and start speed, you know, give it some variation. And then start size just something smaller for now. Uh, okay. And then yeah, simulation space world. And so how does that go? But when we actually move this character around, we need to make it a child of the character. There we go. I'm so stressed out. I need to smoke all the time. >> So I I have a feeling. Do you do you remember if this is weird up here? >> I did this like a week ago. >> Yeah. So that that that's probably why the situation with the camera is strange when it moving around. And then Yeah. In order for it like that that's definitely a non-negotiable. want that there so it actually seems like it's, you know, coming out of that area. Um, yeah. So, it might be, you know, before you even bring in like the smoke sprite sheet and stuff, just try and get base particle kind of how you would want, then sub it in, right? Um, as opposed to starting with that from from the get-go. Yeah, because I mean I think it fits the look and feel here. Um, yeah, but as far as having it move with move in the world like like I mean smoke is particularly the look of it is indicative of this, right? Where, you know, you really trails the the thing that's are pretty easy to implement. Uh, well, actually, no, it wasn't at all. I don't know why I said that. It was kind of annoying. Um, and the when you move the camera, it slightly moves around, which is weird, but uh I mean overall though it's not that it it looks pretty good. I got the cloud uh particles surrounding the city here. Um, pretty simple. Uh, I used the texture sheet from the Unity site you showed us. And then I got particle system here for things you can talk to. Um, I don't know. I'll probably change this around a little bit more, but I do like this idea of yellow emissive things kind of showing you what you cannot do. Um, I I did a lot of world building stuff. I made a lot of snow, made street lights here. Um, I made the buildings completely modular, so I can change the windows around. Uh, >> cool. So, how how did you do the modular windows? >> Uh, uh, okay. So, I made one version that was lit and then one version that wasn't lit. And then I made I turned them into preab like sets of three so that it took less time. And then I made like four different buildings. So I made four different buildings, three different mediumiz. >> Cool. >> Yeah, that's definitely more than enough to make it, you know, it looks great now. like as a environment like yeah completely buy it as like a you know believable >> windows, doors, uh just everything. Uh got graffiti surrounding the area that you can go to. Then I set up dialogue stuff. Uh I still have to build a lot of the environment, but I got a lot of the main stuff down. And then I als Yeah, and I also have the snow particles falling down as well. Um, I made those pretty much the same way you showed us in uh in um the video lecture. Now, I also made some characters finally. Here's the first one. And uh I completely I modeled her myself completely uh texture all in Substance Painter myself. drew out the eyes in like Frieza, I think, and used the blink decal to make that work out. Um, super happy with how this turned out. And then also I have this snowman character over here. Oh yeah, and I got music. I got sound effects. I got jumping sound. I don't know if you can hear that. Well, the music is very powerful. Um, I even have like buzzing sounds on the lights. And here's the snowman. This is not This is This is a little little uh I don't know. I don't know. I don't I might change this in the future, but yeah, I still have to set up a lot of how the game's actually going to work. But I I wanted to focus on making a lot of the main assets that I can reuse. And I've pretty much done that at this point. Now, it just comes down to modeling a lot of the characters and then uh making like a few more buildings. I'm I'm going to have to scrap the idea of going inside buildings because it'll just take too much time, unfortunately. Also, anyway, um the reflection probe, I made a reflection probe here, uh and I wanted to use it for her, but when I clicked it and I baked the entire scene changed. Um I mean, to be honest, reflection probes aren't really that helpful for this anyway. there's not a lot of reflex reflective stuff around. Um, and you're not going to go really inside anywhere, but I would like it is weird that that happened. Like everything got darker and I think it made everything look nicer, but I don't know why it affected everything. Uh, and then yeah, the particle effects. Um, you know, we got that we got uh snow falling and um yeah, I guess that's it. Thanks. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, yours you can see into the distance there. We're talking about this with Adrian's about, you know, I mean, seems to be running fine right now in terms of like frame rate. So, as long as you know it doesn't start snowing a whole lot more. Um, seems to be okay there. And then yeah, if you do you have the snow set to die when it hits the ground under the collision node and so the the Yeah. So looking under the level and making sure there's not like 100 feet of it still doing snow. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I mean either just shorten the lifetime of the snow, that's the easiest thing. Or turn on that collision kill. um parameter it is. We actually talked about it earlier this morning, right? >> Okay. Yeah, you can you can find it there. The >> um well for the making making the backgrounds for the dialogue looks really great. However, >> yeah, the Uh yeah, having the dialogue text with center align rather than left align really doesn't look great with the boxes. And I think having the boxes looks great. Um, and so being able to either select that because the text is generated by the script here and there's not a current input for that. That may be as simple as just adding one line to the script. I'll look at that uh tomorrow and see what I could do there. Yeah. >> If I wanted to add for the text, would I have to have it switch between? >> I mean, the only formatting currently is just moving and then providing your own font. So, um, if you use the text Trying to remember all the options that got built in here. Yeah. So, action display text has all the fonting, all the formatting options, but the dialogue does not. So, I need to add those up here. So, um yeah, I'll look at that tomorrow. I don't think that'll be insanely difficult, a pain in the butt, but um we'll see. Uh and uh then instead of changing out the entire um package, you can use the same technique to change out one script. So, close Unity, delete that script, download the new script, put it in there, and open again, and then you all the new stuff without having to uh gamble on the rest of it. Uh there. So, so there's that. Um yeah, the other thing here is there's no shadows. So, do you have a directional like a sunlight? >> So, yes, I do. I turn the shadows offirect. It's supposed to be at night. >> Yeah, >> but I don't know why the lights of the other like the street lights don't give off shadows. >> Okay. Well, I mean, first of all, make sure that that's on. Uh there's a >> Yeah. So the default is this right? So again this is that what see >> I just remember what happened when I when I would turn on the street lights I made sure the shadows correct >> okay they're on soft shadows right now. >> Okay. >> But when I would do it to hard shadows the street lights wouldn't work at all. >> Okay. Did you put the light actually in the thing? >> I did and I made a trans I figured out how to make like a transparent m Yeah. >> And it I think it looks cool, but it also might be adjusting how the lights work. >> Yeah. Like the transparency for seeing things through the glass is gen that that that's how the transparency is designed to work. transparency and the idea that like there's a light source on the other side that shines through the glass is like not not usually going to work out of the box, right? And so the >> I mean you just want some like there's no shadows right now. So, so you set these to soft shadows and you're just not seeing them in the game. >> Yeah. >> Is the current status. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Even when I'm not in the game, I can't see them. There's just no shadows at all. >> Yeah. Okay. Do we see the scene view? No, we don't. This is just in game view. Um, >> scene at all. >> I mean, here. And then you go into the full screen. We see it at the end. Okay. Yeah, here we see it. And yeah, they're not they're not there either. Okay. So, uh, uh, yeah, this reflection probe is totally unnecessary. Like, like >> Yeah, like like asked for me to implement somewhere. >> I mean like something metallic, right? So >> like the entire scene changed. >> Yeah. So I mean that's related to what we talked about on Monday with the the light baking situation. I think when you hit bake it bakes all of the things. Uh but I'd have to look there. Um, yeah. I mean, yeah, it kind of has this flat look and yeah, something where it's going to be not only metallic, but like a smooth metallic thing. that's gonna matter um more the I guess the thing I would try first is positioning um see what if the light is just outside you know like on top of these um and in shadow see if the shadows appear then the is there a sound on each of these street lights >> there is there's there's a buzz >> for each one. >> Yes. >> Okay. >> It's a 3D sound. I don't know why I took the time to add. You can't even hear it at all. >> I mean, did you Is it Did you constrain it so it's very very close to the thing? >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Yeah. There's not like a constant buzzing entire time. >> Yeah. Um I mean, double check that so that's not trying to mix all of these at the same time. >> I don't think it is. >> Okay. When I play through the game, I only hear it when I walk next to them. >> Okay. Um yeah, maybe there's like a reflective trash can or something. But like in terms of for the woman on the street um character, then that's not doing anything there. >> Yeah. Yeah. the windows uh there actually for that. So we have this Um because I don't think we talked about this. I believe there's two models for this if I remember correctly over here. Right. So for the windows we're talking about or flat things. And so if there was a reflection probe here where everything Uh, There we go. Box projection. So especially for the windows here, right? So if that's now real time on awake every frame. Now we were to run this. Now we're getting some kind of reflection there in the windows. So like for the windows to work like that, you'd want to because by default it's doing does it even show us here what it does? Is still No, it's still visualized as a sphere. But um now like it'll be not trying to wrap spherical reflections on this flat window. So yeah, the Windows would be a good use for that, but checking this box in your case would be the thing to do there. And then yeah, if you're not gonna have I would first try uh to make a larger one that goes across the face of all the buildings there and see how that looks. Does that give me just enough you know action in the reflection so that you know like there's stuff changing in it um versus separate reflection probes for each one right because remember each reflection probe is actually like some array of other cameras like the game is being rerendered especially if you have it live every frame from you know like the main camera and those cameras right So this can be expensive and just having one, you know, that goes across to do something for that would be the better way to go there. But yeah, with the light, the shadows, um, let's keep going here and then I'll try to put up an example because the shadow thing is difficult. Uh, Unity does this callulling of the shadows. the it's in the render settings, but there's like no less than like five render settings windows. So if we go to project settings quality and then this again is the one that is currently being used. Right? So if you look for pipeline asset there may if you just search for that there'll be multiple things down here. We ran into this before with the decal. Right? And so if we double click on that one, it opens up that. And so here under shadows if Yeah. So this is the e the first box to explore. Okay. So what is going on here? Your minimum like again it needs to run real time. So the default settings tend to be aggressively efficient and so you know callulling you know not calculating shadows for stuff that is very far away the player doesn't see because that could be expensive slows slow the game down. Um and so that's what's going on here. But depending on what the scale of the game is there how big you ended up making the world whether it's actually like two scale or somehow you made it much much bigger. Right? If Mr. peppermint is actually like like 6 meters tall, right? And then that woman on the street is like 30 m tall or something like that. Um then this uh may need to go up. So that would be the first thing to check. Yes. >> Uh I mean, it's definitely possible, but let me think about what like what not rendered by the camera, but still casting a shadow or transparent >> like why why do you want this? >> Because it's an isometric game. If I have a roof, >> the roof will block the camera, but the roof needs to cast a shadow on the ground. So if the roof were a plane with back face culling, >> that's right. Yeah. >> Then that should work. >> Not a box like plane. Okay. And then this, if you have it set on those lights, is most likely the culprit here. Um, this should be where it's set for now. If this is low, does it do they totally go away or just get crummier? Like there they get sharper, but that's because it's not blurring them. So yeah, but again, don't search for asset. You have to go because there's multiple assets and you need to actually adjust the asset that you're using. And so edit project settings quality, then click on the asset. That opens up this. And then you can adjust the distance over here. Okay. And so then you know be looking in looking at the gain view because that's that's the distance that this is um calibrated from, right? Not just whatever random way you happen to be looking at it in the scene, right? Because the scene there's like some similar thing happening over here. Although, you know, it's just the working view. Who who cares? But over here, this is what you know the player's actually going to see. make sense. And then yeah, the I mean if it works having the light in there, great. If not, that's the next thing to try is like moving the light just outside the thing. Uh because yeah, it doesn't by default the glass isn't, you know, totally like real or glass for all the reasons that we've talked about previously. Okay, that's coming along. Cool. And then yeah, we want the text formatting for that so that you know you have this box and clearly we want to be able to left align the text so that that works graphic uh graphically with the box. Okay, Alicia's",
    "transcript_segment": "Amy's. >> Hello. So, I actually don't have much done since I'm a bit behind, but I managed to add some of my assets, some of which I'm too lazy to show right now. Um, as you can see, I added these rock things in like foreground. Okay. So, uh yeah, in let's see, I've been trying to uh make the lecture search algorithm a little bit more a little bit better. Let's see if I can use it. I think having all the time stamps listed would also be good. Um, yeah. So, last Wednesday would have been this day and yeah. So yeah, 11:26 right around here. You know, we were talking to Meline. Her thing is set up similarly where it's a 3D world, but the players primarily moving just in 2D. And so we went over setting up the camera. And you should set up your camera in a similar fashion here. I wanted to add a bit of depth and like layers to the game. I haven't done yet, but I'm going to add more of these in the background. That way, the rocks fade into the background and look more like the inside of a cave. Uh, I also finished my platforms. I made a few like different variants. I have a greenish one, a normal one, and then I have these ugly infected looking ones. Yeah. So, if the camera stayed parallel there on the side, I think those um Yeah, that would be what we're going for. >> I also updated my map a bit. I added these three new sections just like so you can like explore a bit more. I'm going to make it so that in order to access the next sections, you have to find the buttons in the new sections to open the gates, which I'll add eventually. Uh, as of now, that's all I have. I've been focusing more on making the assets than the interactive systems, though, I do eventually want to add the E to interact mechanic. Uh, I also want to add enemies. >> The what mechanic? >> Interact. >> Oh, okay. But I know I should be focusing on finishing what I have now. >> Yeah. Not making more sections of the game, right? Like reporting an official moratorium on that for everyone, including you, Amy. Um, yeah, this week, absolutely. Get the functionality in there so that there's time to ask the questions about that. that's not something that is going to be we need to use this format in terms of using the video to ask the question and we're running out of opportunities to do that um as opposed to the making of the assets which people everyone has a fairly decent handle on at this point. So so maybe shift gears. I still need to fix the colors on my character, which I kind of forgot how to, but I'll figure it out eventually. Um, oh yeah, I actually have a slight problem when playing. Um, so sometimes when I'm trying to jump on the like the boxes or objects, uh, my character won't be able to like move like forward. Like it's kind of like there's like a barrier. It's like it's not letting me move forward. Uh but like like sometimes I I can like go through it though if I go from like if I jump from the top. Um I checked it's not the box collider cuz it it's not like out. So I don't know. I'm not really sure what's up with that. Um anyway, that's pretty much all I have for now. Let's see. It looks like you're marking things ground. We just have that box selected most of the time. Um I thought there was a way to tell it to draw all colliders, but I'm forgetting. Okay. Yeah, that's that works. Just selecting everything would would reveal all of the colliders. And so that would be the first thing because probably if there's not something there blocking it, then really investigating the making sure that everything is labeled ground there. And then also making sure that your uh ground test is at the correct spot. right? So, ground check distance here extends a little bit below my character. And so when something labeled ground is intersecting with this collider, then that's when uh everything is working correctly. You're grounded and you can move there. So check that and also check all the colliders there. And then uh yeah, the camera situation is pretty easy. Uh we just I think we just started with a regular C camera and then we uh just use the follow position. >> Hi everybody. >> All right, Gavin's here virtually and physically now. Here. >> Um I have a lot to talk about, so I'm just going to start playing the game. So I've done a lot of work since the last time you guys have seen this. Um, I'll just talk about the particle systems first. We got the particle system right here for the cigar. Pretty easy to implement. Uh, well, actually, no, it wasn't at all. I don't know why I said that. It was kind of annoying. Um, and the when you move the camera, it slightly moves around, which is weird, but uh, I mean, overall though, it's not that. It It looks pretty good. >> Okay. Uh, I think you're close there on that. The It looks like it moves moves with the player. >> Yeah. >> Right. But I mean like even the smoke moves with the player. Let's see. >> If I change it to world, it doesn't >> it doesn't move with the player. >> Well, no. If I change it to world, the entire thing doesn't work. >> If I change it to world, it starts spawn basically. Yeah, it doesn't really move with the character. It just spawns particles and then as you're walking, there's like particle here, particle here, particle here. >> So, I like I wanted it to do that where it would actually like move around as you're walking around, but it didn't when I look worse. >> You increase the rate that it's >> Yeah. >> I don't know. I tried a lot of things. >> Let's see if we can make this character smoke. All right. So >> whatever that conraint >> okay so I would if you did something here I would put that back to 111. This is a little bit like Blender where scaling the entire thing is going to propagate down into strange values going down the you know like we want to make the if you want to make the particles smaller we change their start size. I wouldn't change the entire transform. So check that first thing. Uh, and then here if we want this to be smaller emission shape radius, bring that down to something like that. Okay. And now we want them to not live as long. And so five or something. Um, even less maybe.3. And if there are more of them, they'll kind of overlap here. Let's say and start speed, you know, give it some variation. And then start size just something smaller for now. Uh, okay. And then yeah, simulation space world. And so how does that go? But when we actually move this character around, we need to make it a child of the character. There we go. I'm so stressed out. I need to smoke all the time. >> So I I have a feeling. Do you do you remember if this is weird up here? >> I did this like a week ago. >> Yeah. So that that that's probably why the situation with the camera is strange when it moving around. And then Yeah. In order for it like that that's definitely a non-negotiable. want that there so it actually seems like it's, you know, coming out of that area. Um, yeah. So, it might be, you know, before you even bring in like the smoke sprite sheet and stuff, just try and get base particle kind of how you would want, then sub it in, right? Um, as opposed to starting with that from from the get-go. Yeah, because I mean I think it fits the look and feel here. Um, yeah, but as far as having it move with move in the world like like I mean smoke is particularly the look of it is indicative of this, right? Where, you know, you really trails the the thing that's are pretty easy to implement. Uh, well, actually, no, it wasn't at all. I don't know why I said that. It was kind of annoying. Um, and the when you move the camera, it slightly moves around, which is weird, but uh I mean overall though it's not that it it looks pretty good. I got the cloud uh particles surrounding the city here. Um, pretty simple. Uh, I used the texture sheet from the Unity site you showed us. And then I got particle system here for things you can talk to. Um, I don't know. I'll probably change this around a little bit more, but I do like this idea of yellow emissive things kind of showing you what you cannot do. Um, I I did a lot of world building stuff. I made a lot of snow, made street lights here. Um, I made the buildings completely modular, so I can change the windows around. Uh, >> cool. So, how how did you do the modular windows? >> Uh, uh, okay. So, I made one version that was lit and then one version that wasn't lit. And then I made I turned them into preab like sets of three so that it took less time. And then I made like four different buildings. So I made four different buildings, three different mediumiz. >> Cool. >> Yeah, that's definitely more than enough to make it, you know, it looks great now. like as a environment like yeah completely buy it as like a you know believable >> windows, doors, uh just everything. Uh got graffiti surrounding the area that you can go to. Then I set up dialogue stuff. Uh I still have to build a lot of the environment, but I got a lot of the main stuff down. And then I als Yeah, and I also have the snow particles falling down as well. Um, I made those pretty much the same way you showed us in uh in um the video lecture. Now, I also made some characters finally. Here's the first one. And uh I completely I modeled her myself completely uh texture all in Substance Painter myself. drew out the eyes in like Frieza, I think, and used the blink decal to make that work out. Um, super happy with how this turned out. And then also I have this snowman character over here. Oh yeah, and I got music. I got sound effects. I got jumping sound. I don't know if you can hear that. Well, the music is very powerful. Um, I even have like buzzing sounds on the lights. And here's the snowman. This is not This is This is a little little uh I don't know. I don't know. I don't I might change this in the future, but yeah, I still have to set up a lot of how the game's actually going to work. But I I wanted to focus on making a lot of the main assets that I can reuse. And I've pretty much done that at this point. Now, it just comes down to modeling a lot of the characters and then uh making like a few more buildings. I'm I'm going to have to scrap the idea of going inside buildings because it'll just take too much time, unfortunately. Also, anyway, um the reflection probe, I made a reflection probe here, uh and I wanted to use it for her, but when I clicked it and I baked the entire scene changed. Um I mean, to be honest, reflection probes aren't really that helpful for this anyway. there's not a lot of reflex reflective stuff around. Um, and you're not going to go really inside anywhere, but I would like it is weird that that happened. Like everything got darker and I think it made everything look nicer, but I don't know why it affected everything. Uh, and then yeah, the particle effects. Um, you know, we got that we got uh snow falling and um yeah, I guess that's it. Thanks. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, yours you can see into the distance there. We're talking about this with Adrian's about, you know, I mean, seems to be running fine right now in terms of like frame rate. So, as long as you know it doesn't start snowing a whole lot more. Um, seems to be okay there. And then yeah, if you do you have the snow set to die when it hits the ground under the collision node and so the the Yeah. So looking under the level and making sure there's not like 100 feet of it still doing snow. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I mean either just shorten the lifetime of the snow, that's the easiest thing. Or turn on that collision kill. um parameter it is.

You have to go because there's multiple assets and you need to actually adjust the asset that you're using. And so edit project settings quality, then click on the asset. That opens up this. And then you can adjust the distance over here. Okay. And so then you know be looking in looking at the gain view because that's that's the distance that this is um calibrated from, right? Not just whatever random way you happen to be looking at it in the scene, right? Because the scene there's like some similar thing happening over here. Although, you know, it's just the working view. Who who cares? But over here, this is what you know the player's actually going to see. make sense. And then yeah, the I mean if it works having the light in there, great. If not, that's the next thing to try is like moving the light just outside the thing. Uh because yeah, it doesn't by default the glass isn't, you know, totally like real or glass for all the reasons that we've talked about previously. Okay, that's coming along. Cool. And then yeah, we want the text formatting for that so that you know you have this box and clearly we want to be able to left align the text so that that works graphic uh graphically with the box. Okay, Alicia's"

    "search_text": "AVC200 December 03, 2025 Student Feedback: Alicia's Desert Driving Game Hello. This is my assignment for the week. Uh so I've implemented this gas station and the gas mechanic. So you see the gas percentage down here is going down. I'm stopping at a gas station. Uh if you're in the little green particle system, uh you get to fill up the gas and then once it runs out of gas, it disappears uh to specify, hey, it's out of gas. You stop filling up. Uh I still need to make adjustments to the the haboo. Um, so, uh, I've made adjustments to the the driving mechanics, so it's less slippery. You could still do some drifting, so you do have to still be careful. Um, and the gas at the bottom, uh, when you run out, you will stop. Uh, your car will stop like right now. So now you're stuck. And this would basically mean that the storm comes in and kills you. Uh so that that is what >> So what did you do there? Did you turn off the >> How did you make the car stop? >> Um in the car script. >> Okay, >> I have implemented. Um so going in here this gas station uh I modeled in Blender and painted in substance painter. Uh the substance or I have a gas station logic. So I have a radius. Uh this will adjust this uh the particle system radius um which is a little bit bigger to start with. Um, but it will it does get adjusted appropriately to the uh fillup radius. And then there's an amount of gas that the gas station contains. So I'm able to have if I have multiple gas stations, they could have different gas amounts. Uh they could have different flow rates. So I can make adjustments if it's taking too long to fill up. Uh just mess with that. And then just a bunch of of the objects that I need to make everything uh work together. I have a gas manager. um that I made. Uh it follows uh a lot of the the logic for the health uh just with gas. Um and uh I do have um logic for if you are um if I go to the drive um fixed update. So if it's detecting movement uh like acceleration uh it checks to see um if we have no gas. Uh but if we do have gas uh then it will uh check to see if the car is slowing down. If it's slowing down, we're not using gas. Uh so if it is um speeding up or it's the same speed, then it starts using gas. So that's uh my way of just trying to get that. >> Oh, sorry. You totally could coast into the gas station. >> Well, it won't start filling up. >> You have to be stopped to start getting gas. >> Oh, okay. >> That's a different check. This is for using gas. >> Okay. >> Gas is burning. >> Yeah. >> Working a little better. Uh so this particle system uh it is using a circle uh I reduce the thickness to zero so that it's only the edges. Uh I have it starting underneath. Uh I don't have the particle uh visible and I have a trail. Um, so I get that nice little like, hey, this is a area for you to stop in. Um, and I have some variation on the the lifetime. Uh, so those are my main uh changes. Um, as implemented before, I do have the hab. So, if I go press play again, you see the giant uh boob, all those particles, the dust. Uh there's a little bit of fire particles that you see in here that's been implemented previously. Um I feel like this is coming along. Um and I am extremely hopeful that I will have this in a playable state for next week. um add probably simple enemies. I don't know if I'll have time to model it, but uh that's the current idea. Uh yeah, thank you. >> And then I mean, do you want to put the character in the car? >> So my current idea, uh I need to model a turret, put that back, put it on the back. Razer's going to be on it. Razer will shoot ene They're going to be like aliens or bugs or something. Uh they'll just simple AI, they'll just like slowly approach the car. Uh the different branching paths like one's going to be like gas, one's going to be a lot of enemies. I don't know what like other variations, but like that's what my plan is right now. Uh so there's no enemy cars anymore just to make my life easier. I don't want to try to figure out driving mechanics for enemies. >> Yeah, you need to write a whole other script to make the enemy car move. where it's just like moving an enemy in a straight line. Yeah, the flashing is like really intense uh in terms of the danger part like um >> is there a way to see when the storm is closed before >> there's so there's a caution distance where it's telling you to And then there's the danger to get damage and that's what the >> I think I think the phrasing distance is a little bit confusing because it sounds like you're >> you basically are but you're at the edge of it but like when you're in the heart of it that's taking so much damage. >> I thinker like >> I mean it's just like a it's just like a big box that's moving >> forward, right? >> I think some sort of particle effect for like when like dust dust picking up as the storm gets closer. >> That that is the idea. Um right now I need to make it so that the logic controls right now. I got to go back to work on that logic. So yeah, I mean also just changing this to like brown I think you know like this the general sky color. I don't know like would make it seem I mean less defaulty and then um the because there's so much stuff around the fog setting in the environment I think might help get towards the look that you're after. Um, windows rendering lighting. No, really rendering. Where is this window? >> Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. I have it jammed over there. Okay. Um, Yeah. So, um, yeah, it doesn't go to the skybox by default, but there's so much stuff in your background that, you know, like that. Um, let's see. >> What is this? So this is in in the window rendering lighting and then environment tab. And so here's this is where you would change out the skybox. Did we do that Monday? Mon was that Monday? Yeah. And um into you know make your own brownish you know sky. And then yeah this is off by default. Um, >> is there a way to >> Yeah, the Yeah. So if you don't have a volume in here, it's using the default volume. The volume being just sort of where the different visual effects are applied. And so, um, volume, global volume, and then here you can create your own, um, effect stack. Just say new. Uh, and then, yeah, the effects are overrides. And over here, I mean, you want to make sure you have bloom, otherwise all that glowy stuff doesn't happen. Um, I thought we had one in here to overlay images, unless that's in a different space. That's that. Yeah. So, all of the comp kind of stuff that we've been doing in 240, a lot of that is here. Chromatic opberation, uh, basic Okay, cool. Um, >> I could have sworn there used to be one over here for just like 2D image over top of thing color lookup depth of field grading. So, I mean depending on what you want to do. Uh yeah. So instead of you know like the flashing Although routing a value to this, you'd have to look up the scripting documentation here because you have to grab this first. You can do it, but then uh this second that'd be a good script to have to be able to send values to these. >> I also just >> something else. Yeah, I mean that that's a that's a simpler solution for sure, but um yeah, just having other canvases that you just turn on and turn off would be that's the you know low hanging fruit way to take care of it. Um yeah. So the display image script um action display image because now this creates its own temporary canvas. And so anything that you'd want to have here just enabling this would be a way to do that as well. Yes, you should do that. >> I I I knew that you mentioned like some sort of event manager list, but I forgot where it was. So, when I was talking to my brothers, he was like, I can make one for you. Yeah. Action event sequencer. >> Do these names not make sense? >> Um, I think I expected it to be a game manager, so I wasn't looking for it in the right place. >> Okay. >> Yeah. Now there's like too many scripts. I exclusively use your script, >> right? I mean, that that's the idea. >> I know how to write my own, so I don't even >> existed. >> Yeah, I mean, you can do a lot of the simple things there, so you should be able to save yourself some time. But yeah, we don't have something for talking to the post-processing volume. But maybe that could be there. But I'll look at the fixing the dialogue thing first. Um, yeah. So, action event sequence allows you to just timed series of events. And from that, you can do cutscenes, sequence, any series of events that you want to just trigger off of one thing.

First, I fixed the default issue with Kyro's eye. So now they are not affected by the lighting system. I also added animation channel for the clothes on the mommy's eye. So now they glow. This is some of the particle system I have created for my game mostly torch with other colors. You can see here all the settings I'm using. I didn't use any reflection proof, but instead I started working on the UI of my game. This how it looks. I also add some dialog at the beginning to give some context to the player to what is happening. I enable the feature that lets the player click through the dialog so they can read everything at their own pace. as well as some dialogue here. And I probably also add some UI that appears here to show the player they can interact with this object. This how so far the particles looks here inside the pyramid. You can see here implemented the patrol system for the enemies. No spoil. those have particles when they are shooting. Let me show you. Right now have I have all my games interaction finish except for the checkpoint system. I having some problem with that one. So this this empty here they have an input checkpoint some that is turning to the checkpoint manager to save the players position. Here's the checkpoint manager. And then also have this other object here. We use an input trigger some that when the player is there calls to the sharepoint manager to restore the player's position. But then it doesn't work properly. Let me show you. So this is the checkpoint. If I go there, I think this mean it save my position. And then when I go to this one that's supposed to me on the checkpoint, this happened. Yeah, it puts me verbally like just for one frame I think and then just committing in the same place. >> Okay, something's conflicting there. I'll try and look at that tomorrow. Um yeah, so don't just leave that as is for now. Um certainly for this first playable game, you know, you're just going to have to be good. Um no checkpoints. Let me look at that. Yeah, there's something that's conflicting with something else. I actually don't know how to fix that. And yeah, that's the only thing I need to solve to finish the my game prototype. And yeah, that's all for this week. Thanks for watching. >> Cool. Yeah. Nice. Okay. So, the light baking stuff that we talked about in your level in particular could be good to use here. For instance, here, where was the one where I was doing that? Don't save this stuff. This one. Okay. Uh yeah. So we got baked lights, right? So, your this could be the um you you clearly put lights next to the torches, which that's 90% of it there, but then baking that um and then perhaps um you know using the lights on the particle system is going to give you some of that flickery uh if you added it in with that. So if there's a particle system here and then right this is only for things that look like they're inside Um, you need to give it a, you know, like light prefab. Um, so light point light and we'll make it like orang-ish. And can we turn it off by default? Maybe. Now if we come back here under lights, we say point light. And yeah, now ratio one, that means every particle gets a light. But there is a governor here like there is with the particles to make to save you from yourself. So you don't create a thousand light objects in this the game. Um so here you know putting it like 0.1 instead of just a little bit of that maybe. Yeah. And then if there's if you tell it to use the color, which it is by default, then it could, you know, it tints those as is. So, and they're not moving around quite as much. So, that that will give you a little bit of that flame flickeriness. um on those there. But uh keeping this ratio low, you know, like the base light from it being the baked light and then a little bit just a little touch of the real time light there will give you some of that flickeryness. Um does it let you put shadows on these? I forget. Yeah, it's not crazy. I mean, here in terms of optimizing the light, hard shadows, resolution low, right? This is the resolution. This is the other ca like other cameras essentially. In order to figure out where the shadows are going to be, you kind of need to not render like a camera, but look at the game, project into space from that point and figure out what you know gets oluded, save that to a texture, and that's what's used um for the shadowing. So, we can see that that does work to some extent there. So for yeah the light up effects, you know, using this in conjunction with the baked lighting really works there. Yeah, the baked lighting is going to make yours, you know, that extra level spookier there as you're moving in and out of this. And in fact, if the character uh if we make a Let's just leave it at that for now, okay? Without getting too much into the weeds there.

Okay, let's see how Gage is doing. >> Turn this up a little bit. Let's manage our things. Okay. Incremental step in my music video. Okay. So, you you're able to hear it and synchronize it in Blender. That's all you're interested in here. when you render it out, you know, even if you're not doing anything significant compwise in After Effects, you should take the movie and replace the I mean, you're not going to get any sound out of Blender. We're rendering an image sequence. The image sequence has no audio at all. It's just pictures, just a f pile of images. So, you'll take whatever your original audio edit was and put it on the timeline with the output in After Effects or if you want to do it in Premiere or some other program. I mean, you're just lining lining them up then even if you're not doing any comp or processing or anything else at that point. Yeah, we're not going to get audio out of Blender. So like how it sounds in Blender is irrelevant as long as you can just know the things are synchronized. Uh that's that's the main into the scene. So we can get kind of the visual representation of the lyrics. Okay, this is coming along. All right, so I guess I thought we were going to see someone on the operating table. Once we were into the doctor's room here, um yeah, I guess there there are Yeah, these are like suspended by something. I think like like this one works and then the the other person coming down works visually, but this one with the, you know, like clearly this is cut out of some other image. Like if you just did something here, so it wasn't clearly, you know, cropped out of like a different image there. I think that's all you would need there. Yeah, the I agree. I agree with that. Um because yeah, I sort of barely saw it. I mean, we're seeing all of the Blender control things which will not be there in the final render. So, that'll help some. And then, yeah, you are blurring this either in comp or in depth of field. And that helps us, you know, pay attention to this in the foreground. The foreground stage level stuff all seem to be appropriately kind of the the low res dithered sort of look. I mean, these look less dithered now than um the things that pop down later and the curtains and everything. So, so there's that. Um, yeah. Whatever you did to process those images, I feel like either you didn't do to these or that they're the processing just isn't as obvious there. But it is separated by some time. Let's see the thing sort of that is just following the camera. Um, but universal thing and it's not just tied down space of Blender to get quieter because it's farther away from the speaker. So, I'm not sure if there's a better way to Okay. So, the I I would say the overall thing here is like this has a lot more structure now. I think I get a much clearer vibe out as out as as what's what we're kind of going for here. Uh all of the stage stuff in order to I think read a little bit more. Um, if it all had a little bit of side to side rotation from the whatever the anchor point is up here, I think that would be an, you know, we don't need to do like a full-on physics sim of like a thing dropping down on a rope and all that business. Um, if it just came down and, you know, like a few of them maybe were doing a little bit of rotation back and forth in this way. A couple of them were doing a little bit of rotation back and forth in this way. like that would start to get to more of the puppet theater kind of look which I think you're going for. Um, and so that's the main thing about those parts. The camera movement here, I mean to some extent I think you need to sort of mirror what's going on with the music. And so we have this starting presentation with a longheld guitar chord, which I think works and lines up. And then we speed up when the editing and we're continuing camera movement during the part where the band kicks in. And then here at the end when we come back to the wide shot, you know, doing something here to keep the energy going because the the tune is still going quickly, but we're just here while these things sort of pop into frame. Um, you know, what can happen here to continue the energy match the energy of the music which is, you know, at 11 at this point. So, so there's that. Think think about think about that. Um, yeah. And then how does everyone feel about the medical room here? Any suggestions? A little >> I mean it really feels like a doctor's office now, but Um, yeah. I I'm I'm just a little little confused about where Right. Is this supposed to be intense spooky slashtraumatic doctor's office? Right. If so, it's not enough. I mean we have like skulls over here which is like not you know typical in a lot of offices. Um so yeah I mean again we we can do anything we want here in this environment and so doing the totally normal thing there should be a good reason for doing that in terms of like reimagining space here what what's going uh have a hanging skeleton that begins to move. Yeah. I mean, just feel free to not do any of this stuff, but like something here. The camera starts to really pick up the visual energy and moves around, but then you know what? if some of these implements were, you know, floating or just moving in space uh versus Yeah, I mean, I thought we were working towards it was going to get, you know, gorier. I'm not saying it has to get gorier. I'm just saying that like that's kind of I thought you were on your way there given the intensity of what's happening. Um, and so so there's that. Um, yeah, this thing if it's movable without having to like totally deconstruct it, you know, the light moving around at all those angles, that could really do something for the amount of visual action in the piece. if there's an actual light there shining out of the light mesh and this thing is moving around which is giving you moving light and moving shadows on all of these um creepy medical objects. That might be enough, right? In terms of uh what's happening there, I think it works now except for the bed. The bed looks bizarrely small comp. What's that? >> Oh, it also might be floating. That's >> it's hard to tell >> because like is everything floating. I mean check that. So yeah, I mean this like much this is much stronger statement and makes a lot more sense now just in terms of uh yeah doing something to sort of match the you know accumulating energy of the music edit that you've got there. And then yeah, in After Effects, you know, you'll bring in very at the very least you'll have your image sequence, which you'll make sure is running at the correct FPS in After Effects by matching the Blender FPS to the imported After Effects FPS. And then the easiest way to do it is rightclick and say new comp from selection, which will make sure that the comp is running at the same FPS that you imported. and then you'll overlay your music track. There's a chance depending on the Blender playback that whatever you synchronized here doesn't match up 100% here. But now in After Effects, you could um time stretch, you know, right click, time, stretch uh this. And if you're bumping it by like three, four, five%, it's not going to be a big deal like so that it matches up for what's going. But you want to synchronize the visual to the sound. Don't try to smush the sound or anything. That's not I'm not even 100% sure if After Effects lets you do that, so don't do it. Uh,",

Maybe Angie cut her own music or No, I have this turned down here. Let's see. I mean, Angie, you wrote this, right? So, we shouldn't be up against the same thing here, but So, yeah, Angie, we're not hearing the soundtrack. I think you cut it out on purpose. >> Hey, everybody. I hope you can hear me. >> Now, we can. Yeah, >> I had to improvise with some other software that I am more familiar with. Um, but just because Blender just kept crashing. Literally, I had to save every move I made and it would still crash. So, I used other software that, you know, helped me get the job done. And I had to give up on some of my ideas, but I didn't have any any other problems with Blender other than it crashing. Here I have my sand sinking. And then morphing into a cloud. And and then clouds morphing into leaves falling and leaves will come crashing down and the watch will come with them and then fireflies and I don't have very many questions because I just did the best I could and I just want to move forward. >> Okay. I mean this is coming along the I mean did you check to make sure you don't have render kit installed anymore that was certainly increasing everybody's crashability right so we were using it earlier in the semester but for whatever the stability of it wasn't maintained so in your it would be under extensions render. Make sure render kit is not turned on here. That may be the main thing. I mean, the I feel like we had more animated stuff happening previously and less stock footage. the um even if you started to approach it, you know, like the I'm not sure how much you're putting into a blender one scene. Um that's the main issue. the comping some of the things together in whatever video editing software you're using here that you rendered out of Blender may be the way to um approach this. I mean, some of the animated movement here is still never been addressed in terms of like the actual like these things just kind of stop, which is strange. Um, but in smaller Blender files where we just have the watch in the fruit and you're exporting um a, you know, PNG sequence, that's going to give you a sequence with and as long as you have the transparent background box checked, which is somewhere. Yeah. Um, render settings, film, transparent. Then that's going to give you an image sequence of stuff that you can comp over top of other rendered elements. Um, yeah. So that would be my recommendation there. Um, yeah, because it definitely has like the stock footage kind of vibe to it. And like the the main thing with I mean even just rendering out you know your watch but spending the time to actually you know set some key frames on the um on the clock so that it animates you know um just a lot of visual comping but like the actual sequencing of elements and key framing of things on the timeline line. That part of it I think could be much much more thoroughly explored here. Um, yeah. I mean, does Blender crash if there's, you know, in just a blank Blender file just rendering the cube, are you crashing? Because then that allows you to answer the question like, okay, it's my configuration, it's my program, something with the computer, something like that, right? Versus uh you've been adding much much much more stuff. I don't know if that's a great decision artistically, right? Like a lot of these problems you've tried to solve by adding more things when I mean I think just the watch and the cloth is more than enough given the time frame to do something like a little bit more artistically stable with a little bit more. there's just sort of less on the table there because all the things you're trying to combine are all like separate systems which all require, you know, a ton of wrangling. You know, like the particle system doesn't interact with the physics simulation system by default until you, you know, do this and this and this and this and all these things just very wrangle intensive. as opposed to, you know, maybe going back and just with some basic key framing. How could how could these how could you create some elements that you could use in an artistic way in in the comp there in the actual editing of the uh of the sequence. But yeah, first you got to answer the question like does Blender work by itself? Are you on if you're on the newest one five which is literally like two weeks old or something, right? Checking 4.5, right? Because there's no we haven't necessarily done anything new in five. uh well like we like in class we haven't but um we're you know we've been working back and forth but that's certainly could be a cause or source of the instability there. Um I would give that a shot first. All right, here's Aaron.",

And like the the main thing with I mean even just rendering out you know your watch but spending the time to actually you know set some key frames on the um on the clock so that it animates you know um just a lot of visual comping but like the actual sequencing of elements and key framing of things on the timeline line. That part of it I think could be much much more thoroughly explored here. Um, yeah. I mean, does Blender crash if there's, you know, in just a blank Blender file just rendering the cube, are you crashing? Because then that allows you to answer the question like, okay, it's my configuration, it's my program, something with the computer, something like that, right? Versus uh you've been adding much much much more stuff. I don't know if that's a great decision artistically, right? Like a lot of these problems you've tried to solve by adding more things when I mean I think just the watch and the cloth is more than enough given the time frame to do something like a little bit more artistically stable with a little bit more. there's just sort of less on the table there because all the things you're trying to combine are all like separate systems which all require, you know, a ton of wrangling. You know, like the particle system doesn't interact with the physics simulation system by default until you, you know, do this and this and this and this and all these things just very wrangle intensive. as opposed to, you know, maybe going back and just with some basic key framing. How could how could these how could you create some elements that you could use in an artistic way in in the comp there in the actual editing of the uh of the sequence. But yeah, first you got to answer the question like does Blender work by itself? Are you on if you're on the newest one five which is literally like two weeks old or something, right? Checking 4.5, right? Because there's no we haven't necessarily done anything new in five. uh well like we like in class we haven't but um we're you know we've been working back and forth but that's certainly could be a cause or source of the instability there. Um I would give that a shot first. All right, here's Aaron."

And I also realized that I could make good use of the ocean modifier if it'll sorry pose mode. I realized I can make good use of the ocean modifier here on the river and I did so as you can see there. Uh and you can kind of see it in motion scrubbing the play head. just a bit. Uh, I also changed some of the shaders around, although not significantly, and in the other scene.

As you can see, right now they're just pointed upward to give them Okay. Yeah. I wasn't quite sure earlier whether all the villains had or whether everyone had shade smooth turned off which it seems like is true you know so it kind of has that low poly look which I think you're going for in terms of the style and it does look like that's the case the only issue is that like some of these I assume come from different sources so some of their polygonal densities are different. So they may look, you know, quoteunquote smoother just because there's more faces there on that thing than the other thing in Yeah. I mean, if they stay still um or you know they're not doing we're just sort of seeing them minimally, you can run the decimate modifier and with the shade smooth the shade flat turned on. that may make something that's, you know, higher poly look quoteunquote low poly and give you more of that low poly look. Um, yeah. And then, yeah, these hooded characters, we're not going to be wearing white, right? Let's just make sure that that's the case, you know, while you're doing your planning. Kind of an evil and imposing look. And other than that, I added some bevel modifiers to most of the subjects uh and the environments to kind of detail what the artistic intent for some of this is. I want everything to look less like low poly necessarily but more kind of rough paper craft. Okay. I mean so I think the low poly having low polies is still at the core of that and then in the materials roughness and some sort of you know noise on the um color channel. So no matter get rid of this here, go to the shader view and then you know regardless of what's coming in from the um color texture Maybe there's some version of some Yep. this down and then some noise. Uh that's, you know, just very very speckly. And then these are being mixed together going to here to make it look like, you know, construction paperish. But, you know, low roughness, some sort of noise added to that plus the low poly. And that that would be the simplest. Um, so I'm not sure what else I could do in pursuit of that. And for this last scene here, obviously it looked very rough in the last one and still does. Um, but if I go to the camera here in the last shot, it's supposed to be showing the protagonist walking down the hallway here in Beat the Song. And when he passes through the doorway here, there are going to be a few black frames as the model is swapped out with one in Rogues similar to uh the other characters here so that it looks like he's been converted to the cult here.

    "search_text": "AVC240 December 03, 2025 Student Feedback: Chain Physics Problem >> Hello. This is my assignment for the week. Uh changes that I've been working on for the music video is implementing physics for the chain. Um and here is got some nice slack going on. Um however I have a problem in that it is not um following but that's because animated isn't clicked and now that animated is clicked and you see the cache is being like whatever um it just falls away. Um and I can't figure out why. Um, >> have you changed the um steps? >> Yep. >> To a bigger number. >> Yep. >> Okay. >> I've tried uh repositioning um the if you if you look at the initial frame, there's plenty of room. I like the fact that when animated is off, it works perfectly fine. It confuses me. This is Blender 5. Uh, so I'm like I'm I'm turning this in uh this this Blender file uh for like help sake. Um, but I don't really know how to fix it. I looked at um the the lecture um and I was there in class. Uh but it I like I know we came across the same problem but it seemed to be a caching issue and that the cache is changing um like very clearly. Um and like this is like I did reposition all the chains and they're they're working. Um, how I got them to work is I had to make them a lot larger and then scale them down. It's the It was the only way I could get it to work on this scale. I I couldn't modify it. I couldn't make the chains larger to begin with. Um, so this was this is what I found out could work. If I made it too large, then it wouldn't fit in the existing scenes and I would have to do a lot of changes like scaling everything else up. >> Um, but I like e even uh if this is not um constrainted to the shackle um as as long as this is animated, it does not work. or it just like flies away. Like I I'm at a I'm at a loss for this. Uh I've spent it spent a while to like figure out how to make it so the change doesn't blow up. And that was the scaling. Um a lot of trial and error there. Uh this one I haven't modified yet. I'm just going to copy this and then put it on that side just to make it easier. But once this is figured out then um it'll be easy to update the music video. Uh next is I was working on so this is the the character that I am using uh for the dictator. Um and um one of the feedback I got was to try to make the other character look more like this. So I've been messing with the shaders more. So now we have it's still a little like the the cleavage there. You see like more shadow and like the the little elbow divot. Um so it's not like 100% but I feel it's a lot a lot better than before. Uh got the outline which was a really good suggestion. >> Do both these shaders work with the actual lights in the scene? I have not checked yet, but the there there's lights in this scene >> and and the lights change the surface of this character. >> Yeah. Okay. Like I I don't know if I spin around in this, but I spin around and it's darker on the back. >> Yeah. I mean, this feels like 90% of the way there. I mean the, you know, depending on what it looks like doing some rendered shots like the line weight feels like a little bit lighter here, but you know, like just make that a little bit thicker for here. You're using grease pencil to do the line. Yeah. And then the the only other like obvious thing is like those super hot highlight that's up here. And so like in the ramp that you're well, you have the shadow ramp that you're multiplying against the color, right? And so it could be yet another ramp that's uh black, black, black, black, black, a little bit of white at the end, whatever end. And then that could give you uh the super hot highlight at least for the hair. for the rest of it like you know whatever. Um and yeah, they look way more similar now for sure. >> Question. Um I can't I can't get the eye outline to work. Um which like this character has the eye outline. Um and that's what I've been spending. >> So >> his eye is weird. Okay. So, uh, a sphere, that's the white part, uh, I think cornea. Um, but they have like a clear part and then the pupil sits. So, like the pupil's like more 3Dish. Um, so because of that, I can't just have the outline on the pupil because it's being blocked by the opaque part of the I do show it more like I so um I just want to select both these. Uh so if I hide that, you see what the iris looks like. So, there's some it's like see-throughish kind of. Um, but it makes it I guess if I figure out where to put where this is, then I could theoretically put a line. Maybe I could just like hard draw a line on that. Oh, >> yeah. So that was my thinking is that in you know the grease pencil outline there's the outlines and then there's the mark what is it called mark uh no mark >> mark uh >> mark freestyle edge that if you mark something a freestyle edge in. Yeah. So I tab in here, right click and or no just I have this selected shift A and say grease pencil uh object line art. Uh look camera and then uh here here there um then subdivide all this and tap out. There we go. So now if I come back in and I select some edges that are not part of the outline, right click and say mark freestyle edge. Um does it do it by default? Yeah, it does it by default. So that probably requires a because it's a separate object probably requires a separate grease pencil line art object. But you know that that makes sense. That strikes me as the easiest uh course of action there. >> The grease pencil like I have a lot because I have to do that for all different body parts. >> Um, it's slowing down. >> Yeah, I would have that stuff turned off while you're working. Okay. >> Yeah, because it's got a >> like it's not it's like projecting it into space, figuring out where the edge is, creating, you know, vectorized edges, you know, like it's slow. like there there's no you know besides going in and doing you know shaderbased stuff which doesn't give you the same kind of like control over the lines there's like no other way to do it like in Cinema 4D the their system for this that I'm forgetting the name of now you know similar kind of thing very very very configurable but you know just slow because it's, you know, essentially drawing 2D outlines over top of each frame. So, yeah, definitely have it off, you know, have them in a section where you can turn them off while you're working, >> but it makes it simplify the eyebrows. >> That's it. >> Okay. And you're happy with the eyebrows? >> Yeah. >> Line. Yeah. the other uh let me open up my Blender 5. So yeah, there's not a lot of thrashing with the chains and so in Blender 5, the other way of doing the change chains is possible, which seems like maybe the better route at this point. um in terms of yeah like I feel like we've put the research into wrangling the physics and now like the physics system is like you know it's a you know the amount of time versus the amount of you know just pixels and detail this takes up in the project is disproportionate. Um, so yeah. So the one of the big things in five is the rewritten arrays. rewritten modifiers using geometry nodes. So, um, here we have this tab a shift D R Y. There we go. You get the idea. So, that's uh chain. Now, um, zoom out. Uh, shift a curve. Um, bezier and tab a delete. Okay. And now I can draw. I use this some sort of curve. And now tab back out. Grab the chain. On the chain I have to put, again, this is only in five. Uh, edit, generate array. And now the array does all the things that you would want it to do. You can say go to a curve just right here. You can tell it this curve and then um here you can I think you want it on count. It's facing the wrong direction. So come back here. Yeah. Let's see. There we go. Thank you. So, like that. Right. And so now it's on a curve. Uh and yeah, the next part of it is that you'd want to be able to, you know, animate the curve along to everything else. And so in the curve object itself, tab into edit mode and you can animate a point by creating a what Blender calls a hook, which is simply essentially just a constraint to a to a to an object. And so up here under uh yeah control points I mean edit mode on the curve hook hook to new object creates a new object and this could be uh end of chain and now uh that's there and tab back out and now I can animate this object and you know the chain moves. The only downside here is yeah, I mean it's not going to move too much having it in this mode. The um uh count means it's going to kind of compress and expand because it's going to keep the same number of chain links. And so as long as it doesn't stretch too far, I think it's fine. Um and you know then in order to get some chain swinging you could just again go back into the bezier tab tab select what you know your other point and again create another control point object and then tab back out. And so here um that's that one that's that one. Right. And so, yeah, if this were just covered up there, I don't think we'd see a lot of the compression and expansion. Or if there was just now there's a pile chain there, that would probably be the easiest one. Yeah. And especially because I think, you know, like most of your shots, we're just kind of seeing like this much of it. You know, we're not seeing like the whole thing. Uh, but this then is going to be, you know, this is an object and you can just animate it like you would animate any other object, right? So if I put this on and then hit space bar and G and then you know here's moving the chain around and now uh now I'm done. Uh so this seems like a better uh process there. Uh yeah, I mean what you're doing here the I think you could get a pretty convincing um reasonably convincing technique if you kind of just employed a super simple version of what the physics are doing. You know, like it's some sort of movement here that travels down the length of the curve or spline. And so if you animated both of them at the same time like this and did whatever and then came in and just simply grabbed the second one and uh bumped it over in time. Um, and so like there's that one and this one and you know now this on something happens over there and then it ripples down to the other one. I think that's enough like again it's not a it's not the star of the shot you know like pe like people will be looking at the face of the character that's what people will look at. Um, so yeah, this this is, you know, like just in time for your music video. Here we get the release of this, right? Because you could array stuff onto a curve before, but it was like super wonky. Now it's like in the array. It's very easy. The only issue is this, you know, compression and expansion. I mean you can see the other if you choose the other mode here uh distance and then dial in whatever looks right it tries to make new ones too. Okay there it's doing it from the end. So when I was testing it yeah I think there is there is some sort of directionality to the curve in that like there's a first point and last point and I guess I might have drawn it this way and so when I had it in that mode it was like adding new links up here which is way more visually obvious but if it's doing it back here especially if that's covered up that's like not very obvious at all so maybe that's better but regardless it's totally independent of the um animation so that's pretty flexible there in that regard. So, so yeah, maybe yeah, draw make sure you draw the curve from you know like that holder thing uh and then go up. >> Yeah. Yeah, I think that's you know this when I initially was not enthusiastic about the idea of using the physics and then you know there's a lot of examples of people doing it but once again like we've all fallen victim to this as have I in terms of like the cherrypicked Blender uh tutorials where it's like yes under this very specific condition this does work well but the me the second I try to do anything different with it, you know, like gh not not so much. But that's just yeah, given the opportunity of like, do I want something to be direct drive? Meaning like I just key frame it. You could do anything with the chain just key framing it, right? Like then is the only obstacle is like you and getting the key frames right. Right. as opposed to the physics sim where it's just like the obstac it could be a mil a billion different things right so uh just you know relying on the animator skill set just ends up making more sense in that case yep and that was Alicia's loud We I apologize if it's a little low.

Um, so yeah. So the one of the big things in five is the rewritten arrays. rewritten modifiers using geometry nodes. So, um, here we have this tab a shift D R Y. There we go. You get the idea. So, that's uh chain. Now, um, zoom out. Uh, shift a curve. Um, bezier and tab a delete. Okay. And now I can draw. I use this some sort of curve. And now tab back out. Grab the chain. On the chain I have to put, again, this is only in five. Uh, edit, generate array. And now the array does all the things that you would want it to do. You can say go to a curve just right here. You can tell it this curve and then um here you can I think you want it on count. It's facing the wrong direction. So come back here. Yeah. Let's see. There we go. Thank you. So, like that. Right. And so now it's on a curve. Uh and yeah, the next part of it is that you'd want to be able to, you know, animate the curve along to everything else. And so in the curve object itself, tab into edit mode and you can animate a point by creating a what Blender calls a hook, which is simply essentially just a constraint to a to a to an object. And so up here under uh yeah control points I mean edit mode on the curve hook hook to new object creates a new object and this could be uh end of chain and now uh that's there and tab back out and now I can animate this object and you know the chain moves. The only downside here is yeah, I mean it's not going to move too much having it in this mode. The um uh count means it's going to kind of compress and expand because it's going to keep the same number of chain links. And so as long as it doesn't stretch too far, I think it's fine. Um and you know then in order to get some chain swinging you could just again go back into the bezier tab tab select what you know your other point and again create another control point object and then tab back out. And so here um that's that one that's that one. Right. And so, yeah, if this were just covered up there, I don't think we'd see a lot of the compression and expansion. Or if there was just now there's a pile chain there, that would probably be the easiest one. Yeah. And especially because I think, you know, like most of your shots, we're just kind of seeing like this much of it. You know, we're not seeing like the whole thing. Uh, but this then is going to be, you know, this is an object and you can just animate it like you would animate any other object, right? So if I put this on and then hit space bar and G and then you know here's moving the chain around and now uh now I'm done. Uh so this seems like a better uh process there. Uh yeah, I mean what you're doing here the I think you could get a pretty convincing um reasonably convincing technique if you kind of just employed a super simple version of what the physics are doing. You know, like it's some sort of movement here that travels down the length of the curve or spline. And so if you animated both of them at the same time like this and did whatever and then came in and just simply grabbed the second one and uh bumped it over in time. Um, and so like there's that one and this one and you know now this on something happens over there and then it ripples down to the other one. I think that's enough like again it's not a it's not the star of the shot you know like pe like people will be looking at the face of the character that's what people will look at. Um, so yeah, this this is, you know, like just in time for your music video. Here we get the release of this, right? Because you could array stuff onto a curve before, but it was like super wonky. Now it's like in the array. It's very easy. The only issue is this, you know, compression and expansion. I mean you can see the other if you choose the other mode here uh distance and then dial in whatever looks right it tries to make new ones too. Okay there it's doing it from the end. So when I was testing it yeah I think there is there is some sort of directionality to the curve in that like there's a first point and last point and I guess I might have drawn it this way and so when I had it in that mode it was like adding new links up here which is way more visually obvious but if it's doing it back here especially if that's covered up that's like not very obvious at all so maybe that's better but regardless it's totally independent of the um animation so that's pretty flexible there in that regard. So, so yeah, maybe yeah, draw make sure you draw the curve from you know like that holder thing uh and then go up. >> Yeah. Yeah, I think that's you know this when I initially was not enthusiastic about the idea of using the physics and then you know there's a lot of examples of people doing it but once again like we've all fallen victim to this as have I in terms of like the cherrypicked Blender uh tutorials where it's like yes under this very specific condition this does work well but the me the second I try to do anything different with it, you know, like gh not not so much. But that's just yeah, given the opportunity of like, do I want something to be direct drive? Meaning like I just key frame it. You could do anything with the chain just key framing it, right? Like then is the only obstacle is like you and getting the key frames right. Right. as opposed to the physics sim where it's just like the obstac it could be a mil a billion different things right so uh just you know relying on the animator skill set just ends up making more sense in that case yep and that was Alicia's loud We I apologize if it's a little low. Um"

    "search_text": "AVC240 December 03, 2025 Student Feedback: Club Dance Floor Scene I will be playing this is on. Um I didn't change too much other than just adding a couple more cameras for some scenes and then adding a bit more to the initial phone scene. I had trouble doing something with the screen saver thingy like when it turns on. Um I'm going to change that. I'm probably going to change the phone all together because I this is bully. um what do I call it? Like a holder. Um I just added like a bag and like I believe a cup there for now. Um yeah, let me just play real quick. just in case. Um, yeah, also I forgot the the lines here. Oh, wait for apparently not this scene. I thought I changed it. Apparently not. I apologize. I'll be fixing that soon. Um, sorry. Sorry. But the rest are crispier. Are are you talking about the the floor being the old floor in that other shot? Okay. Yeah, >> I did change. I just didn't render it. I thought I >> um I'll be fixing that one soon. I think I just that her movement's still janky. I forgot to add a bit more movement in there, but I did add like another angle right here, which I didn't intend for her to look like she's looking into the camera, which I thought was funny. Um so, more right here. Um, some things kind of break here and there for the bottle, but they're low poly, so what can I do? Um, but yeah, I'm going to be fixing that. I'm going to figure out what this is. Oh, I you know what? I do know what this is. I thought I deleted it. Okay. Um, I'm thinking of also adding um more to the phone, the initial phone right here. Um, well, it's all of them. It's a a meme for Leica. It's a horse. Oh. But then I was going to add something else here actually, but it didn't work out. Um, I think I just did the mapping a little bit wrong, so I couldn't resize it how I wanted. But I think I'm just going to make another phone all together and then texture that properly. You mean to put something on the screen there? >> Yeah, I was trying to do the lazy way. So, but drawing something with grease pencil again or >> No, I was bringing in like another drawing like there, but it didn't >> didn't work. Okay. Um, and then for the post-processing, I'm think I'm going to try to doing like with the EXR method that um to have them the different channels and everything for I can add the shadows to like um also I'm thinking of moving the camera like downwards where you can see the floorboard and then for the shadows on there like right here you can see it in a little bit post um the shadow channel I think kind of thing going on. I'm going to try doing that and then possibly making um I can't say the dang word but like how I did the lightning earlier but like hearts and stars for the background um as in like if there were neon lights just to have a little bit more to just having it very blank. I think that should be it. Sorry, I thought I changed this one. Um, I'll probably fix it by the time of class tomorrow because this is embarrassing, but sorry if you hear the dogs barking. I figured out what this was as well. Apparently, I didn't have the walls on in the render. It wasn't the normals or anything. It was on me. The lights were on and everything, but it was just this guy turned off. I'm probably going to add more lights so this doesn't look so empty as well. And tone this down a little bit. Um, but yeah, that should be everything. >> Yeah. I mean, she's supposed to be like in the club when she throws the phone, right? Because it kind of it kind of feels like she's in a different space just because it's like Yeah. Like there's no we don't see the lights moving around and and that kind of stuff. Um, so if you wanted if you know if that's what we want to have happen there, that would that would also, you know, give those shots a little bit more action happening there with the some sort of background, some sort of light and stuff. Um, yeah. I mean, the given the pace of the whole thing, I feel like, you know, there might be enough room for two like of the of the ball here. Like it it might be like the longest shot in the thing. Yeah. And and and yeah, you did add some camera movement, but it still seems like >> Yeah. Yeah. because it's not like uh Gauges where you know like you know the band's kicking off you know like you your tune is like you know like the same kind of vibe the whole time and so uh keeping the same matching that editing energy uh throughout the entire thing I think makes sense and what were you saying about hearts and stuff. >> Yeah, I want to say something else. I did the lighting earlier seme. >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think something like that would would work for sure. Um, >> yeah, because you're you're making all of this work and the what what are these actually? They're particles or >> it's all just the spotlight on the background wall or whatever. >> Yeah. Okay. Um, yeah, it's just that the edge of the spotlight is so well defined, you know. Um, yeah. I don't know. I I mean, it's part of the the look here. It's part of what we're seeing. Like I think the the lights look the best in the disco ball shot. Wherever that is. I can't seem to find it right now. Oh my gosh. There we go. >> Yeah. Like here where they're like a little bit softer on the edge and we see a little bit more like of this chromatic fringing on the edge of the lights there. Um, can you give the lights a color texture? We did that with the goos, but I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah. I I think more stuff in the background for sure. The um Sorry, sorry. But the rest are So, do the floor tiles animate >> they just stay lit up >> after the first >> they just stay. Yeah. I mean, it's it's such a big part of the visual identity here. And now that you you clean it up, it's at how does it work now that each one is a plane with a material or what? >> Like if they turn on or off. >> Okay. And so the so it's they all have the same shader material. And so what makes them different colors? >> But then what's feeding the color ramp? Why? Why do we get different values? >> Is it like a position? >> The what? Yeah, it's just such a big It takes up so much visual space in the project like trying to think about how these could blink in a way that's not going to require like a total rebuild of everything. Um, let me save this file. Save as here. Chain key frames. a shader. There's some sort of ramp with some colors in it like so. And like this. And and constant. So you have it's something like this, right? Okay. Um and then if this is going into here and then this is stronger and this is on and any minute now. There we go. Okay. And so, all right. And so, we'd want different colors. If I just control T, do I get those nodes? No. If I do this? Yeah. Um, So now now that there's what is the brick thing doing now that they're they're individual planes, right? Or is it all one plane? >> It's all one plane. Okay. Uh, is there a node or So the sign value gives us some sort of repeating over time, but we don't want it to be uh smooth on and off. We probably want it to be uh on off, right? And so in order to get change over time, this is that frame. So hashtag frame frame divided by 20. And so that should mean it animates when we hit play. There we go. uh by default the sine wave is going uh above and below zero like so and so hence we get this fade and then a period of black. Um but if we want it to be on and then off, we essentially need to you like here's the original one and it does this. uh we want it to do up and over. And so if we multiply it, you just get bigger amplitude something like this. And so if we multiply it first and then we run a clamp, meaning that like clamp to one, clamp to some other value, we can end up with what is essentially going to look like a square wave. I don't think there's a square wave out of the box here. Let's just double check before we do all this math. Square root not the same. Okay, but it's not that much math. Uh multiply by some big number and then clamp value. Uh, and now if we put that into there uh yeah so this gives us changing value. So this the shader that you already have this formula here right. So, and the thing that makes it actually animate is the fact that we put this in here, right? And so, the speed actually, if you put this in a separate node, it' probably just be a little bit easier. How do I delete this? Right click, delete driver. Right? That's a driver when you put some sort of script in the parameter. um if you just brought this out into a value so you have a separate thing to deal with. And so here hashtag frame uh there you go now. So just hashtag frame and then you can control the speed with a uh divide and not a color just a float. And so we take essentially this right. I don't know why they don't have a time node. This is essentially a time node. And so we take this and we divide it by whatever number we want. Not zero. Don't divide by zero. Right? That's always bad. Um, and so now the bigger the number, the slower that should go. So slow we can't even see it. There we go. on. He Yeah, that doesn't it's mixing it. There we go. We just need straight up math. There we go. Now it's doing what we want. We said the wrong node before. So the bigger the number, the slower it goes. The smaller number, the faster it goes. So this formula. And so here, this, you know, essentially is just doing this. You could insert this into a couple different places in your existing whatever you have existing going on there, right? So, uh, somewhere either this or, you know, multiply, you know, multiplying the emission strength essentially would, you know, get them to blink between black and this color or if you ran uh, yeah, I mean, that probably be the because you already have them at different colors and so this would do it. Yeah. See if you can incorporate this into what you already got there in terms of, you know, making them blink procedurally there. If you have a chance, send me the like a blend file with just your with just the floor on it or something. I can take a look. But inserting this like gives you procedural blinking without even having to set the key frames. You know like the main thing to adjust here is this one which is going to be the speed at which it blinks there. Yeah. Clamping at zero. Right. It wasn't in Blender that we ran into the negative HDR values. That was in Unity. But that avoids it anyway. So So there's that. Yeah. I think just because there's like so much going on, we see so much of the floor at all the time. Um, and if some of the some of the floor is dark, like I think that's the other part of it is like we even if this were like a light up floor, we would be seeing some of those spotlights on the floor and we don't really see those in this these shots when we're looking down. And so that would sort of make it, you know, continue to look like the same space. I think that kind of thing. >> And then I don't know. I mean, is there a reason why we don't see both characters at the same time? Yeah, I mean that that's the other thing that makes it seem more like a dance floor, right? If there's more dancers there. So depending on how Yeah. How much rec I mean is it all in one blend file or >> different? Yeah, I mean you you've definitely fulfilled the animatic and now you know you're at the point of like what can we do to incrementally, you know, make this more impactful at this point, right? Yeah. I mean, the animatic is just a starting point. You don't want to be It's not like anyone looks back and it's like, well, this is really great, but it's not what you originally said you were going to do. Um, for the most part. Cool. That's really coming along.",

Um the source is this plane right here. Um but I have the trans like it turned off to where you can't see it. You can only see the particles.

Yeah, with the dynamic paint canvas um with waves so that it creates the little wave effect um when the water actually makes contact. Still, this had to get subdivided a lot in order to make these little rain droplets look good. But I think with like the motion blur and everything, it looks really nice. Um the individual droplets are just isop isospheres with um less typology. So um you can't really you didn't have to make anything really teardrop shape because the motion blur just makes it look like rain. Anyway, overall I really like the way that the rain ended up looking. Um, here's the shaders back on. See, my main issue here is that um from the top down you can see it. So, this is one of my shots, but the other shot is it from like um this angle and it's zoomed in more like right here. And it's kind of hard to see um the actual ripples. So, I was wondering if there's a different way I should approach that so you can see the ripples better. Actually, if I see it from this side, I might change the shot to this side, I think, so you can see the ripples better. Something like this. Yeah, that actually looks kind of cool. Um, so I probably will change the shot for that. But for the actual video itself, it's pretty much the same just with the added rain bits. Um, I'll mute it more like version cuz it was just screen recordings of the camera itself. So now you have the rain bits in between. And what I think I'm actually going to do is I'm going to try um maybe to include like a firework type effect for here, maybe in the background. I don't know. I want to experiment more with like lighting and how the light will affect the water because I think that could look really cool. And then I'm going to be smoothing out the movement of the orbs. Yeah, there's my updated music video. Thank you. Okay, that's good. The Yeah, I mean, for next week, definitely render out the scenes, not just the screen recording, and put it on the timeline with the music because I feel like we still haven't seen that happen at this point, which just for timing sake, uh, would be good. the He did send me the blend file, which is great. Assuming this is what that is. We'll see here in a second. It is. Uh yeah, the thing that jumps out at me is perhaps having one of the pink orbs fly by the water. Uh because that if we get it set up right, that should give us plenty of reflection action to really see all that cool water rippling. Um, I'm gonna turn that off for a second. Okay. Um, okay. We're over here now. And let's look this way. What's the problem? Come on. Just have Photoshop and three copies of Blender open. Let's close some of this other stuff. There we go. All right, we're fine. So, I mean, you've got this stuff on the outside, but I'm not sure that's going to get reflected. If we just make a some kind of sphere. And if we were to put something on this, there we go. That has some kind of brightness. And part of this may be you don't have ray tracing turned on, which is possible. Yes. There we go. So now that is going to allow us to see a lot more of what's happening. Some crazy clitification happening here just in the viewport. I think because of the motion blur. Yeah. What? Okay. There's this whole thing. Is this in the HDR? I think it is. Yeah. So, you got this vapor wave thing, but none of it's showing up on the water. And in this case, you know, we're not going to see the background because you built this box around. I think that's a good idea. But if we were to rotate this. There we go. Right now, we can get, you know, a lot more reflective action happening on this water. Man, the motion blur is like crazy. Let me just turn that off. Uh, yeah. We did see a render of that, right? So, because the motion blur is helping out the raindrops, if it turns out that you can't do both things, right? Because you need the ray tracing in order for there to be some more actual, you know, reflection action on the water. But if that means that this you can't run the I mean in other instances it's just that the motion blur looks terrible in the viewport. It's looked fine on the renders. Um but if you just made the particles some sort of like just longer plane or longer cube. I think that would also do the job there rather than just you know spheres. But yeah, having I mean having one of the spheres there moving while that scene is happening I think really brings it together. In fact, this whole camera angle here could be I would do it maybe just from this view. And so this is control alt0. There we go. And then uh you know you can move the ball around and have it you know showing up in the reflections of what's happening and then just play with your HDR in order to actually get the kind of reflections that you want in the in the water there. Cool. Yeah, that's a good addition. The other, you know, you you've got to get it all on the timeline. I would really prioritize that this week. And then the other thing that sticks out is, you know, e even if our character is just laying there on the bed, I think, you know, some sort of head turn or very slight blink is going to help us not think that she's dead, right? Because she's laying perfectly still there, right? Some some kind of movement um is gonna, you know, communicate that, you know, she's just tired. um as opposed to compl completely frozen. But yeah, the visual color palette and everything I think is coming along and now that you can manipulate those things to get some reflection happening, I think that's all going to look a little bit better. But you got to get it all, you know, now now is the time to render out the EV passes. Get it all onto your proper After Effects timeline lined up with the music. so we can actually see how it all plays out. Um, but that's coming along. Great. Uh, Jack,",
    "transcript_segment": "and crimson >> simulations um to finally fill in those blank spots. So, here is what I got. Don't mind like all this around here. I just wanted to get the the pink kind of reflection lighting. So, let me go back to the beginning. I figured out um how to do some rain. Um the source is this plane right here. Um but I have the trans like it turned off to where you can't see it. You can only see the particles. Um, so we have the particle system all set up um with scale randomness just because I feel like it makes it look more interesting instead of it all being the same because obviously no raindrops are all going to be the same. Um, I also have motion blur on with the rain. So here is just it falling there with some motion blur. And actually, if I turn off the shading here, there you go. You can see it.

    "search_text": "AVC240 December 03, 2025 Student Feedback: Fireworks Explosion Effects >> hello. This is Jack with ABC240 and we're going to be taking a look at what we updated on our previs this week. So, I'm going to show the previs now. with. >> Um, yeah, I have a lot of issues with it because uh I I think it actually got worse. Yeah, I tried experimenting with bigger fireworks and I think it just looks tackier. Like they just look like they're closer now and like just looks like unrealistic. Um, I do like the >> I mean, did did everyone else feel that way? I thought the fireworks looked fine. >> I disagree. I already made my sentiment. >> What What were your sentiments? >> I disagree >> that that they were good. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like >> better. You think those are better than the ones previously? The previous ones are like smaller like considerably. >> This still seems >> Yeah. Like there still it doesn't re Yeah. I totally when watching it both on my phone and then seeing it here like it doesn't seem strange. they seem to work and they seem brighter and more, you know, impactful now. >> I think I just >> Yeah, I mean that's definitely a thing at this point, right? We've been working on this for a while and >> brightness I I changed the brightness of the fireworks, made them like twice as bright. Um, I think I do like that, but I might just go back to the previous size of the fireworks I had before. I didn't actually know what it would look like until after I rendered it and everything. in. Um, and I'm also not sure I feel with this yellow light. I might um make this like a little less aggressive like this. Also, I'm probably going to add like a bit of a delay between this turn off. Instead of it just being one frame, have like a couple frames where it kind of like slowly turns off. Um, what's wrong with the light? >> They'll turn on and they all turn off like in one frame on next frame off. I was like just like a little bit like two frames and then off just to have it be more like on off. >> Yeah, maybe. I mean that that's very subtle. I think the the motion blur which is on maybe essentially doing that already, right? Because it's like it is looking at whatever the previous frame was. So there is some sort of like breathing of the uh brightness stuff happening here. So um yeah I mean the they sync with the music now in a way that I think is pretty clear. Yeah. I mean, the having a car drive by strikes me as like like a more, you know, like that makes it feel like a totally real space. I mean, you already done a great job designing the space, but like that would be a much more impactful use of your time than micromanaging the, you know, two, you know, like one 24th of a second light change here. Um maybe varying the colors a little bit. >> That would be the other thing. Right. There's those lights >> over in Arcadia now that you know because they replaced um the city tried to replace all of the street lights with LEDs, but I guess the Yeah, the green because the I guess they're RGB LEDs and the green part like either burned out or doesn't work. And so now we like there's a bunch of these purple street lights. They're on Indian school. It's like Indian school in 24th Street, 36th Street, somewhere in there. But I mean it looks like like just like a Suns cross promotional, you know, thing which works, but you know like that it's it's funny. And then you like anecdotally I seem to have like a lot of LED light bulbs burn out. I don't know if it's just me. Is everyone else experiencing that? No, just me. All right. I felt like they were sold to me with this like you'll never have to change these light bulbs again for the rest of your life. And it turns out like I've had to change like a lot of them >> as well instead of it just being one frame. And then I made it so that these bulbs are actually turning on. Um definitely didn't do >> Yeah, it looks anything to the alarm. Nothing has changed about it. I'm just kidding. Yeah, so I made a new alarm. Yeah, I think it looks pretty good. Maybe it's too round. It's whatever. >> That That's the only thing I thought when I looked at it. Like I think they're more like like flat bowl >> this point. Um and yes, I added fireworks in indoors. And yeah, I'm I'm not sure how I feel about it either. I think having like smoke or something would really help. And I was going to try to add smoke, but yeah, it's uh 11:30 p.m. right now. So, um, yeah, let's, uh, let's tone it down a little bit. I do really like the light from the firework. It really makes this scene like way more dynamic. I mean, what's even going on here? I don't know. Yeah, I had to reanimate these cameras on these last two scenes because simulation like slightly changed, so I had to take different camera routes. Yeah. I also rendered this whole thing at 50% resolution because um I was really struggling to uh render it in time which So where is it at for per frame >> like on the it's really just like the forest I think like that first part is like 10 seconds probably frame but then on the team only like >> okay >> but besides adding a car I feel like the forest part, you could just sort of call it a day on that. And so, you know, you could just render when we pick up, you know, and just reuse the previous forest render, you know, you don't have to rerender the entire thing. >> Yeah. >> Obviously, it's not on time. I did want to take a look at like adding chromatic aberration like during this scene like during the bell have it like have it kind of emerge leading into these crazy scenes and then there'll be like really crazy chromatic aberration here and like just I think that would really add a lot of texture and flavor to this accentuate like that like distortion. Oh, and also yeah I took out the built-in camera blur here. going to try to do the depth passes for just this just so cuz I was having trouble tracking the blur like keeping this in focus while the camera's moving like it was very finicky and I think it'd be easier to do that in After Effects in Blender is that yeah it has to render out the scene each time so it's like you it's hard to tell like if if the depth of field you're seeing is like the final depth of field. Um, but so you want this shot to have more depth of field. >> It doesn't have any depth of field. >> Okay. Right. >> I want because the previous scene did the previous version did have depth of field. >> Okay. >> But the previous one you could like it was getting out of focus in focus as it was as >> I guess I could key it but I don't know like I did key frame it but it was just because the the motion is so like smooth that like I have to like have to put key frame like the same interpolation I guess kind of like >> I don't know >> yeah I mean having as long as it's not like crazy out of focus having things sort of drift in and out of focus here you know like I mean we're not fooling anyone to think think it's a real camera but it's going to make the just the you know the camera the cinematic perspective more real, you know, like that cuz Yeah, you you wouldn't Yeah. I mean, I don't know. That's It seems like a small detail. >> Something that did come up was that in Blender 5, they have they now have a depth pass as well as a mist pass. So, >> and what's the difference? >> I don't know. From what I saw, like the M pass is like what it was before. >> So, it's predefined. Then the death pass is more like it's based on distance from the camera like already sometime I don't know. >> Okay, >> I tried rendering it out and like the depth pass like had less contrast like gray but it did have like a range. >> Uhhuh. >> Right. Right. Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean well two things there. I mean, you could postprocess the depth pass to increase contrast and then feed it into your, you know, depth of field effect. So, there's that. And then, yeah, I don't know. Did you see anything about controlling the front and back point of the >> Yeah, I don't know. Okay. >> Just from like surgery, I think that is the difference is that you can decide in this guess. the difference. >> Okay, I'll I'll I'll try and look. I'll >> I don't know exactly what the difference is. I think I was seeing I think the mist pass is like more user defined like you can define the the distances whereas like the depth pass is like something more built in. I'm I'm not sure. So, I'd be curious to know about that. And also, yeah, I want to know how to maybe make these scenes better. You can like almost see the icospheres like they're like full shapes at this point. I really want to make it look more fireworky. Um, but I was able to get it to work, so that's nice. So, yeah, I do believe that is it. Thank you for watching and bye. >> I stopped it. >> Yeah, the the explosions look cool. So, you have a is there a light that's flashing? So, there's a light object that's flashing, >> there's a volume in the room, and then there's the particle system spewing out a burst of particles that then bounce around. Um, yeah, the I think the easy things here are yeah, they need to be smaller particles, right? Uh then um yeah, maybe they're smaller, but you crank the emission on them so that they're activating. Is there some sort of bloom or glow? Anything yet? >> Okay. So yeah, to get the glow around them, you know, making them actually smaller because, you know, like in when especially when they get closer to the camera, they do look like like glow balls and not pieces of firework. Um, and having them be smaller would be part of it. Um, there is this flash of light happening. Is that the only light in the scene for those shots? >> No, there's a sunlight outside and there's two lights. >> Okay. which I could probably get rid of this area. >> I I would I would look at that like what does it look like with just that because it's going to give you this really >> much more dynamic shadowing happening all over the room. And then you know even if because the relative brightness would be so different right of the firework going off inside you know like your you know like your eyes adjust exposure right and like so that you I think that would I think that might look better, right? If it's just that one light, you know, like there's explosion and then maybe those area lights are still there just so it doesn't totally drop the black, you know, but just like very faint faintly, >> you know. Um, >> yeah. I mean, I think just more contrast here is going to make these visual flashes way more impactful because you got them timed out with the music and everything and that's all that's all working for you. Um, yeah. And then I think you really need a sound effect of the everything falling >> to the floor, >> right? that I mean does that work in the sim like do they stop or is it still just like they're still >> so in the sim settings animating this up like once they fall and then in like a couple frames this gets jammed up. The dampening should stop things from moving. There's no damping that I saw on the world settings. Regody body world. Yeah, that'd be my first guess there because I think like having everything, you know, like lights come back on, everything falls to the floor, you know, and then maybe that gag of like then there's like I mean it seems like the bell should fall off the wall and and land on the floor at the end. >> Yeah. >> Or the clock or one of those things. I was thinking like something that's just like I don't know landed in some way or just like effort then one thing. >> Yeah. Yeah. It should be like everything falls to the floor and then there's a beat. >> Yeah. Like the music done but then yeah like the last thing falls over whatever that is whether it's the bell or the or the clock or something. Um yeah. Yeah. these smaller and then with the glow and then yeah the brighter more directional Right. disappear. It might be hard to see them smaller, but >> uh I'm not sure in this particle system. Let's see. Now, I think if you put key frames on the object, it would just all of them would Yeah, nothing sticks out there. It seems like maybe you can access something in the shader. I'll see if there's anything that's not, you know, like truly annoying to try and implement. Um, >> I mean it might just look better. >> Yeah, I think uh, you know, experimenting with some more post-processing stuff when stuff starts going off there. I like the idea of like a little more camera shake and now there's like a bunch more chromatic aberration. Maybe there's a little bit more lens distortion now happening with those shots. like all of that, you know, and maybe, you know, like the motion blur gets turned up so that things are like very streaky, you know, something something like that. Um, yeah, we did the thing where we imported the VDB, a static VDB. The shots are so quick that like maybe two VDB clouds just just animating their position might be enough to make like having those at the center. Um, >> I found Jenga there >> like a very like center point and like smoke coming out. >> Uhhuh. >> And I started download but then it was going to take like 30 minutes to download. So, >> but that might work. >> I I mean that was probably a VDB sequence. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So that's going to be like an like an VDB for each frame, which is probably why it was like >> like super large. Um, >> uh, see what it looks like when you download. If it is like a series of VDBs, just pick a frame where there's already some stuff and just put that one in. You know what I mean? Like um, because even if you did something with it, just probably scaling you know, um that might be enough, right? Because we're not sort of focusing on it, um versus having it play back, but it also might totally tank the render time. So, there's that. Um but it's worth it worth a shot there. See what that works. Yeah, not a good reference for people setting out fireworks inside. >> That's good. >> Here we go. Is this real? No AI generated. >> Yeah, like this, you know, like dent like the light inside the cloud, you know, like that. That's the thing that I think >> but then experimenting some more with the visual part of it, you know, like the Did you try running the particle system to a cryptomat? >> Oh, no. >> I mean, I would just try that to see if it works because then, you know, you might be able to do something with the trails of it a bit more. Um, something like that. But it's definitely like yeah like the sequencing everything you know that beginning forest sequence feels good you know like I would I would work on just the ending part here. Yeah the beginning fireworks look great in this case. Gavin is totally right.",

And yeah, I'm I'm not sure how I feel about it either. I think having like smoke or something would really help. And I was going to try to add smoke, but yeah, it's uh 11:30 p.m. right now. So, um, yeah, let's, uh, let's tone it down a little bit. I do really like the light from the firework. It really makes this scene like way more dynamic. I mean, what's even going on here? I don't know. Yeah, I had to reanimate these cameras on these last two scenes because simulation like slightly changed, so I had to take different camera routes. Yeah. I also rendered this whole thing at 50% resolution because um I was really struggling to uh render it in time which So where is it at for per frame >> like on the it's really just like the forest I think like that first part is like 10 seconds probably frame but then on the team only like >> okay >> but besides adding a car I feel like the forest part, you could just sort of call it a day on that. And so, you know, you could just render when we pick up, you know, and just reuse the previous forest render, you know, you don't have to rerender the entire thing. >> Yeah. >> Obviously, it's not on time. I did want to take a look at like adding chromatic aberration like during this scene like during the bell have it like have it kind of emerge leading into these crazy scenes and then there'll be like really crazy chromatic aberration here and like just I think that would really add a lot of texture and flavor to this accentuate like that like distortion. Oh, and also yeah I took out the built-in camera blur here. going to try to do the depth passes for just this just so cuz I was having trouble tracking the blur like keeping this in focus while the camera's moving like it was very finicky and I think it'd be easier to do that in After Effects in Blender is that yeah it has to render out the scene each time so it's like you it's hard to tell like if if the depth of field you're seeing is like the final depth of field. Um, but so you want this shot to have more depth of field. >> It doesn't have any depth of field. >> Okay. Right. >> I want because the previous scene did the previous version did have depth of field. >> Okay. >> But the previous one you could like it was getting out of focus in focus as it was as >> I guess I could key it but I don't know like I did key frame it but it was just because the the motion is so like smooth that like I have to like have to put key frame like the same interpolation I guess kind of like >> I don't know >> yeah I mean having as long as it's not like crazy out of focus having things sort of drift in and out of focus here you know like I mean we're not fooling anyone to think think it's a real camera but it's going to make the just the you know the camera the cinematic perspective more real, you know, like that cuz Yeah, you you wouldn't Yeah. I mean, I don't know. That's It seems like a small detail. >> Something that did come up was that in Blender 5, they have they now have a depth pass as well as a mist pass. So, >> and what's the difference? >> I don't know. From what I saw, like the M pass is like what it was before. >> So, it's predefined. Then the death pass is more like it's based on distance from the camera like already sometime I don't know. >> Okay, >> I tried rendering it out and like the depth pass like had less contrast like gray but it did have like a range. >> Uhhuh. >> Right. Right. Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean well two things there. I mean, you could postprocess the depth pass to increase contrast and then feed it into your, you know, depth of field effect. So, there's that. And then, yeah, I don't know. Did you see anything about controlling the front and back point of the >> Yeah, I don't know. Okay. >> Just from like surgery, I think that is the difference is that you can decide in this guess. the difference. >> Okay, I'll I'll I'll try and look. I'll >> I don't know exactly what the difference is. I think I was seeing I think the mist pass is like more user defined like you can define the the distances whereas like the depth pass is like something more built in. I'm I'm not sure. So, I'd be curious to know about that. And also, yeah, I want to know how to maybe make these scenes better. You can like almost see the icospheres like they're like full shapes at this point. I really want to make it look more fireworky. Um, but I was able to get it to work, so that's nice. So, yeah, I do believe that is it. Thank you for watching and bye. >> I stopped it. >> Yeah, the the explosions look cool. So, you have a is there a light that's flashing? So, there's a light object that's flashing, >> there's a volume in the room, and then there's the particle system spewing out a burst of particles that then bounce around. Um, yeah, the I think the easy things here are yeah, they need to be smaller particles, right? Uh then um yeah, maybe they're smaller, but you crank the emission on them so that they're activating. Is there some sort of bloom or glow? Anything yet? >> Okay. So yeah, to get the glow around them, you know, making them actually smaller because, you know, like in when especially when they get closer to the camera, they do look like like glow balls and not pieces of firework. Um, and having them be smaller would be part of it. Um, there is this flash of light happening. Is that the only light in the scene for those shots? >> No, there's a sunlight outside and there's two lights. >> Okay. which I could probably get rid of this area. >> I I would I would look at that like what does it look like with just that because it's going to give you this really >> much more dynamic shadowing happening all over the room. And then you know even if because the relative brightness would be so different right of the firework going off inside you know like your you know like your eyes adjust exposure right and like so that you I think that would I think that might look better, right? If it's just that one light, you know, like there's explosion and then maybe those area lights are still there just so it doesn't totally drop the black, you know, but just like very faint faintly, >> you know. Um, >> yeah. I mean, I think just more contrast here is going to make these visual flashes way more impactful because you got them timed out with the music and everything and that's all that's all working for you. Um, yeah. And then I think you really need a sound effect of the everything falling >> to the floor, >> right? that I mean does that work in the sim like do they stop or is it still just like they're still >> so in the sim settings animating this up like once they fall and then in like a couple frames this gets jammed up. The dampening should stop things from moving. There's no damping that I saw on the world settings. Regody body world. Yeah, that'd be my first guess there because I think like having everything, you know, like lights come back on, everything falls to the floor, you know, and then maybe that gag of like then there's like I mean it seems like the bell should fall off the wall and and land on the floor at the end. >> Yeah. >> Or the clock or one of those things. I was thinking like something that's just like I don't know landed in some way or just like effort then one thing. >> Yeah. Yeah. It should be like everything falls to the floor and then there's a beat. >> Yeah. Like the music done but then yeah like the last thing falls over whatever that is whether it's the bell or the or the clock or something. Um yeah. Yeah. these smaller and then with the glow and then yeah the brighter more directional Right. disappear. It might be hard to see them smaller, but >> uh I'm not sure in this particle system. Let's see. Now, I think if you put key frames on the object, it would just all of them would Yeah, nothing sticks out there. It seems like maybe you can access something in the shader. I'll see if there's anything that's not, you know, like truly annoying to try and implement. Um, >> I mean it might just look better. >> Yeah, I think uh, you know, experimenting with some more post-processing stuff when stuff starts going off there. I like the idea of like a little more camera shake and now there's like a bunch more chromatic aberration. Maybe there's a little bit more lens distortion now happening with those shots. like all of that, you know, and maybe, you know, like the motion blur gets turned up so that things are like very streaky, you know, something something like that. Um, yeah, we did the thing where we imported the VDB, a static VDB. The shots are so quick that like maybe two VDB clouds just just animating their position might be enough to make like having those at the center. Um, >> I found Jenga there >> like a very like center point and like smoke coming out. >> Uhhuh. >> And I started download but then it was going to take like 30 minutes to download. So, >> but that might work. >> I I mean that was probably a VDB sequence. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So that's going to be like an like an VDB for each frame, which is probably why it was like >> like super large. Um, >> uh, see what it looks like when you download. If it is like a series of VDBs, just pick a frame where there's already some stuff and just put that one in. You know what I mean? Like um, because even if you did something with it, just probably scaling you know, um that might be enough, right? Because we're not sort of focusing on it, um versus having it play back, but it also might totally tank the render time. So, there's that. Um but it's worth it worth a shot there. See what that works. Yeah, not a good reference for people setting out fireworks inside. >> That's good. >> Here we go. Is this real? No AI generated. >> Yeah, like this, you know, like dent like the light inside the cloud, you know, like that. That's the thing that I think >> but then experimenting some more with the visual part of it, you know, like the Did you try running the particle system to a cryptomat? >> Oh, no. >> I mean, I would just try that to see if it works because then, you know, you might be able to do something with the trails of it a bit more. Um, something like that. But it's definitely like yeah like the sequencing everything you know that beginning forest sequence feels good you know like I would I would work on just the ending part here. Yeah the beginning fireworks look great in this case. Gavin is totally right."

I just said in this case you're totally right. >> So I worked on my music video a little bit here. I'm just going to play it right now with the song. So, here you go. I mean, I did a lot of work last week on this like with in terms of camera movement And after our last discussion, you know, I had to decide basically which direction I wanted to take this in. I decided to make it a little more realistic cuz I felt it was already leaning in that direction. Anyway, so one of the first things I did was his shirt or his sorry his jacket. I mean, I actually added I made a texture and substance painter there. And I definitely think that helps. Um I like that fuzziness like that. it looks like to me. And I I still need to um by the way, I still need to finish fix this section, this this middle part here with this this last city scene. I still haven't implemented the jacket and I haven't implemented other stuff like cars in the background, which I need to do, which I will. But yeah, so yeah, you can see the jacket here. You can see there's actually right here there's someone walking here. someone walking, car passes by. Um, I added some trash. I added some puddles everywhere. Definitely. I think that made that more realistic. Uh, some of these lights on like the buildings here. And in this shot, you can see I made there's two different types. Like there's a dimmer version there. So, that's good. I think that helps. Um, I added uh some glimmers to his eyes in every shot just to make him look like he has a little bit more life in him. I think I forgot to do it here, but I don't think it matters that much here. Actually, I I it more so was for the shots where it's his face is in focus like this. Uh, and then other than that, yeah, B in here, uh, obviously I fixed the I forget what does he call this? I don't know. It's like the fuzzy stuff on a shirt. I figured out how to do that with, um, this nice thing you can do in Blender. You can just quickly add fur to something and then you can adjust it a bit. And I think it looks close enough to I mean, it look >> Yeah, it looks way more like lint than >> Yeah. than previously. >> Looks more like hay, but whatever. I think it looks I think it looks good enough. And it definitely looks better than how it looked before because it was like gray spears. Like that didn't look very good. And yeah, in here uh I tried to add I added some like noise textures to uh the wall texture and the floor. So that's why there's like little I I think it looks more like stains like these stains on the ground and then you can see kind of that on the wall as well. So I think that definitely helps add some and I also changed the door here because I thought it was too distracting for it and it didn't match. I think this matches better. And then obviously I added some posters on the walls. Some of this guy's favorite uh you know movies. And as you this is a Flight of the Concords. Uh you know Ted and you know Jack and Jill good great films. This guy's got a really good taste. Um yeah I don't know what all Wait, what else do I have to talk about? Yeah. Oh, and in the compositing, um, I added just a bit of grain, some and then a blur, and then sharpen, which is something I've learned that you can do to make it look a little more VHS like. I wanted to do that just cuz I don't know, it fit the funkiness of the song to me. I don't know. Anyway, that that's all I have. It's >> what people >> No, I realized though I made the one person's shirt color very similar by accident. I should probably change. >> Yeah, the the textures on the on it on the main character look look much better. Yeah, you got the buttons in there and Yeah, it's kind of a sport jacket. It's kind of a cardigan. It's kind of both. Um, yeah, the lighting, attention to detail. I mean, just making you like this bloom match. There it does. There it doesn't like these, you know. Um, and then yeah, that when he's walking across the street, he said there's some different stuff in the next version of that or like some cars and everything. Uh, this time just the last shot because it's the last shot. I don't know, maybe some slow camera movement here, you know, like zooming, not like hard zoom in the whole way up to his face, but just something. And then yeah, like um it it definitely looks you you've done the set dressing and now it reads as like crummy city apartment. Now, just the lighting, like I think if it were if it's possible maybe to reframe it so that like it's darker and we're getting some of this directional nighttime city light and he is positioned some way so that it's, you know, he so his face is still lit, but you know, we get this much more dynamic frame there. thought of another like could I have like the main light in his room like be flickering like it's about to die. >> Yeah. Throughout the whole thing I thought there could be more of that like if you have like some red and blue stuff going by like as if cops are just out of frame. >> Yeah. Yeah, like the the set the set design here I think is is good to go. It's just sort of like the lighting like this shot especially because it's the last one. We kind of come to rest on it. A little bit of movement here. Plus trying to make it really, you know, spend some time on the lighting here to really make it interesting. Some edge lighting on him. Some volutric lighting coming through the through the windows, you know, that kind of thing. So, the volutric lighting coming through the windows, you know, maybe the volume plus, you know, a light out here or perhaps the um blender comp effect, the god rays effect that, you know, allows you to put the directional light. That may be a more a shorter path to getting what you want in the room there. Um, yeah. Eviction notice under the door. Anybody else have any suggestions? >> Yeah, that was kind of hard. I was like, \"How do I make it look like someone's walking near him without them running into each other?\" >> Same with the car. Like when he's crossing the street, like when he's crossing the street, I should just make it like, \"Yeah, the car >> The shoes are extremely white and shiny.\" >> Yeah. >> Okay. He bought them after his phone. >> He sells his phone. I guess I didn't pick up on that part of the narrative. >> That is so fair. He's already sold everything. Okay. >> His most prized possession. Yes. >> I looked up a list of bad movies. I was like really just a really embarrassing like why would he own this poster?",

    "search_text": "AVC240 December 03, 2025 Color Correction and LUTs Right. So, the lummetry scopes here, we have this up so we can see what we're doing and that we can um know where we're at in terms of using the actual dynamic range of what's happening. And then sort of along the lines here, uh the we've sort of ad hoc grabbed some of the levels and um curves and other effects, but uh lummetry color is like a you know massive meta effect that has a bunch of essentially all of that in it. you know, like there's a handful of After Effects effects that are just you like like all of the stuff in one effect. And so if you uh throw that on here, you'll see there's like several sections uh for all of this. Uh, one of them being um LUTs, which is one way to sort of um easily apply a specific color response um to your to whatever it is you're doing in terms of color correction, right? um as opposed to going in and dialing it all in on your own. This is kind of um LUT is a look up table. And so essentially it's a a function uh where you know you're the red in your movie is doing this the L that a lot of them are reverse engineered from specific film stocks or specific camera sensors and the that camera sensor does if you feed it like linear red then it has certain natural places it amplifies and um decreases that over the um dynamic range of it, you know, like from the dark red to the bright red. And that happens per channel. And so the lookup table is like the um recording of that. And then if you take your footage and essentially, you know, bring this in and multiply your footage by the lookup table, it's a way to sort of adopt the look and feel of uh other film stocks, other film sensors, all those kind of things. Um there's this is in a standard format and you can load them in here uh this way. Yeah. And so if you have one here, let's see. in the chat. Thank you. Okay, here we go. All right. So, some of them are going to be essentially um color correction presets that different people have put together. Other ones are going to be specifically designed or captured to look like specific film stocks. But um for instance here if we come in and go to custom and navigate to this let's try blue hour. All right. And especially with the scope up here you can see what's happening to our given footage. Um so again using the EXR having the maximum amount dynamic range allows these to be sort of like maximally effective uh when you bring this in uh over there. And so, you know, color color correction is a deep separate thing. Uh, not one of my main things when, uh, I'm doing this. I'm usually using a lot as a starting point and then just doing some minor tweaking after that. Um, and making sure that you you're not blowing things out and you're not smooshing all the black tones. Uh, allow you enough room so that you can some leeway to move things later on. Um, so you can use the lummetric color. And the other thing to keep aware of in After Effects is that because we are working at the higher bit rate now, this little um number before the effect lets you know whether or not that effect is computationally going to work. It's going to be designed to actually take in 16 bit or 32-bit stuff. If you're doing the if you're rendering like I talked about rendering where you set this to half, right? Our open XR half, that's 16. And so that uh anything that's 16 and 32 is set up to actually process that. If you run it into some other effect, mo most of this has been or all of the after the contemporary After Effects stuff has been, you know, updated to use that. But a handful of these that are eight are going to uh you don't want to do that because that's going to truncate the bit depth that you've gone through a bunch of trouble to put into the actual render. Right? So it doesn't usually do that very gracefully. It just kind of like cuts off all the numbers that are over here after after the whatever bit cut off it is it's using. So keep that in mind. and using the lummetry color effect which is designed for, you know, 16 or 32 and essentially has all of the other stuff that you would need to use here in terms of curves and um levels, histogram, all that sort of thing. That's all here, right? There's even um you know, our vignette if we want to bring that in in either direction. Um trying to think of anybody's in particular. Not really. Um we talked about that last time, right, with the pinhole cameras in the vignette. That was in this class. Was it in this class? Right. So, you know, like the the darkening of the edges um may seem like kind of like a corny effect, but it, you know, that's actually coming from the start of photography, the simplest of cameras, where we have some sort of box like this, and then there's literally just a pinhole in the box and some sort of film or plate over here. And in those kind of cameras, there would be this natural darkening that would happen because there'd be more photons hitting the center than there would be the end. And so it's not like they were using the vignette as an artistic choice. It's like a it's built into the technique of the technology of early photography, right? um you know modern cameras the lens compensates for that in some way. Um but yeah uh there I'll see if I can find a reasonable source. There's um the Fresh Luts website where there's a bunch of um lookup tables, but that one you need to register for, but it doesn't cost anything. But it's yet another thing to register for. Um, and you know there's this handful of right these are all",
    "transcript_segment": "Right. So, the lummetry scopes here, we have this up so we can see what we're doing and that we can um know where we're at in terms of using the actual dynamic range of what's happening. And then sort of along the lines here, uh the we've sort of ad hoc grabbed some of the levels and um curves and other effects, but uh lummetry color is like a you know massive meta effect that has a bunch of essentially all of that in it. you know, like there's a handful of After Effects effects that are just you like like all of the stuff in one effect. And so if you uh throw that on here, you'll see there's like several sections uh for all of this. Uh, one of them being um LUTs, which is one way to sort of um easily apply a specific color response um to your to whatever it is you're doing in terms of color correction, right? um as opposed to going in and dialing it all in on your own. This is kind of um LUT is a look up table. And so essentially it's a a function uh where you know you're the red in your movie is doing this the L that a lot of them are reverse engineered from specific film stocks or specific camera sensors and the that camera sensor does if you feed it like linear red then it has certain natural places it amplifies and um decreases that over the um dynamic range of it, you know, like from the dark red to the bright red. And that happens per channel. And so the lookup table is like the um recording of that. And then if you take your footage and essentially, you know, bring this in and multiply your footage by the lookup table, it's a way to sort of adopt the look and feel of uh other film stocks, other film sensors, all those kind of things. Um there's this is in a standard format and you can load them in here uh this way. Yeah. And so if you have one here, let's see. in the chat. Thank you. Okay, here we go. All right. So, some of them are going to be essentially um color correction presets that different people have put together. Other ones are going to be specifically designed or captured to look like specific film stocks. But um for instance here if we come in and go to custom and navigate to this let's try blue hour. All right. And especially with the scope up here you can see what's happening to our given footage. Um so again using the EXR having the maximum amount dynamic range allows these to be sort of like maximally effective uh when you bring this in uh over there. And so, you know, color color correction is a deep separate thing. Uh, not one of my main things when, uh, I'm doing this. I'm usually using a lot as a starting point and then just doing some minor tweaking after that. Um, and making sure that you you're not blowing things out and you're not smooshing all the black tones. Uh, allow you enough room so that you can some leeway to move things later on. Um, so you can use the lummetric color. And the other thing to keep aware of in After Effects is that because we are working at the higher bit rate now, this little um number before the effect lets you know whether or not that effect is computationally going to work. It's going to be designed to actually take in 16 bit or 32-bit stuff. If you're doing the if you're rendering like I talked about rendering where you set this to half, right? Our open XR half, that's 16. And so that uh anything that's 16 and 32 is set up to actually process that. If you run it into some other effect, mo most of this has been or all of the after the contemporary After Effects stuff has been, you know, updated to use that. But a handful of these that are eight are going to uh you don't want to do that because that's going to truncate the bit depth that you've gone through a bunch of trouble to put into the actual render.

And so, especially if you're making sure it's in sync with the audio, but in terms of making 100% sure, selecting the audio, pressing L um opens up the stuff you need and ll gives you the waveform.

We're exporting the you know what I recommend is the EXR multi-channel EXR uh sequence and then using that here. Um, but it's important to know that you may not get it to line up exactly right because the uh After Effects timeline play head is quantized to frames and for most of us that's 24 fps and the audio is somewhere between 44,000 and 48,000. thousand uh second samples per second.

This is what they were talking about at the beginning where, you know, sometimes you go add to Media Encoder Q and either it won't open Media Encoder or just won't send the project over to Media Encoder or whatever. Um, the other workaround when that doesn't work is if you were to save this file, save as or just save, you can drag an after effects project into media encoder.

And down here, right, the main thing, what was the main parameter we used to make the candle look like wax suburface scattering, right? And that's not a Blender word. That's just a computer graphics word, right? The any any substance where light is going to come in and kind of like light it up. Um so any sort of organicish um material is going to have some degree of subsurface scattering.

I'm going to put a subdivision surface on it so that it smooths out a little bit. There. That's better. Um, now we need to be able to control the color up and down on this. So, we need a a gradient. So, let's bring in a gradient texture. And the big part of this in other programs you sort of control what direction the gradient goes here but here you need to put it in the correct space. And in this case I am going to make sure I'm going to actually bring the texture the principled BDSDF back here to get the gradient tuned. So it's a little easier to see what's happening. Right. So with the node wrangler installed, control T gives me the mapping and all of access to all the spaces. Remember we did pretty much did a whole class on the, you know, spatial to UV slashoutput of all of these different outputs here. And our generated is going to be our north south up here. And so if that is going to a some sort of ramp and just want it to be colors that we can easily see for right now. So I'll make it blue and uh pink and run this into here, this into there. There we go. So we have a linear gradient. That's what we want. And right now it actually the best way to represent this would be it going into the emissive because that's just going to give us the flat representation in space without the other stuff. So, if we were to put this into here, this into there. There we go. Now we can see a little bit more clearly what's going on. So, that's the generated space. What does object space look like? That's mostly blue. Yeah. So, pink on one side, blue on the other. And if I were to move these in, you'd see it start to get like a line in the middle there. So, this is a gradient that's mapped onto the space, but it's just facing the wrong direction. It's going well, wrong for us. It's going this way, and we need to go uh that way, right? So, we can rotate this on the I think we're going to rotate it on the Z. Let's put this I'm on scale. Let's keep the scale where it is. Let's rotate it. There we go. Boom. All right. And so now we have it correctly oriented. Right.

So the generated one is relative to the object. Um the object one is obviously relative to the object, but some of the other ones are relative to either the camera or the world space, right?

Although the relationship between the Fresnel number and then the position of the gradient nodes needs to be kind of just right to make it really obvious. But there you can kind of see, right? So this in this instance here, if I were to bring those in there, you can see it's blue in the core, pink on the sides, and it looks like that no matter where I move the camera to, right? And so it's essentially giving me a colorized visualization of the angle. I think about it like shooting a photon out of the camera and it hitting it. And the color kind of tells me whether the photon bounced off and came right back and like hit the camera or whether it bounced off and went off to the side. Obviously there's a whole gradation of bounces there and that's what the gradient, you know. So this makes a gradient and this makes a gradient. It's just that the you know organization and relationship of the gradient to the surface of the object is different. So with that in mind uh yeah the Fresnel value here uh is sort of how how much space we're going to get on the ramp. So, we'll use this to fade the essentially the alpha, but we don't have an alpha on a volume. We can just use it for the density.

Yeah, because it the the N the noodle here tells us, right? It's taking the RGB and putting it into scalar. So, it's just summing them all. Yeah. So, we need the color mix uh in the multiply and all ruined from this morning where we use the same multiply the same way. There we go. And this needs to be in multiply.

So, let's go back to here and we're going to point it at the camera. We'll give that a shot. So, if we constrain this so it looks at the camera over here, looking at the camera and the There we go. And it's not I'm not looking through the camera. Let's look through the camera. So, if I press zero, there we go. And then lock my view to the camera. Let's see negativex. Actually, I'm not sure what is. So, let's figure that out. I think the anchor point is like way down here. So, let's do that. Let's put the anchor point where it needs to go. Origins. There we go. Now, if we've got it and we tell it to be damp track to the camera here. We don't have an offset. I think this is what we want. So this is let's try locked track. So I'm going to dump damped track and go to locked track. tell it to go to camera again and move it. And that is doing what we would want. It's just the internal axis here is not if we rotate our gradient. end. There we go. So, yeah. um damped track, right? If we have an axis like this, it's going to take one of these and point it directly at whatever the target is here, right? And so that automatically means the other ones are going to change, right? Because they're all locked together. This locked track means that we keep the orientation but when we um rotate towards we only rotate on one axis right and so in this case this is doing what we want it rotates just around this in what in Blender's case is Z right um but in our track axis here this is yeah locked axis is Z rotate on the Y. So my the way I modeled it, the default values work out of the box there. You may have to pick a different track axis and lock axis depending on there. But yeah, that's useful there. And it also won't work if you're not looking through the camera. Just like the other constraints, if you're coming over here and not looking through the camera, you know, if you have this off and then start moving around, you can go to the side, right?

Let's um Okay, so now uh yeah, we've been assembling this just kind of putting stuff in the same scene to some extent. Uh let's look at how we could do this at least be aware of this in another way. So this can get overly complicated but the the simple version of it is that there is an asset do they call it asset browser what is their term it is asset >> library it's browser it's browser it says browser >> okay so browser uh their asset browser right and so what does this allow you to do allows you to bring in other stuff essentially um I'm working on building a bigger version of this everyone can have. But, uh, if we just go over there, uh, right now, by default, it has like the brush all the brush setting stuff in it and and some other new stuff here in in this new one. Um, and you you can get other assets and there'll be things in here and uh you can build your own libraries of stuff in here. And essentially you need to uh set a folder as your place where you're going to store assets. Then um you need to the confusing part is that um each asset needs to be you know stored in a blend file. You can have multiple individual assets per file um by marking the object. You can do it to other things like geometry node setups and materials and stuff, but you need to mark let's say the thing even less specific because it could be I think most things in the program uh as an asset. So that's the key there. And then once it's marked as an asset and the ass and the blend file is in the folder and you haven't moved the folder, then uh those things should show up in the asset browser. So uh with that in mind, let's mark the candle. So I am going to go back. I'm going to open the candle file. There we go. So, I have both of these open. Nope, just the one right now. Um, and so if I right uh actually I'm going to select everything first and then right click or maybe select this way and then right click and say right here mark as asset. that makes it a little, you know, the library book next to it. I don't think I want that. I think I just want the top one, actually. Yeah, because then it automatically put it on the stuff below. Okay. So, I've got that candle. That's step one. Now, save this. Okay, now going back to here, file or sorry, edit, preferences, back over to here. Nope, wrong window. That's OBS. This window, put that back. Okay. Uh, under file paths. Yeah. So you can have multiple things down here, but let's make one specific here on mine. So I would put this in a place that it's relatively stable on my computer. Um, and so I'm going to change this to my data drive under asset library. Okay. Right. And so that's there. And you can have multiple places, but for right now, I'm just going to make one. And I think we're good there. Now, I need to do the housekeeping of making sure that this is actually in that folder. And so, file, save as. There we go. Now it's in the asset library. And so if I go back and open Jack's thing again now. There we go. And then we look in our asset browser. There it is. Let's see. I think this is the top. So, this can go deeper in terms of the organization of the folders and everything like that. But now we've got everything here. If I were to bring this in this way, let's see. Yeah, it's just giving me the top thing. What is that? We're missing one step there in terms of the asset. I remember this being an issue before and then us having my memory gets hazy whether it was properly fixed or was a workaround. Let's just try one more simple thing and put it in a collection. So, I'm gonna close this one or just open the candle. And I'll make a new collection. Call this candle. Uh then put this in there. Uh unmark this. There we go. And then Blender has that weird thing where you can move the parent object down into a new um collection, but then the the child objects stay in the other collection, which I guess is like I don't know. I can't think of a single way you would ever want to do that, but you know, I just I'm not conceiving of their framing of this the correct, whatever way they are. Um, and so let's mark this as the asset and see if that works. I believe that's what we want to do. Okay. And so now if we save this up. There we go. Candle collection was saved. Um, I'm going to close this. And I'm going to make sure that that's the only thing in there just to keep things a little bit simpler. Like so. Here. And here. And get rid of this one. Okay. And then there we go. Let's look in there now.",
    "transcript_segment": "Wrong one here. Yeah, there we go. All right. Good. Cool. Okay. So, we've got a scene here. Let's come in and look through here. Let's um Okay, so now uh yeah, we've been assembling this just kind of putting stuff in the same scene to some extent. Uh let's look at how we could do this at least be aware of this in another way. So this can get overly complicated but the the simple version of it is that there is an asset do they call it asset browser what is their term it is asset >> library it's browser it's browser it says browser >> okay so browser uh their asset browser right and so what does this allow you to do allows you to bring in other stuff essentially um I'm working on building a bigger version of this everyone can have. But, uh, if we just go over there, uh, right now, by default, it has like the brush all the brush setting stuff in it and and some other new stuff here in in this new one. Um, and you you can get other assets and there'll be things in here and uh you can build your own libraries of stuff in here. And essentially you need to uh set a folder as your place where you're going to store assets. Then um you need to the confusing part is that um each asset needs to be you know stored in a blend file. You can have multiple individual assets per file um by marking the object. You can do it to other things like geometry node setups and materials and stuff, but you need to mark let's say the thing even less specific because it could be I think most things in the program uh as an asset. So that's the key there. And then once it's marked as an asset and the ass and the blend file is in the folder and you haven't moved the folder, then uh those things should show up in the asset browser. So uh with that in mind, let's mark the candle. So I am going to go back. I'm going to open the candle file. There we go. So, I have both of these open. Nope, just the one right now. Um, and so if I right uh actually I'm going to select everything first and then right click or maybe select this way and then right click and say right here mark as asset. that makes it a little, you know, the library book next to it. I don't think I want that. I think I just want the top one, actually. Yeah, because then it automatically put it on the stuff below. Okay. So, I've got that candle. That's step one. Now, save this. Okay, now going back to here, file or sorry, edit, preferences, back over to here. Nope, wrong window. That's OBS. This window, put that back. Okay. Uh, under file paths. Yeah. So you can have multiple things down here, but let's make one specific here on mine. So I would put this in a place that it's relatively stable on my computer. Um, and so I'm going to change this to my data drive under asset library. Okay. Right. And so that's there. And you can have multiple places, but for right now, I'm just going to make one. And I think we're good there. Now, I need to do the housekeeping of making sure that this is actually in that folder. And so, file, save as. There we go. Now it's in the asset library. And so if I go back and open Jack's thing again now. There we go. And then we look in our asset browser. There it is. Let's see. I think this is the top. So, this can go deeper in terms of the organization of the folders and everything like that. But now we've got everything here. If I were to bring this in this way, let's see. Yeah, it's just giving me the top thing. What is that? We're missing one step there in terms of the asset. I remember this being an issue before and then us having my memory gets hazy whether it was properly fixed or was a workaround. Let's just try one more simple thing and put it in a collection. So, I'm gonna close this one or just open the candle. And I'll make a new collection. Call this candle. Uh then put this in there. Uh unmark this. There we go. And then Blender has that weird thing where you can move the parent object down into a new um collection, but then the the child objects stay in the other collection, which I guess is like I don't know. I can't think of a single way you would ever want to do that, but you know, I just I'm not conceiving of their framing of this the correct, whatever way they are.

I think this node this node there's different modes on this node that change slightly from four right didn't this wasn't this without >> yeah yeah >> yeah separate node now right so directional blur lens dispersion right so all the after effects stuff, right? Or a lot of it here. And certainly works well with this. And then, yeah, some film grain at the very end here. We were to throw that on there. I guess this is something you can't just throw on. Let's see if there's any clues. Maybe this one doesn't calculate. Come on, Blender. Uh, everything is just coming up as a node part. Um, I think that's just because I'm on like a beta five. Check that when you get home. See if it works on your regular five. I I think I did that at least once on my home machine and it worked. Um I'm going to guess it might have to do with this. Let's see. And my guess I think might be right."

And so you can use this information for a lot of different things. Why is this chair black? No, that makes sense. It's the closest thing to the camera. Okay. Yeah. Um, so why go through this trouble? We can get a much cooler looking depth of field by using the depth of field effect. Uh, shift a what is it called again? Is it the bokea blur? Okay. Bokea blur. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So,"

Vocal blur is just going to blur everything with this, right? So, if you just need to create just out of focus background with nothing in focus or you're comping something else on top, but no. Okay. Defocus is what we've been looking for. >> Wasn't it this image? Image. There we go. This isn't doing what we want either. >> No, I mean, was it Am I just losing my mind here?

We would have to go to After Effects for that. I'll look that up. Anyways, you can see the different quality of blur here, right? Uh and then this, you know, this bokeh image is just this simple generator thing that, you know, gives you different bokeh shapes here. And you can change the roundness and then, you know, work on the shape of it here. Right? So this starts to give us, you know, much much different um out of focusness in the image, but the mask does not seem to be grabbing the mist pass in the way that we want here. Let me see if I can finish that.

Is there some difference here? Let's see. This is hooked up to here and here.

We want to talk about uh continue our VFX conversation. We did a whole thing on particles on uh Monday. I'll just do a little bit about shaders here today. Then we can talk a little bit about lighting. um beyond what we've already sort of discussed and whether or not you know is your game supposed to the big decision to make here is it supposed to look like it's inside or outside and there's some things you need to do beyond just the having lights in the game that could help this out. Uh then we'll do a little bit review here on building the game. Uh once again just to make sure that everybody's on key uh on point here and remember what I said previously about building the game. You know this will be what we want to have done you know at the latest by next Tuesday so everyone else can check it out in terms of your you know testable uh prototype. Uh but I would do a test build ASAP, right? Because again the building process is can be more fraught than just rendering, right? It's in terms of structuring your work. It's very similar to the other classes in that you work work work and then render and then you know maybe comp and save. But uh this has the added complexity of you know there's actually compiling of code here at this point and this could have some sort of other error um that you wouldn't run into just running the game. And the sooner you can uh produce this error so that if there is one you can post it on Discord and we can try and figure out what's happening. That would be the sooner the better there. Right. And just in general, right, like the as you're working here, trying to think about your work and um how would I say this? Like just like I I was saying about not adding a bunch of new things.

    "transcript_segment": "Let's talk about a few things here in terms of uh what do we want to talk about? We want to talk about uh continue our VFX conversation. We did a whole thing on particles on uh Monday. I'll just do a little bit about shaders here today. Then we can talk a little bit about lighting. um beyond what we've already sort of discussed and whether or not you know is your game supposed to the big decision to make here is it supposed to look like it's inside or outside and there's some things you need to do beyond just the having lights in the game that could help this out. Uh then we'll do a little bit review here on building the game. Uh once again just to make sure that everybody's on key uh on point here and remember what I said previously about building the game. You know this will be what we want to have done you know at the latest by next Tuesday so everyone else can check it out in terms of your you know testable uh prototype. Uh but I would do a test build ASAP, right? Because again the building process is can be more fraught than just rendering, right? It's in terms of structuring your work. It's very similar to the other classes in that you work work work and then render and then you know maybe comp and save. But uh this has the added complexity of you know there's actually compiling of code here at this point and this could have some sort of other error um that you wouldn't run into just running the game. And the sooner you can uh produce this error so that if there is one you can post it on Discord and we can try and figure out what's happening. That would be the sooner the better there. Right. And just in general, right, like the as you're working here, trying to think about your work and um how would I say this? Like just like I I was saying about not adding a bunch of new things. Um, don't try to uh don't explore the unknown here. Uh, as we get closer to the end of the semester, thinking about what you can do to improve what you have, but not trying to do it in some new way.

The waves need to ripple like waves do. Um, and so the material system as it is, um, you know, can take like an animated texture, but that's typically not the way to do this, right? Because, uh, for this type of thing, because we want to have something that's sort of like more or less infinitely animating, right?

We could use it you know virtually very similarly to the sort of like default use of the blender shading space. Um but uh well let's just do something like that. Like I'll come in here and I'll right click create node and I get you know very similar to the shift a menu and if I look for noise you know I have some noise here.

And so keep this in mind this is not like working in the editor where you know if you change you can change this at runtime and it will stick right because the you're editing a file right that this is true of all the assets. If you change an asset at runtime, then that's change for real. It's not a change in the game. Um, and so, uh, fortunately now when you click in here and you, if you're in this window and it's forward and you control S, it should, you'll see the asterisk will go away, it'll do some stuff and then it, you know, recompiles and shows you the actual code up there or the actual result, right? so we can see what's going on with this. Um, let me so that we can see the result more. I'm going to put this over here, I think, just with my limited space, you know, because you can scroll wheel in and out of this. And then there's also a preview down here which you can look at and you can right click and say change the preview um geometry and then this window you can also yeah you can make it bigger if you want. Uh great. Okay. But now we can see what's going on. So noise or if you have any sort of texture you just drag that texture in it appears as a texture 2D and then these outputs could be run into any sort of input uh again if I update then we see this entire spreadsheet over here. Okay so very those of you familiar with the blender uh nodal interfaces is very similar. Uh now with that in mind let's just talk a little bit about what the different colors are. are the different colors here are going to be different um forms of data. Right? So the down the part that is can be unclear about doing this kind of programming this nodalbased stuff is like uh what kind of noodle or cable is this right like the idea of like dragging information and routing it from here to here I think is fairly clear for most people but then there's the question of like what kind of information is this right because just in the real world right um the physicality of this is irritating but helpful in that, you know, you you can't really jam a USB cable into a wall outlet, right? I mean, if you really worked at it, possibly, but and so there's like this physical barrier keeping you from routing the wrong thing into the wrong thing. Here, it may or may not be doing it. So, three things. It's either going to be a scalar, which is just going to be one number, or RGB, which will be our red, green, and blue. You know, our three values in Unity, that's usually referred to as a vector three, meaning just three numbers together. or just like any other typical um graphics situation, you also have RGB where we have um four numbers that are together and they try to do a good job here in showing us this in that the yellow is going to be uh RGB, the you know sort of teal cyan color here is going to be just a scalar value. Um and then this down here, this is uh RGB, right? So we have RGB for the um color, the normal channel, and then the emission, right? Which is at base color, but then there's this other, you know, brightness value that we've talked about before, right? So there's like anything else, it gets more complicated, right? Is it just a color or is it a color with some sort of um HDR brightness? And then yeah another uh single value right? So one what what kind of a blue cyan one is just going to be one number uh you know vector three is going to be this yellow and the other one uh four is actually this pinkish color. Right? And it says it right there. Right? Usually when you bring in some sort of PNG it's going to have an RGBA. And so if you want to route all four of them together, you would take it from here. If you want to grab the individual channels, you would grab them from here. Uh, good. Okay. So, we can bring these in like so. Or bring in procedural noise. We'll do a little bit of noise here. But, um, if we were to let's do some simple calculation here. Like what if we wanted to make this brighter? So bring this out. Um the search here is pretty good. So what if we multiplied it? And so if I run this into here into here and now if I multiply it by zero. Um, the nice thing here, which doesn't happen in Blender by default, is that we can get this stepbystep visualization of what's happening, which is hopefully there's probably an add-on for it. I I have looked at it occasionally. Uh, also today, you know, Cyber Monday, if you've been looking at any Blender add-ons, the whole the whole site is, I mean, not the whole site, but there's a lot of stuff on sale, like serious sales. So, uh, if you were looking at any of those things, also the Unity asset store has a gigantic Cyber Monday sale. The here anything time zero is zero, right? And so when I save this, what color is this plane going to be? >> Black, right? Uh so if I control S okay, correctly predicted because now we're multiplying by zero. If we multiply by one, it just gives us the regular value. And now if I save this again, it updates over here and it looks like the huge and if I crank it up, you know, we're making everything brighter and it becomes brighter over there to some extent. the Okay, now let's look at uh this is great, but um in terms of your actual workflow, you",

Um just like we haven't been dropping back into C to make changes on like a regular basis based on how we're doing it because we're trying to work at the next level up. So, um it'd be great to be able to change these, you know, like in the editor over here. And you can do that over here. This is the uh inputs, right? And so you can make your own inputs, right? And so here you're putting on your tool designer hat like what controls uh would I need to use this thing on a regular basis? Right? And just like we've been learning all semester long, do you want to make a control for absolutely every parameter? No. How much complexity do you want? Just enough, right? To get the job done. enough so that you can explore what you want but not so much that it makes it um difficult to use. So for instance, if we want to control the number that this gets multiplied by here, I hit plus and we need to know what kind of number we want here or what kind of uh data type we want. And so remember our float here. So these words for us can be synonymous right scalar float essentially just one number. Um our vector three a lot of times our vector 3 this and this mathematically are very similar. But here, Unity treats it as a different data type so that it has an actual color inspector so that um you can pick the color like one would want to do often. Um and the other one we might use would be a texture 2D, which means you could, you know, swap out your, you know, the user could put in their own uh textures there. So, there's a lot of stuff here, but these would be our main ones I think we're going to use here. And so, not Jack or Alicia. What kind of data is this? Uh close getting closer. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So all all good guesses, right? Because it's a one. Booleans are either zero or ones. But when we were when I was scrubbing it here, you can see that it goes I should have done this and asked you what kind of data it was because then it's obvious that this has decimal points. And if it has decimal points, it is a float, right? Um, and so I want to be able to do this in just regular usage without having to be in shader graph. And so I hit plus, made a new float. I double click and I can label this. And I can call this like, you know, surface brightness. As per usual, when you're coming up with your own names for things, um, don't use spaces. And now how do I get this into here is that once you make you know a slot for a new input you can click drag it over and now this is you know essentially where you access that info. And so you can run that info into here. We can save this thing. And now if I were to just come over here and select this and then double click on water. Now our you know you'll notice that this material it looks way simpler than our other materials because it's like a total blank slate, right? All the other stuff had inputs that were already configured that we were using here. Um it just has this one input that we've configured, right? And so now I can grab this and um you know use it as an input here. Uh so we have that. Uh let's come back over here. Make sense so far? Questions? People on the left on my left. Good. Okay. Um great. So, we've got this set up. Let's take this a bit a bit further. I'm going to replace the simple noise. Um, again, you have to rightclick, create node. Um, and we'll go with uh yeah, gradient noise is more of a pear pear and noise kind of thing. And so if I were to route that in there like so, um, also in in the input, sorry, in the input, if you select the input up here, there's the default, uh, you can configure this input, right? And so what should the default value be? Right? You've heard me complain about this viciferously throughout the semester, mad at other people for putting the wrong defaults in there, which either show you nothing or don't show don't, you know, like you load it up and it doesn't do anything because all the defaults are not configured. So take some time to think about this kind of thing. In this case, having it be one rather than zero. If it's zero, no matter what is happening, it would just be black all the time, which is probably not the best idea. And then also, you can change it from default to slider. And then if it's a slider, you get to set the min and max so that the user can't throw it into some sort of ludicrous, you know, state where it's like, oh, it's negative 100. What does it look like at negative 999? Oh, the same. What does it look like at negative98? Oh, the same. Right? And so you can save people some time here doing this kind of thing. Um, and then if we save it again, now if we look at this over here, you'll see it'll change. Now we get a slider and I can control the brightness of this. Like that. Okay, there we go. So, you can configure the inputs, which is great. Let's just do one other um, we'll come over here and make a color. And I'll call this surface uh, color. And drag this in. And uh now I'll go ahead and give it a like a gray or something. And I'll save. Now over here we should get yeah a color picker that we can use. And if we want to, you know, tint something, uh we can, you know, we could do it a bunch of different ways, but multiplying is usually uh how we would do it in this instance. And so if I were, you can just the node thing here. You can't tear them off in this direction. In Unity, you have to click on the node and delete it. And so here we are going to right this is kind of the brightness. And now we can take this and multiply it by this color and then send that to the color over here the input and save this. And so now I should be able to change the color of this like so from um from the interface, right? Without having to get in here and mess around with stuff. Uh great. And again, what options does it give us here? Okay, right here. Yeah, you can choose whether or not you want it to be an HDR color, which actually I'm not sure if that factors in on the color channel in the same way it does in the emission channel. Let's test it. If I come over here now, right, again, I get this slider in the color picker. If I didn't say HDR, that was not there. And so now if I crank this up color-wise. Okay. Yeah, perfect. And so that allows",
    "transcript_segment": "kind of want to set this up and then when you're just doing your momentto moment work, you really don't want to have a situation where you're dropping back into shader graph all the time to change it once you've set up the shader graph, right? Um just like we haven't been dropping back into C to make changes on like a regular basis based on how we're doing it because we're trying to work at the next level up. So, um it'd be great to be able to change these, you know, like in the editor over here. And you can do that over here. This is the uh inputs, right? And so you can make your own inputs, right? And so here you're putting on your tool designer hat like what controls uh would I need to use this thing on a regular basis? Right? And just like we've been learning all semester long, do you want to make a control for absolutely every parameter? No. How much complexity do you want? Just enough, right? To get the job done. enough so that you can explore what you want but not so much that it makes it um difficult to use. So for instance, if we want to control the number that this gets multiplied by here, I hit plus and we need to know what kind of number we want here or what kind of uh data type we want. And so remember our float here. So these words for us can be synonymous right scalar float essentially just one number. Um our vector three a lot of times our vector 3 this and this mathematically are very similar. But here, Unity treats it as a different data type so that it has an actual color inspector so that um you can pick the color like one would want to do often. Um and the other one we might use would be a texture 2D, which means you could, you know, swap out your, you know, the user could put in their own uh textures there. So, there's a lot of stuff here, but these would be our main ones I think we're going to use here. And so, not Jack or Alicia. What kind of data is this? Uh close getting closer. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So all all good guesses, right? Because it's a one. Booleans are either zero or ones. But when we were when I was scrubbing it here, you can see that it goes I should have done this and asked you what kind of data it was because then it's obvious that this has decimal points. And if it has decimal points, it is a float, right? Um, and so I want to be able to do this in just regular usage without having to be in shader graph. And so I hit plus, made a new float. I double click and I can label this. And I can call this like, you know, surface brightness. As per usual, when you're coming up with your own names for things, um, don't use spaces. And now how do I get this into here is that once you make you know a slot for a new input you can click drag it over and now this is you know essentially where you access that info. And so you can run that info into here. We can save this thing. And now if I were to just come over here and select this and then double click on water. Now our you know you'll notice that this material it looks way simpler than our other materials because it's like a total blank slate, right? All the other stuff had inputs that were already configured that we were using here. Um it just has this one input that we've configured, right? And so now I can grab this and um you know use it as an input here. Uh so we have that. Uh let's come back over here. Make sense so far? Questions? People on the left on my left. Good. Okay. Um great. So, we've got this set up. Let's take this a bit a bit further. I'm going to replace the simple noise. Um, again, you have to rightclick, create node. Um, and we'll go with uh yeah, gradient noise is more of a pear pear and noise kind of thing. And so if I were to route that in there like so, um, also in in the input, sorry, in the input, if you select the input up here, there's the default, uh, you can configure this input, right? And so what should the default value be? Right? You've heard me complain about this viciferously throughout the semester, mad at other people for putting the wrong defaults in there, which either show you nothing or don't show don't, you know, like you load it up and it doesn't do anything because all the defaults are not configured. So take some time to think about this kind of thing. In this case, having it be one rather than zero. If it's zero, no matter what is happening, it would just be black all the time, which is probably not the best idea. And then also, you can change it from default to slider. And then if it's a slider, you get to set the min and max so that the user can't throw it into some sort of ludicrous, you know, state where it's like, oh, it's negative 100. What does it look like at negative 999? Oh, the same. What does it look like at negative98? Oh, the same. Right? And so you can save people some time here doing this kind of thing. Um, and then if we save it again, now if we look at this over here, you'll see it'll change. Now we get a slider and I can control the brightness of this. Like that. Okay, there we go. So, you can configure the inputs, which is great. Let's just do one other um, we'll come over here and make a color. And I'll call this surface uh, color. And drag this in. And uh now I'll go ahead and give it a like a gray or something. And I'll save. Now over here we should get yeah a color picker that we can use. And if we want to, you know, tint something, uh we can, you know, we could do it a bunch of different ways, but multiplying is usually uh how we would do it in this instance.

Uh we don't want that to happen yet. Great. Now, uh let's take this a little bit further. uh down here our original noise that we have. So the gradient noise um this we have scale which gives us a smaller pattern or larger pattern. Um this might this is certainly anytime you have noise this is almost certainly something you want people to be able to control. So again plus float and I would say noise scale and drag this in probably say that it's between you know I don't know 30 here maybe the default is one or and yeah now I can route this into here and Save. And now I should have control on that. Perfect. The other input is a little bit more cryptic. And so this is where you access the UVs of the object. Okay. Now the object that we have here, the U the UVs are super simple, right? This is a plane which is I mean the default plane here I think is just literally one um face and in this instance the 3D space and the UV space are very similar. Remember UV space is always normalized meaning that we have the following coordinates. If you don't have this written down in your notes, I would have it written down. Understanding what normalized two-dimensional space looks like one one over here, right? The first number again is x. The second number is y. And so over here we have one zero and over here we have uh zero one. You have to know what the coordinate is at each of these corners. Um, great. And so here uh we have you know this UV space and it's this um by animating or processing the UV space is one of the primary ways to get um animated you know materials. In our case, this is what's going to help us do the waves of the water is that um we're going to be able to p perform some math on the UV space that'll make things look like they're moving, but they're not actually going to move, right? This is all in material land. And so none of this, this is not going to be water that other things could float on top of. It's not going to collide with stuff, you know, like it just looks like water, right? So with that in mind, let's look at that. Uh if I were to again rightclick and come over here and say create node. Um and so this is the tiling and offset node. Um, again, this is super at first this looks like just, oh, that's a fun, you know, gradient. Um, but this gradient is really, if you understand this gradient, you you're opening the door to doing work in this space, right? Um, because like I've talked about before, when we take three numbers and we put them together, what's something we could store with three numbers? like a thing that we care about that we use often. >> Color. >> Color. RGB. Right. What's something else we could store with three numbers? >> Yeah. Position of some kind, right? Um, and a lot of times there's like this again to the computer at some base level, it don't care. It's three numbers, right? Like you ch here's three numbers. I'm going to perform some math on them, do some things, and then you do whatever you want with them, right? Uh, and so this is one of those things where, uh, we're, you know, doing something that's going to be essentially UV position, but here it's taking that and showing it to us in terms of color, right? Uh because right over here um right this was um one zero in our coordinate area. Right? And so, uh, max one aligns with R here, which is why this corner is 100% red, right? This one is yellow because we get um 100% red and 100% green. Over here, we get just green because it's uh 100% it's 01. And down here, we get black because it's 0 0. Right? And so that's what this is telling us here. And this will change as we manipulate this stuff. If we were to offset the x value here, you know, you're like, \"Oh, cool. The gradient's changing.\" But like if you understand what is happening here, right? I'm I'm moving the zero x over and changing what I'm seeing here, right? And so this is all um super useful, right? Um and here remember UV space for as much as we care about it here is always 2D, right? There is a such thing as 3D UV space, but really it's more like slice, multiple slices of 2D space where you have distinct uh quantized slices, right? you're not usually scanning through it in the way that we conceive of a 3D space. Um, so but we're not going to touch that at all. We're just in 2D two dimensional UV space. So here, uh, yeah. All right. So let's look here. One of the if I hook this up. So this allows me to manipulate UV space. And I can, as you may have guessed, this has two numbers, two dimensional UV space, and it can be routed into here, our other uh UV space. And so here to here. And so now uh let's go ahead and be able to manipulate this live. So I'll hit plus and say vector 2. And I'll call this offset or UV offset. And I'll just route this down here and run it into here. And just save for now. And I should get a vector two over here. Right? So vector 2 is going to give me two slots. a vector three if you don't say it's a color gives you just three slots here, right? And so again, like having the color picker makes more sense when you're going to use it in that way. Uh, and so now I can do this essentially scroll the texture. And for a texture like this, which is designed to seamlessly wrap around, it looks like I'm just endlessly scrolling, right? And I can do it in both directions by simply offsetting the UV space. And so this concept is, you know, the key for animating textures, right? We're gonna somehow usually offset the UV space. This is what's happening with um our sprite sheet stuff from the particles is that all of those were laid out in UV space like this. And essentially that sprite sheet module in the particle system is a a much more complicated UV offset thing where it's saying it's, you know, scale, you know, it's just jumping to different UV locations at a specific rate in order to play that back as if it's, you know, a flip book animation. So yeah, there we",

    "search_text": "AVC200 December 01, 2025 Advanced Water Effects with Dual Noise Patterns go. Um, that's great, but I want to animate it by not having to do this. And so, we get one more super important node here, uh, that allows us to change to animate stuff. In order to animate stuff, we need to be able to talk about time, right? And so the time node here is almost always on the far left of these animated shader graphs because you need to be able to access, you know, the changing clock number and then do something with that, right? And so um now the one way to do this is just to multiply it. And so I could shift A or not shift A. I could uh look for malt to apply here. If we don't if it's not going to be a texture, sometimes visualizing it like this is counterproductive. And so you can sort of fold it up and just use it as like a you know, this is still doing the same thing. It's just a simpler way to look at it. And so here Unity will be um graceful here in that it'll let you multiply this vector 2 by time. Time is a just just one number, right? It's just like clock clock time go up. That's it. Um and so the result here is like we multiply this by the number, we multiply that by the number, we get a result. And so here, uh I'm going to run this in like so. and go ahead and save. And now it's automatically scrolling the if you don't see it automatically moving, it's up here in the scene view where it says always refresh, right? And so if that's unchecked, it won't be playing the shader animation in the scene view, which if you have a giant scene and there's a ton of this stuff happening it and you're working at the peak of what the computer is capable of, then it makes some sense to uncheck that so that you're just just looking at the thing you need as opposed to having everything going all the time. But we'll we'll have it on for now. And so now it's happening all the time, right? to just now this this shader is an animated shader graph, right? It's u moving like this over time. And so we're doing it with noise. But this formula is one of the primary ones. The idea we take time, we use it to change the offset and then you know this could be anything, right? It doesn't have to be noise. If I were to bring in anything else here, I could route this into the UVs again and just route this into here and save. And there we go. Right now it's just manipulating the UVs on this, you know, random particle image there. Let's put it back to the way it was. Okay, great. Um, now is the question. Yeah, I made something animate. Great. uh how do I uh change this at all? How do I do the the most fundamental thing here is change the speed of this? And you can do this when you just have time you multiply time. And so um less than one is going to slow down and greater than one uh is going to speed up. And so you need to do some more multiplication here. Right? This is the downside of nodal programming is like some sort of what could be just one line of math in regular code ends up being sort of blown out into other things. There's ways to condense it. uh here uh most of the time when you grab time here control c control or uh let's just make another multiply here cr control + v bring this in delete this delete this almost always you take the time run it into something like this and run it into there and so you have this here which allows you to control the speed at which it's animating now I just hit something that closed that window. Let's save this. Let me close this tab and open it again. Dang it. I have no idea why I did turn that off. Okay, that's called the blackboard maybe inputs. Anyway, uh there we go. So, uh yeah, and so this is something we definitely want to be able to manipulate. Float and we'll call this speed. And then we can drag this down here and do this. And this is, you know, almost always how you set this kind of thing up. Again, you probably want the default value to be one so that it is animating when you make a new one. Um, not have zero because then unless you change the speed, it wouldn't do anything. And so now if we come back here and select this uh and select our material here we get a speed parameter where we can speed this up or slow it way down. If you do go negative it goes the other way. Right? So in this case that may be useful. So that um usually just like everything else like the defaults are so end up being like an artistically too fast result almost all the time. And so having it be less than one. Slowing it down is going to be the other way. Uh yeah. So this is just regular time. Essentially this is a number that's just continually going up over the time that Unity has been running. Um and then sign time. uh gives us a sine wave if you wanted something to oscillate. Um and yeah, delt I mean that's fine. Let's leave it at that. Great. Okay. So, there we go. We've got something animating and we can sort of see uh the future a little bit here, right? we've got this noisy pattern and this does if it wasn't you know black and white noise if it was rather sort of like perhaps the normal map right this could start to look like waves on an ocean right so um now knowing what we know we're okay we have brightness and darkness right and this is something when we talk about the up and downness of the shader like this and it's in black and white that's usually a bump map right and if this was this essentially is a bump map we run this into the normal channel here we should be able to get something along the lines of what we're talking about right so let's do it uh over here uh okay so the what are we not going to need here we're going to be using this as normal information not the surface color. We're going to come back to some things here and just table a couple of those inputs and come back to them. And for right now, we've got this. And uh how do we turn this into a normal map? Here it is the um yeah, normal from height, right? And so in my notes, bump map and height map and displacement map. Although displacement not 100% of the time. All of these are going to be black and white. You can do displacement that you reads a normal map, but that's not that's usually not the default. Um whereas a normal map it's going to be RGB right B where it's one of those situations where we're doing that thing again. We're going to take essentially instead of like a position in this case it's an angle right of um X Y and Z angle and storing it in RGB uh values. So uh normal from height here create node normal from height. And now we can take this information run it into here. Now we have something that when you see this now all of you should be thinking yeah it's a some kind of normal map that needs to go into the normal channel right because they always end up looking um kind of blue when you visualize them with color. And so this needs to go into our normal map here. And let's go ahead and save. There we go. And so now if I were to look at this and grab our directional light and maybe play with the angle of this and make it brighter. There we go. We can see how this is now again the brightness and the darkness is a result of the normal map not a result of the surface color. Right? We can go in and change the surface color to whatever we would want. And then this gets its own uh setting. And so here our normal map uh strength, this is something we probably want to be able to control. And so again, this is a scalar here. And so I'll say normal strength. And this should come in here. our result here. You know, 0.1 is probably a good starting point or actually and it's a good idea to limit this because you you have a normal map that's too strong. It just looks really cruddy. And so let's run that into there. And now uh save select. And now you I can dial this up. zero to one is actually way too big here. And so let's say the max is like 0 two or something like that. So that you know when you have a slider you pretty much want the you know the sl the left to right range of the slider to be you know artistically useful. Not you know not have you know the only parts that look good are like you know this part down here. you know, like then you're just sending the wrong message, especially if someone doesn't know what they're doing looking at the they're just coming in green. Okay, so you can see where we're going here with this. This is the underlying concept, right? We use time. We're able to control the speed of it to offset some kind of noise. the noise. We're able to can change the scale of this, right? So, the uh noise scale here if I want bigger",
    "transcript_segment": "go. Um, that's great, but I want to animate it by not having to do this. And so, we get one more super important node here, uh, that allows us to change to animate stuff.

And so here Unity will be um graceful here in that it'll let you multiply this vector 2 by time. Time is a just just one number, right? It's just like clock clock time go up. That's it. Um and so the result here is like we multiply this by the number, we multiply that by the number, we get a result. And so here, uh I'm going to run this in like so. and go ahead and save. And now it's automatically scrolling the if you don't see it automatically moving, it's up here in the scene view where it says always refresh, right? And so if that's unchecked, it won't be playing the shader animation in the scene view, which if you have a giant scene and there's a ton of this stuff happening it and you're working at the peak of what the computer is capable of, then it makes some sense to uncheck that so that you're just just looking at the thing you need as opposed to having everything going all the time. But we'll we'll have it on for now. And so now it's happening all the time, right? to just now this this shader is an animated shader graph, right? It's u moving like this over time. And so we're doing it with noise. But this formula is one of the primary ones. The idea we take time, we use it to change the offset and then you know this could be anything, right? It doesn't have to be noise. If I were to bring in anything else here, I could route this into the UVs again and just route this into here and save. And there we go. Right now it's just manipulating the UVs on this, you know, random particle image there. Let's put it back to the way it was. Okay, great. Um, now is the question. Yeah, I made something animate. Great. uh how do I uh change this at all? How do I do the the most fundamental thing here is change the speed of this? And you can do this when you just have time you multiply time. And so um less than one is going to slow down and greater than one uh is going to speed up. And so you need to do some more multiplication here. Right? This is the downside of nodal programming is like some sort of what could be just one line of math in regular code ends up being sort of blown out into other things. There's ways to condense it. uh here uh most of the time when you grab time here control c control or uh let's just make another multiply here cr control + v bring this in delete this delete this almost always you take the time run it into something like this and run it into there and so you have this here which allows you to control the speed at which it's animating now I just hit something that closed that window. Let's save this. Let me close this tab and open it again. Dang it. I have no idea why I did turn that off. Okay, that's called the blackboard maybe inputs. Anyway, uh there we go. So, uh yeah, and so this is something we definitely want to be able to manipulate. Float and we'll call this speed. And then we can drag this down here and do this. And this is, you know, almost always how you set this kind of thing up. Again, you probably want the default value to be one so that it is animating when you make a new one. Um, not have zero because then unless you change the speed, it wouldn't do anything. And so now if we come back here and select this uh and select our material here we get a speed parameter where we can speed this up or slow it way down. If you do go negative it goes the other way. Right? So in this case that may be useful. So that um usually just like everything else like the defaults are so end up being like an artistically too fast result almost all the time. And so having it be less than one. Slowing it down is going to be the other way. Uh yeah. So this is just regular time. Essentially this is a number that's just continually going up over the time that Unity has been running. Um and then sign time. uh gives us a sine wave if you wanted something to oscillate. Um and yeah, delt I mean that's fine. Let's leave it at that. Great. Okay. So, there we go. We've got something animating and we can sort of see uh the future a little bit here, right? we've got this noisy pattern and this does if it wasn't you know black and white noise if it was rather sort of like perhaps the normal map right this could start to look like waves on an ocean right so um now knowing what we know we're okay we have brightness and darkness right and this is something when we talk about the up and downness of the shader like this and it's in black and white that's usually a bump map right and if this was this essentially is a bump map we run this into the normal channel here we should be able to get something along the lines of what we're talking about right so let's do it uh over here uh okay so the what are we not going to need here we're going to be using this as normal information not the surface color. We're going to come back to some things here and just table a couple of those inputs and come back to them. And for right now, we've got this. And uh how do we turn this into a normal map? Here it is the um yeah, normal from height, right? And so in my notes, bump map and height map and displacement map. Although displacement not 100% of the time. All of these are going to be black and white. You can do displacement that you reads a normal map, but that's not that's usually not the default. Um whereas a normal map it's going to be RGB right B where it's one of those situations where we're doing that thing again. We're going to take essentially instead of like a position in this case it's an angle right of um X Y and Z angle and storing it in RGB uh values. So uh normal from height here create node normal from height. And now we can take this information run it into here. Now we have something that when you see this now all of you should be thinking yeah it's a some kind of normal map that needs to go into the normal channel right because they always end up looking um kind of blue when you visualize them with color. And so this needs to go into our normal map here. And let's go ahead and save. There we go. And so now if I were to look at this and grab our directional light and maybe play with the angle of this and make it brighter. There we go. We can see how this is now again the brightness and the darkness is a result of the normal map not a result of the surface color. Right? We can go in and change the surface color to whatever we would want. And then this gets its own uh setting. And so here our normal map uh strength, this is something we probably want to be able to control. And so again, this is a scalar here. And so I'll say normal strength. And this should come in here. our result here. You know, 0.1 is probably a good starting point or actually and it's a good idea to limit this because you you have a normal map that's too strong. It just looks really cruddy. And so let's run that into there. And now uh save select. And now you I can dial this up. zero to one is actually way too big here. And so let's say the max is like 0 two or something like that. So that you know when you have a slider you pretty much want the you know the sl the left to right range of the slider to be you know artistically useful. Not you know not have you know the only parts that look good are like you know this part down here. you know, like then you're just sending the wrong message, especially if someone doesn't know what they're doing looking at the they're just coming in green. Okay, so you can see where we're going here with this. This is the underlying concept, right? We use time. We're able to control the speed of it to offset some kind of noise. the noise. We're able to can change the scale of this, right? So, the uh noise scale here if I want bigger"

    "search_text": "AVC200 December 01, 2025 Normal Maps and Wave Height Control waves or smaller waves here. Um, and so if I make it larger, we can see that that's animating there. Um, so now this is the the the underlying concept. All right. And now in order to build higher and higher fidelity water surfaces, it's kind of just layering more things on top of this base, right? First of all, all the waves are going in the exact same direction here. And so, uh, that's usually not how it looks, right? You kind of shouldn't, unless you have like this very strong wind or something, they're just kind of going over top of each other. And so one way to uh approach that is instead of just having one noise animated noise pattern is to make you know two and have them go in opposite directions. And so then you get this kind of emergent um pattern of where they're being added and subtracted from each other in order to create this much more uh you know not 100% natural but much more natural looking wave pattern. Right? And once you start to figure out what you know the blocks are of stuff are that work then taking these next kind of steps um isn't too bad where you can just sort of duplicate things and then uh figure it out from there. So for instance let's have one going one noise pattern going this way and the other noise pattern going that way and then we'll get uh a slightly more complex uh system of of water here. Actually, first let's change out the noise. This is the super simple noise. The other one, keep hitting shift A. Here we go. Um, what is the other one? Gradient noise. Yeah, here we go. Simple noise. If we turn the scale down, gives us, you know, a lot more interesting surface. And so here, if we just uh sub this out, got rid of that one, reconnected the stuff. So, let's scroll this one. Be able to change the scale and route this into here. And save. And this is less contrasty. And so now probably have to turn this up to get more going there. And then our noise scale, right? So there we go. We get definitely incrementally more convincing sort of wave pattern there. Uh let's go ahead and make some changes here to what's going on. So for instance, the smoothness I'm going to put up at like 0.99 so that it's uh very uh reflective. Usually, if we put in like a Let's put in a light here so we can see a little bit more what's going on. you have to click into the shader graph window in order to um save the shader graph. Okay, so just giving us some base, you know, values there starts to get us way more into the zone. having a specular highlight there starts to look like the surface of the water. Um, just moving it around now, we get much better surface there. The other thing is that uh remember by default the shaders are not transparent, right? Because transparency is expensive and they want you to opt in to transparency. And in this case, it depends what you want, right? So, if it's a big if you make the surface of the water transparent, you need to put something underneath it or else it's just going to look like garbage, right? Like it just it's just going to be gray void underneath it. Just like we've discussed times in other scenarios where this happens with reflections, right? There's nothing around to reflect and it looks weird because there's nothing around to reflect. Uh so here if we want this shader graph to be transparent we need to say surface type uh transparent and then uh save and then it should give us the alpha down here which then you can dial down and we'll start to get a transparent uh surface of the water. And so now, you know, this is a water surface that you could put in different areas. Um you probably don't want it casting shadows, right, like it is here on the floor. And so turning that off. And so in here the graph inspector in terms of configuring this stuff is not you know animatable. You can't access it via the because it's usually just like base settings, right? You you don't want to have a shader animating from transparent to not transparent, right? Even if you're doing something like that, you would just be scrubbing the alpha value. You wouldn't be like turning the feature on and off. Um, and so now if I save that, that should get rid of that thing. If I bring it a little bit, you know, more solid here. There we go. Just so we can see it a little bit better. There we go. And again, having a light there so we can more clearly look at the surface of the water, right? And so now this uh you know once you would change you know being able to dial in the speed and everything else like this you know if you wanted to put water in a pool, water in a you know small fountain kind of thing. This would be like not the water that's spraying out of the fountain, the water that's like collecting in the fountain. All these kind of things would be uh the way we'd want to do that. Let's get the double wave thing happening because that's not too much. Um, in order to do that, we want to discreetly control the directions of these waves. And right now, I'm multiplying the UV space, both numbers of the UV space, right? And so, it's going in a diagonal because I'm multiplying the X and the Y, right? If you have x and y go up on your cartisian plane, that's this graph, right? It goes x is going up and y is going up. And so you get this diagonal line. Um the over here, um yeah, that's what I'm doing in this step here. UV offset is two numbers and I'm multiplying them both by what's going on here. And so um One of the ways to do this is like we want to multiply one chain on the X and we want to multiply the other chain on the Y. And so here this is just the output of the speed. And I'm going to make a new uh vector 2, right? And so this allows me to route this speed number discreetly to either this one or this one now. And so I'll route this to here. And then uh multiply this. Now we're going to multiply vector 2 by a vector 2. And so now if I save and look at this, we should see the wave. There we go. It's going uh straight across in this direction. And let's crank up the normal strength so that it's a little more visually obvious what's happening. So maybe that normal strength range needs to be a little bit bigger. There we go. So now we can see it's moving directly across like that. Uh now we want the other one going this way and then add them together. So over here uh this is all the whole thing right so we need separate you have to in terms of duplicating do I want to just duplicate the whole thing no right this is the actual inputs I don't think it lets you duplicate that um then this is the thing that's actually combining you're turning it into a normal map um I don't want to duplicate that I need another noise I do want to duplicate that and separate tiling. So I'm going to grab these three things and controll Ctrl +V and then down here. Um when you have this like double chain like this, you have to think about which of them need discrete numbers and which of them do you want to get the same number. And so the uh offset here, we're not directly manipulating that anymore. We're using the time for that. So in this case, I'm going to duplicate the vector 2 like so. And it'll route to the bottom number. Right? So here we're going to multiply the X. Here we're going to multiply the Y. And this one will go to this UV. This one will go to this UV. It goes into the offset, not the UV input, which is why that turned red and got all messed up. There we go. Um, yeah. And so here, this is where this really, you know, hopefully this is coming to Blender soon. Like being able to see the math at each show your work, right? like you can see it you can it makes understanding this stuff I think much easier uh when you don't have to like you know manifest this in your mind from nothingness it's hard you know much more difficult um great so here in a case where we duplicate an input like this noise scale it's essentially you know that number is routed to both of these and so this is functionally the this is functionally the same as this, right? So, it just depends how close they are on the graph, right? Um, in terms of not having these lines that go, you know, way off screen just makes it easier to understand. In this case, it's kind of who cares. Uh, great. And so, now we just need to comp these two things together and then send them over here. So what kind of math do we want to do? Do we want to have there? There's some options here. And so we could look at them here. The comp node is no. Everyone has a different name for their Okay. Yeah. Here it's blend for blend mode, right? In in Blender it, ironically, it's not called blend. It's called uh uh color mix, right? Yeah, I wish we could get some consensus on what to call this node because you need it. You always need this node, right? You got two images, you want to combine them, you know, uh but in every program, it's got a different name. Um, you know, we could just grab the specific mathematical operation we want to do, like we could use an add node or a multiply node, but this one allows us to easily access all the uh obvious uh Photoshop blend modes here, right? So we could uh make some adjustments to this. And so here we just want this one and this one. And now you can sort of see what's happening there, right? Um we could go let's go overlay like here. There we go. And then route this combined version into here. And save. And now we should get something. There we go. Right. This looks way less directional, right? Because we have these two um patterns working, you know, going in opposite directions. And yeah, I mean, now that you know how the sausage is made, when you're looking at it, you can, you know, visually parse it. If you slow it down a bunch, um, you can under speed. There we go. Now I think we get when slowed down to some sort of usable speed I think it becomes much more um usable in that in that way right and so yeah we have something where we can change the amount of what's going on yeah like the size of the waves the height of the waves here right and so this is another decision you need to make when you're designing these kind of tools, right? The technical name here is normal strength, right? But you're making this thing that's for making waves. And so this is technically like or not technically this is in practice the wave height and this is the wave scale. And so what do you name these? Do you call it wave height and wave scale? because that would probably be more obvious without having someone know how the shader graph is constructed, right? And so yeah, right. Everyone has has experience with this now, right? Where you open up the thing and all you know there's like a lot of parameters and you're like great and of course you know the good news is there's a lot of parameters. The bad news is >> there's a lot of parameters, right? And then also the name of the parameters, right? If there if you if there's like 15 things that you don't know what any of them mean, like that's probably worse in practice than having like three that have some sort of meaningful label on them, right? So, we got that. Um, cool. If we want to bring that surface color back into the so the um metallic and smoothness and um alpha of the whole thing, those would probably be things we want to have here. And let's let's make the change that we've just talked about. And so noise scale ends up being wave",

No, it doesn't let you forward this drop down to there um for whatever reason. And so if we put this into here, there we go. Now we can change the color of it going to here and save. And so now the surface of the water can be changed. It's not super effective because you know the C3iness here, right? And so again, these are things we'd want to probably adjust. So, uh, I'd make a float here for surface transparency and drag that up here and route that into the alpha. Probably put it at something like 0.5 by default. This probably needs to be a zero to one slider. There we go. And there we go for that. And then probably something like uh surface smoothness, right? So this is just some sort of house housekeeping stuff here so that you know it's usable. Um no nothing weird happening. We just need to be able to control these numbers without having to jump into the shader graph to do junk. And so because we don't want to do that and so we bring this in here and just route the smoothness to the smoothness. This is very much like, you know, hooking up textures in Blender where we're just sort of forwarding the numbers from one point to the next. What's the default value? Probably 0.5. We probably want to again limit it to 0ero to one. That's good. Let's organize those up here. And yeah, I don't know. Let's go with that for now. And so now I have something where if I'm looking at the game itself, it'll look the playback, especially when you're in editor mode, you may be kind of chunky or choppy, but when it goes into play mode, it's usually pretty good here. And so now I have something where I can, you know, dial in the amount of this. How much of the wave height are we going to see? So, especially here when we're creating a bump, you're creating the normal information from a bump map, it's going to um, you know, you can definitely dial it too far there. And so this at zero. There we go. And so now we can sort of tint it, right? So let's say at some point uh Mr. peppermint falls into a vat of toxic goo um and um in a factory and his skin gets uh bleached and he starts developing a we'll call it an affinity for clown makeup and um who knows what happens next. and he turns into >> God. We're I'm I'm probably gonna live to see that movie. All right. Where Mark Mark Wahberg gets cast as the Joker in the ninth uh cinematic version of the Batman universe. Yeah, because who was the tattooed dude for the very shortlived previous one? >> Jared Leto. >> Jared Leto. Right. Right. Right. Where he looked like a jugalo. Now, the other room for experimentation here is um if you had other noises that you could bring in or noise texture here. Uh, one, you know, you don't have to use the procedural noise as long as it's something that would be tileable, then it' be something that you could use in this fashion, right? Um, yeah. So, let's save that. Uh, and let let's do one other quick application of this concept. So, that gives us, you know, an interesting water shader. Um, and again, you you'll if you start looking around online, there's, you know, far more complex water add-ons in Unity and everything, but you know, at the core, it's pretty much this. Maybe there's some uh this noise is also routed to the displacement. So, there's a little bit more up and down, but again, that's going to be more expensive. Um, and a lot of times students have big sections of water. So you usually discourage that and keep it from being also if you actually wanted to displace then you need to manage the mesh in that this is just one face. And so if we were to displace here it's not going to look like anything. It's just going to be the whole thing going up and down. Uh because it's just one it's only four vertices. uh the other um yeah and then there's all sorts of things you know going on like where they combine what if that got a little bit more solid and a little bit more white that can give you some sort of the wave cresting sort of stuff. Um, and then you know what if you had um in terms of like walking through and getting like live ripples, a lot of that system is a separate camera that's sort of like pointed directly down at the thing. And that is looking at the black and white values of something that's moving around and then creating syosoidal patterns that come out from that in an animated texture that you route back into the height map in order to make ripples that would actually interact in real time with everything there. Right? So we dealt with this this this is like another fundamental concept in real-time visual effects or visual effects of any kind is that you know we have the camera through which we're seeing the game but then in a lot of other instances it makes sense to have these other cameras, right? Those real-time reflections. We talked about that, right? That's like as if you mounted cameras on the thing that were pointed out and then it takes the image that the camera sees and wraps it around like a reflection, right? that's the cheap way to do reflections as opposed to like actually simulating the bouncing of all the photons which is almost always more expensive. Um and this would be another instance if you wanted that live input but you know the complexity of the node graph then is going to you know explode into stuff that's probably not great for the first day you're learning about this. So, uh, good. Let's just do one other thing",
    "transcript_segment": "um we'll call it wave scale. And then normal strength ends up being wave height. And then um speed ends up being wave speed, right? And so then it makes sense to start to group these things together. We're not using UV offset anymore. That was just for the demonstration. And so let's delete that. And so now we have surface color. But if we look, uh surface color is no longer hooked up to anything, right? So that's not great. We either need to get rid of it or use it. And so here we can um if we route this into here and save we'll get something where the color you know is now part of this. And so probably just being able to multiply this by a color here. And so let's bring this out and look for the multiply or I mean yeah because there's no do we have an input for this here. No, it doesn't let you forward this drop down to there um for whatever reason. And so if we put this into here, there we go. Now we can change the color of it going to here and save.

So, uh, good. Let's just do one other thing"

    "search_text": "AVC200 December 01, 2025 Lighting Systems for Indoor vs Outdoor Scenes here with this kind of like noise pattern. You can also do like energy goo, which is, uh, usually something that's useful for a lot of the other, uh, games. And so, I probably want to use this as a starting point. And so, I need to duplicate the whole system. Okay, so the shader graph and the material so that we have separate things. And so, here I'll duplicate this. Just control drag it. And I'll call this one um energy. And then I'll make a I don't know. Let's do something different. Let's make a cylinder or something. Yeah, there we go. And uh this over here up and then I'll make a new material called um energy and put this on that and on the energy material. Grab the shader graph and load that up. and it'll look like the water here to start, right? And so something else you can do occasionally if you had um maybe you didn't have the water running in both directions or maybe you did and then if you were to um tilt this and you wanted water flowing down like a waterfall or something like that and sped it up, you could get to something closeish there. Right? So that's one of the uh techniques. And if you look at the particle pack, they're doing their waterfalls in that way and that there's like a plane with the shader on it going down here. And then there's like a particle system down here that's doing like the spraying uh for when it hits, you know, whatever the surface is, right? So a lot of like the more complex visual effects, it's not just one thing. It's like a bunch of things together. Um okay, back to here. Let's start editing this one. And so I'm going to double click on energy. And what we want is just sort of like a like gooey bright energy field kind of thing. And so we have motion we could do, but instead of routing this into the normal map, let's route it into the emission so we can do something more interesting there. And so I'm going to put this in multiply so that we get mostly dark stuff. And also slow this down. Uh delete this. Delete this input for now. And let's take this and instead of running it to the color um we're going to run it to the um emission over here. And let's save this. And now over here, if I come in and look at the energy shader, let's turn down the speed to maybe 0.1. Let's um look at the scale and then the surface color. Let's try to get bigger gaps in here with this. So, uh, I'm going to route this to the emission and the alpha, so parts of it are more seeth through or should be totally see-through. Uh, I'm also want to be able to control the contrast here. Uh, is there a contrast? Yeah, just a contrast node. And so here, if I bring this down, uh, it doesn't do the automatic connection thing like it does in Blender. But now, if I were to do this, there we go. I just want mostly black, but these areas of noise, you like uh noise like that. And so if we look at that and uh in this case I don't want it to be reflective. Let's say zero metallic. And then also in the shader itself. We probably don't even want to deal with the smoothness here. So I might delete that one. Zero. Try to make it a little bit more flat. There we go. Now let's also route this over here. There we go. And so now if I were to crank up some of the HDR on this. Let's see. We're multiplying there. I think we want to multiply after this. So I'm going to route this into here. Put the multiply after. There we go. So now I can start to control. Let's see here. Let's make this surface color just white. So we get the color of the emission. And why is that not see-through? We have alpha. Did I change the settings on this? No. Still transparent. So here we want to be able to control exactly like how much energy there is. So this contrast value is super useful. Let's go ahead and put some of these things in. So the surface color we're going to keep. The surface brightness we don't have anymore. The surface smoothness we don't have anymore. Um, we don't need this one either. And so, wave scale, wave speed, weight, height, we're keeping, but we need a new one for contrast. And so, here we go. What do we label this? Maybe like energy contrast. And as a float, this can come in here to this. Let's put it at maybe like five by default. And if there is stuff behind this, what does it actually look like? I think we're just not It's black here because we're not seeing a lot of stuff behind it. Yeah, something the way the alpha is being blended here. It's giving us black rather than see through. Let's just make sure that this is not part of the issue. Zero metallic, zero smoothness. There we go. We're seeing through it now. There we go. That's much more of what we would want. Let's see. Now we just got goo with see through. And then the goo color we can route into our emission here. I think we're getting super negative values coming out of our multiply. Let's see what's going on there. Because when this is not attached, when we disconnect this one and we save, we get our nice see-throughness. So I think our brightness thing here, this is sort of a strange issue where we are getting negative HDR values, right? Because it does allow you to go which is physically confusing, right? Like it's eating light, you know, like it's a little confusing, but if we clamp this, let's try that. So control A or right click. I think we have a clamp node. And so our min we want to keep it zero and say our max. There we go. And so if we clamped our color output into our emission and then saved. There we go. And so now if we crank this way, it gets brighter. But when we go this way, it doesn't. And we're still getting nice see-throughness there. And so, especially with our directional light off, now we just have this. And now we've got something where, you know, if we want a green energy ooze in like some sort of like power up container or something like that. Um, again, I think the wave stuff probably works here, right? If you want it to be like this or you have like a containment cell uh that needs to be opened at some point later or if you got a nuclear reactor that needs to be uh doing nuclear reaction stuff, right? Um things like this. The height here is actually not a thing because we're not using the normal channel anymore. But the there's or you made a lava lamp for a gangster lounge, right? Um all of those kind of things you could sort of dial in using this. Um yeah, or any kind of like force field kind of thing would work in this instance. And you can control the amount of brightness and saturation for whatever it is that you're looking at. Let's turn it up more. So, same sort of core of what's going on, but you know, you could get some different different effects there. So, uh I'll make both of these available. Our sort of water surface and water energy or an energy thing here so that you could hook them up and use them as you see fit there. But again, another example of something that could be used if you have something that's sort of beyond, you know, where you're not trying to make threedimensional fog that you move through, but sort of fog that's there in the distance. This could certainly be part of it there. Um, you know, or the water surface. So, some of the basic stuff's on shader graph there to get you started. You know, the the issue with the HDR is that, you know, HDR gives us this brightness, but then here the issue we're running into is it was also making it uh super dark, you know, darker than zero. Just like the HDR can be brighter than one. Here we have it darker than zero, which was kind of um making it so dark that the transparency didn't look really correct. But now, if we just sort of limit that so it doesn't go below zero, then we're fine. Makes sense, right? So, um, yeah, I mean, the idea that you just animate a texture with time sort of our main thing over here. Let's look at this real quick. So, in this setup now, um, a couple things about lighting.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 December 01, 2025 Procedural Skybox and Environment Setup So we've you know used the the light system but in Unity the other issue here if we make some sort of large reflective thing is is I'm going to create a material here and throw this on here And yeah, smoothness is up, metallic is up. Um, let's turn on the turn the directional light back on and down. Okay. Is what are we actually reflecting here uh when we don't use a reflection probe? And all a lot of this stuff is all going to be in one. Uh it's going to be window and then environment. Um and then lighting. And here we can control what the HDR is. We did this in the ball game, right? Didn't we make a procedural sky shader? No. Okay. So we we can the wraparound environment which is contributing to both the reflections and the lighting um we can control there in addition to the mist right very similar to the mist pass in Blender which is going to be labeled as fog here in Unity um for things having some sort of limit natural limit that you can the um things just sort of wash out into the background. Um yeah, let's look at that. So in here under window rendering lighting. There we go. Render rendering lighting. It pulls up this window. So there's a lot here. And it's the environment tab. and the environment tab. Um, this is where a lot of the important things are. So, we have uh the skybox, our HDR, it has its own material. This is very analogous to Blender, right? Where there's the you switch the shader to world mode, and now you're talking about what's the thing that wraps around. Same idea. This is the material that wraps around the scene. And by default, it's that super lame just blue with like slightly bright towards the horizon shader. That's the skybox. And then also, we have this fog setting here. Um, we'll get to that in a second. Let's make our own skybox first, right? So, if I were to I think this is live, right? Can I control this character? I think all that's set up in this scene. Yeah, let's just move the camera out. There we go. Um, good. Now back here. Let's make a new sky. So this could be there's a couple there's some options here, right? So you can I think for most of your games the solution here is to use a procedural sky which allows you to control the color and uh intensity. The other option here is that you also can load HDR images like in Blender. But the problem exists where if the HDR image is anything other than just clouds, it looks terrible, right? Because you just have these like flat images of buildings or trees on the horizon that don't parallax and it looks really crappy. So uh in most of these instance HDR images just clouds um so let's look at those two options. one. Um, make your own create uh material and here this is going to be my skybox. And then here under this universal render pipeline actually I think this is yeah skybox procedural. There we go. Now, um, this is the default Unity one we're all familiar with. Um, how do I actually use this? You got to plug it into that window. And so, rendering lighting environment here. And so, if I bring this into here, you can replace the default with this one. And now this is live. And so the uh sky tint here for instance we can change and We are changing it. Why is it not showing up there? We've replaced it. This is my skybox. It is skybox procedural. It is in here. This is using it. I'm going to just reload the scene. Once you update there, we should be seeing it in the scene. Let's just open it again. Oh, main camera. I think I changed this in the default environment skybox. Now, if I come back here, so if you made a default scene, you probably didn't need to change that. But if you duplicated one of the existing scenes as a start. Um, but actually, no, that's per camera. So, if you made a new camera, then that would be different there. And you would have that already set to skybox. And so now Now we can see it changing in the background here. And if we hit generate lighting, we re-ake what's being used. This is probably why we didn't see the environment thing before. And so here regenerates the whole thing. So now we're using whatever our skybox is, right? And so we see these default shadows and default lighting change. Right? So this is really separate from Blender in that these the HDR and Blender we're using mostly for reflection because it doesn't uh you know contribute to lighting quite as much here whereas here it's definitely the default is that contributes much more right uh to the default look and feel of the thing. And so uh the skybox the procedural skybox thing has some settings. So we have this thickness which kind of like does a hue shift and whatever you put in there for your sky tint and everything else. And so here trying to I think the default atmosphere is like you know earthlike. And so you're kind of tinting it uh from that. Say we want to do more of like a Mars thing. And then the sun size here like this is the so as your sun the position of the sun is linked to a directional light. Okay. So, for outside scenes, putting the main directional light, of which you should have only one if you're an outside scene, uh, in here allows this reflection to be fed by this. And so, if the actual angle of the light changes, you see the hot spot in the reflection actually change there. And so that allows for that linkage to to happen there. Um the intensity multiplier here if we don't want uh as much of this filling in and if you're inside um either blacking this out totally um may be the way to go. So that way you get more of the light coming from what you're actually doing with the lights there. So, okay, this is outside. Let's go ahead and save this for a second. Let me do a different one as inside. And so, which one is this? This is the particle example scene. We'll come back to here here. So in our window here, we want it to look like we're inside and so we're getting most of the light from just the other um light objects. So I'm going to get rid of this. Just say none. I'm going to make the shadow color not tinted so that it doesn't have that outside look. I can turn this down. Um, and then tell it to generate again. And then we're inside, so I'm not going to have a directional light. Now things actually get totally dark, which even when you turned it down before was not the situation, right? Because this we're getting nothing from there. And so now the only light we're getting is from our point light. And so now if I move this around and it has real time shadows. There we go. Now we can control the lighting as if we're inside an actual space.",
    "transcript_segment": "So we've you know used the the light system but in Unity the other issue here if we make some sort of large reflective thing is is I'm going to create a material here and throw this on here And yeah, smoothness is up, metallic is up. Um, let's turn on the turn the directional light back on and down. Okay. Is what are we actually reflecting here uh when we don't use a reflection probe? And all a lot of this stuff is all going to be in one. Uh it's going to be window and then environment. Um and then lighting. And here we can control what the HDR is. We did this in the ball game, right? Didn't we make a procedural sky shader? No. Okay. So we we can the wraparound environment which is contributing to both the reflections and the lighting um we can control there in addition to the mist right very similar to the mist pass in Blender which is going to be labeled as fog here in Unity um for things having some sort of limit natural limit that you can the um things just sort of wash out into the background. Um yeah, let's look at that. So in here under window rendering lighting. There we go. Render rendering lighting. It pulls up this window. So there's a lot here. And it's the environment tab. and the environment tab. Um, this is where a lot of the important things are. So, we have uh the skybox, our HDR, it has its own material. This is very analogous to Blender, right? Where there's the you switch the shader to world mode, and now you're talking about what's the thing that wraps around. Same idea. This is the material that wraps around the scene. And by default, it's that super lame just blue with like slightly bright towards the horizon shader. That's the skybox. And then also, we have this fog setting here. Um, we'll get to that in a second. Let's make our own skybox first, right? So, if I were to I think this is live, right? Can I control this character? I think all that's set up in this scene. Yeah, let's just move the camera out. There we go. Um, good. Now back here. Let's make a new sky. So this could be there's a couple there's some options here, right? So you can I think for most of your games the solution here is to use a procedural sky which allows you to control the color and uh intensity. The other option here is that you also can load HDR images like in Blender. But the problem exists where if the HDR image is anything other than just clouds, it looks terrible, right? Because you just have these like flat images of buildings or trees on the horizon that don't parallax and it looks really crappy. So uh in most of these instance HDR images just clouds um so let's look at those two options. one. Um, make your own create uh material and here this is going to be my skybox. And then here under this universal render pipeline actually I think this is yeah skybox procedural. There we go. Now, um, this is the default Unity one we're all familiar with. Um, how do I actually use this? You got to plug it into that window. And so, rendering lighting environment here. And so, if I bring this into here, you can replace the default with this one.

How much does it contribute to the lighting? How much does it contribute to the reflections? If I bounce this the whole way down, now we get much more something that's very much like our default Blender scene, right? Where the only light that's coming from that's there, right? And so now, yeah, if you haven't done anything, it's going to be completely black in there, which allows you to build the lighting for an interior scene here. So turning this off and turning this off helps quite a bit in terms of establishing that kind of kind of look. Um but being careful in terms of how much um how many lights we have there but this you know this allows you to have the most granular control over it. So important distinction here, whether we're going to look like we're inside, whether we're going to look like we're outside, it's all going to be about controlling what's happening in this one in the environment tab. You know, this and this uh allow us to be uh in total control like it's inside. The fog thing here are missed. If we go back to the other scene, the one that's outside because this usually doesn't come into play for the inside scenes. But for outside stuff, like over here, um, we can let's put the camera down at a lower angle, kind of like this. So, I'll grab the camera and control shift F. There we go. And then come back into here. here and fog. And so if I turn this on now, um, objects as they get further away can kind of get by default whited out, but it depends on what you're doing with the fog color. And so the density here, uh, holding down control, you can sort of see it's like this gradient that comes in. The only thing that's kind of, um, if you have a terrain, this will be great because like here we'll be seeing the terrain. Everything will be getting grayed out in the distance here. It's just not being applied to the uh, background by default there. But yeah, a small value here allows you to do this. But then you can change whatever you'd want the fade in the distance to be there. So very much very similar to the it's not actual, you know, it's whiting out the stuff that's in the distance. It's not creating dusty moving dynamic fog. That's going to be How would you do that? that's going to be a particle system, right?

You look at South Mountain and depending on how much smog we have that day, right? It may be more or less visible from wherever you are. Um, and so this sort of simulates that part of it, right? So the fog here uh yeah probably mostly for outside scenes usually you know like it's just not far enough so that it would work in terms of being close to where you are for the other inside scenes. the if we come back over here.

    "title": "Baked Lighting and Global Illumination",
    "video_id": null,
    "search_text": "AVC200 December 01, 2025 Baked Lighting and Global Illumination Okay, let's test this now. So now inside okay um this would be icing on the cake level right is that we don't get real time no light bounce for all the reasons we've talked about before it's expensive right but we can bounce baked light which means we premputee if you have a bunch of lights in a scene you can figure out where they would bounce And as long as the lights don't move or things don't move in front of the light to a big extent then um we can you know essentially offset our compute time. We can do a bunch of essentially frozen global illumination calculation bake that into some textures that then overlay over the entire scene. That's kind of all handled here and then you can use that. So now I've got some walls here. Let me make a ceiling too and see how this works. Um, so I'll control D this. Bring this up. And I'll bring it over. There we go. And maybe scale it in this direction as well. Okay. And now let's look. There we go. And let's come back to that window. And so now with this light in here, we'll come back to the window for lighting, rendering, lighting. Again, this is a tab. If you're going to be working a lot in it, you could just dock it somewhere. In fact, why don't I do that right here for now? And uh light maps. So, um baked light maps here. If we start to this whole system is for things that don't move. So there's a couple things we need to do. One is that usually only objects marked static, which we haven't really dealt with before, are going to be used for the calculation. And then number two, the light um also needs to be earmarked as being a light that should go into the bake system. So both those things. So our environment, let's go ahead and get the um environment marked. So I have these walls here, here, here. And this is the box up here saying that those things are static. So we've got that first part. Second part, we still only have one contributing light, this point light here. And right now, it's marked as real time, meaning that when we move around, the shadow changes over here. Uh, yeah, you can either make it totally baked, meaning that it's not going to contribute ever to real-time lighting, or mixed. And let's say mixed. And I'll also mark that static. And then if we come back to our window over here, I think we'll see a little bit more action when we go to baked like maps generate. And now you see it's doing some stuff. And then down here, this is it working on some things. Give it a second. I don't think this should take too long. And so this is very analogous to rendering. Okay. So it is um doing all that photon bouncing calculation and then storing that information in textures that it it handles essentially they get overlaid on top of the materials. There's a whole bunch of parameters here in terms of like just like any other it has to be baked into textures. If we if we use more pixels, it'll be higher resolution. Higher resolution is not necessarily looks better in this case. And we just want this general lightning information to contribute. Um, and so let's give it a second here. I think this is happening on the GPU by default. We used to have to check a box for that, but I think it's the default now. Let's look. Um, I'm not going to be able to find that box. Unity GPU There it goes. Okay. So, it did the thing, right? It's got um it created other textures that's going to be used to overlay on top. Um, and these are grayed out, I believe, because we need a new settings, right? So again, this stuff very icing on the cake. Now we have some new light settings we can use. Now we can say um don't use the CPU, use the GPU. That should make this process faster. Um and now we should be able to also bounce some more. So all this light up here is a result of, you know, the light bouncing up there, which wasn't there before. But let's add a few more things. So I've got this light fig configured correctly. Let's do some things with it. And so I'm going to move this and also increase the range here and duplicate it. Let's give it a different color. And I'm going to mark this one as only baked. Right? So see what happened right there. Right? this. Watch the shadows from mixed to where it's going to contribute to the shadows to baked where it went and the shadow the shadow from the red light went away completely. Let's come back here. Samples bounces. Let's say four. Going in integer numbers is going to be the way to go there. And let's see if we get a quicker result here now that I switched it to the GPU. It needs to configure some stuff. So, takes a second to get rolling. But once it the bar starts moving, we should see it move faster. Right. So, if you're not fairly confident about your GPU specs, again, this is not a road for you to travel down on a Chromebook. Um, I don't know. Looks like that number is moving faster now. And again, this is pretty much inside only, right? The outside, we're pretty much just going to have this one directional light. and um that's going to um be the primary source. Awesome. If we look at the baked light maps, you now you can see sort of what's happening here, right? These are the uh the lighting information that gets baked in there. This is also going to be more performant, right? So you have a lot of inside rooms um maybe there's one light in each one that's going to do the main shadowing and then the other sort of environmental stuff um is set to baked. And so now if I were to run around here, you'll see that the red light is, you know, baked. And so it's contributing to the lighting, but it's not doing the real- time shadow like the uh blue one is in this instance. And let's see, at four bounces, I think we're seeing a much more subtle but noticeable effect. If I were to delete this stuff, um, we used to have a clear button here. clear. Boom. See the difference there? Right. And so that was especially in the shadowing areas. Right. Right. The shadowing we had this much much more subtle gradation. I don't think I can control Z that. Let's see. Uh no. Okay. So gaze at unbaked lighting. Okay. So the hallmark of computer graphics, right? The shadows falling off in the complete 0000 blackness. No ambient lighting happening. And so here, I mean, it was pretty quick. So I feel confident. Let's give it another another bounce. So multiplier bounces. Let's say four. Okay. And so now I'll say generate and let it crunch through its stuff. And then watch the window here. And like the light and the bounce of the light around the scene should be better once we see it get loaded over here. And boom. Right. And so, especially up here, light mixing and everything down here, right? All of this ambient occlusion stuff. This is not I think this is the one I made 100% reflective, which is why it's still kind of weird. Where's this one? Let's not make it 100% reflective. And I'll add another light here. And again, you saw I did all of this because again, if I just would have been empty space, all the light bounces. You can crank the bounces up all you want, but then it just bounces off into nothingness, and you don't get any of that bounce around. We did this in Blender as well. Um, and so now, yeah, so a lot of you don't have massive scenes. This shouldn't be I mean, you you probably want to come in here. I did click the bake before I made a new scene setting. Don't do that. Make a new scene setting first. That way you're able to tell it from the beginning, hey, use my GPU so that it does does the baking on the GPU there because that's going to be way this is all organized much more interesting subtle mixture of light happening here, right? But again, it's all baked and so it won't sort of react. But in terms of creating a much more highfidelity lighting environment, it should be much better. Oh, this looks like garbage because it is not marked static, right? And so Unity assumes it's going to move. It doesn't want to bake a bunch of lighting onto it. Let's say that this thing is now marked static. We should get even better results on that sphere. Let's see. and we do make sense. Yeah. So this is another fundamental concept in real time computer graphics, right? like does it need to be computed at that frame? If not, like well, how how much can we time shift this? Does it need could it be computed, you know, before we even load the game, you know, in which case we can bake it into textures and just store it as data. Could it be computed like when the game is loaded? um you know offsetting the compute time to some time shifting compute so that you know you're able to do more computing by time traveling then you can um maximize a lot of stuff here right and so now we get you know this much much much more uh nuanced high fidelity lighting environment uh for our character to move around it uh if our character had a reflection probe on it here or a light probe, we might be able to get some better results on the character here. But I mean, you've all intuitively seen this in games, right? Where this has been used for a long time now, right? In order because you could premputee a lot of things, right? This is why mo, you know, until rather recently a lot of games didn't involve like the sun moving across the sky during the level, right? Well, because that requires mean that you need to calculate all the lighting that frame, right? Or somewhat close. And so, um, yeah. Uh, and I believe this also takes into account emissive objects that not not just lights. So for instance panels on uh control readouts if I were to make a new thing here like this one of these and bring it down. There it is. Bring this down like so. uh give this its own material. Um light. Again, this isn't the way to cast light into the scene, but more as an environmental effect. And so now we get yes emission, yes, glowing green. There we go. Put this on this thing. There we go. It's activating the bloom, but it's not on the floor there. And so now, if I were to let's just make it super strong, so it's super obvious. Like so. And now if I were to uh re-ake the lighting, the bigger the scene, the longer this will take. Okay. If you do it the first time and this is moving at some snail's pace, maybe this is not the best path forward. But now, oh no, nope. This is not going to work yet because we didn't mark that object as static. I don't think it's going to contribute to the map. So, let's make sure we mark that object as static. And now bake it again. There we go. And so now in over here, you know, being able to see these while they, you know, up until now probably looked pretty cryptic, you know, now you can sort of make sense of what this is, right? Um, no. much glowier, right? The glow glowy things are much more legit glowy now at this point. Now, the thing that this again you you opt into fidelity and you opt out of animation in that way, right? Because if we were to is it going to let us do this? We were to turn this off, right? It does. I mean, that's kind of neat just as the effect here, but like right the it doesn't adjust this because now that's baked in essentially that's baked into the floor texture or you know like it's a texture that gets laid on top of whatever texture I put on the floor at that point. Um, and so as long as it's something that stays put like the control panel um lights and stuff like that, this uh works great for that kind of thing. >> Yes. No, I mean you would just it would you would not mark it static >> and then just animate the this and but so it wouldn't the there there's a whole there's a separate system for quasi real time global elimination in the URP stuff like that's very recent like the last couple of years. Um, we haven't turned that on. In the Unity HDRP platform, you know, with the other type of rendering, having real-time global illumination is a possibility. But, um, yeah, if your game if you knew your game was just going to PC and was not going to be played anywhere else, then, you know, maybe. But by default using our setup, no, you can't. Um, these are static textures. Cool. All right. So, water, shaders, lighting, baked lighting. Baked lighting if you want to go down that path again primarily is going to be most impactful for inside stuff where the light's bouncing around, right? you know, outside it just unless you're in a cave. So, B may benefit from this, right? Because he actually has that inside space. Um, then uh this, you know, really creates a much more high fidelity environment. The baking profile here is sort of like the one one of the parameters is how many pixels are restoring this, you know, for this stuff because you can kind of see here that it's a little bit, you know, you can tell a little bit what's happening there. But in general, it still looks way better than it did without the baked lighting. Um, yeah. Okay. And then uh Wednesday, see",
    "transcript_segment": "Okay, let's test this now. So now inside okay um this would be icing on the cake level right is that we don't get real time no light bounce for all the reasons we've talked about before it's expensive right but we can bounce baked light which means we premputee if you have a bunch of lights in a scene you can figure out where they would bounce And as long as the lights don't move or things don't move in front of the light to a big extent then um we can you know essentially offset our compute time.

So our environment, let's go ahead and get the um environment marked. So I have these walls here, here, here. And this is the box up here saying that those things are static. So we've got that first part. Second part, we still only have one contributing light, this point light here. And right now, it's marked as real time, meaning that when we move around, the shadow changes over here. Uh, yeah, you can either make it totally baked, meaning that it's not going to contribute ever to real-time lighting, or mixed. And let's say mixed. And I'll also mark that static. And then if we come back to our window over here, I think we'll see a little bit more action when we go to baked like maps generate. And now you see it's doing some stuff. And then down here, this is it working on some things. Give it a second. I don't think this should take too long. And so this is very analogous to rendering. Okay. So it is um doing all that photon bouncing calculation and then storing that information in textures that it it handles essentially they get overlaid on top of the materials. There's a whole bunch of parameters here in terms of like just like any other it has to be baked into textures. If we if we use more pixels, it'll be higher resolution. Higher resolution is not necessarily looks better in this case. And we just want this general lightning information to contribute. Um, and so let's give it a second here. I think this is happening on the GPU by default. We used to have to check a box for that, but I think it's the default now. Let's look. Um, I'm not going to be able to find that box. Unity GPU There it goes. Okay. So, it did the thing, right? It's got um it created other textures that's going to be used to overlay on top. Um, and these are grayed out, I believe, because we need a new settings, right? So again, this stuff very icing on the cake. Now we have some new light settings we can use. Now we can say um don't use the CPU, use the GPU. That should make this process faster. Um and now we should be able to also bounce some more. So all this light up here is a result of, you know, the light bouncing up there, which wasn't there before. But let's add a few more things. So I've got this light fig configured correctly. Let's do some things with it. And so I'm going to move this and also increase the range here and duplicate it. Let's give it a different color. And I'm going to mark this one as only baked. Right? So see what happened right there. Right? this. Watch the shadows from mixed to where it's going to contribute to the shadows to baked where it went and the shadow the shadow from the red light went away completely. Let's come back here. Samples bounces. Let's say four. Going in integer numbers is going to be the way to go there. And let's see if we get a quicker result here now that I switched it to the GPU. It needs to configure some stuff. So, takes a second to get rolling. But once it the bar starts moving, we should see it move faster. Right. So, if you're not fairly confident about your GPU specs, again, this is not a road for you to travel down on a Chromebook. Um, I don't know. Looks like that number is moving faster now. And again, this is pretty much inside only, right? The outside, we're pretty much just going to have this one directional light. and um that's going to um be the primary source. Awesome. If we look at the baked light maps, you now you can see sort of what's happening here, right? These are the uh the lighting information that gets baked in there. This is also going to be more performant, right? So you have a lot of inside rooms um maybe there's one light in each one that's going to do the main shadowing and then the other sort of environmental stuff um is set to baked. And so now if I were to run around here, you'll see that the red light is, you know, baked. And so it's contributing to the lighting, but it's not doing the real- time shadow like the uh blue one is in this instance. And let's see, at four bounces, I think we're seeing a much more subtle but noticeable effect. If I were to delete this stuff, um, we used to have a clear button here. clear. Boom. See the difference there? Right. And so that was especially in the shadowing areas. Right. Right. The shadowing we had this much much more subtle gradation. I don't think I can control Z that. Let's see. Uh no. Okay. So gaze at unbaked lighting. Okay. So the hallmark of computer graphics, right? The shadows falling off in the complete 0000 blackness. No ambient lighting happening. And so here, I mean, it was pretty quick. So I feel confident. Let's give it another another bounce. So multiplier bounces. Let's say four. Okay. And so now I'll say generate and let it crunch through its stuff. And then watch the window here. And like the light and the bounce of the light around the scene should be better once we see it get loaded over here. And boom. Right. And so, especially up here, light mixing and everything down here, right? All of this ambient occlusion stuff. This is not I think this is the one I made 100% reflective, which is why it's still kind of weird. Where's this one? Let's not make it 100% reflective. And I'll add another light here. And again, you saw I did all of this because again, if I just would have been empty space, all the light bounces. You can crank the bounces up all you want, but then it just bounces off into nothingness, and you don't get any of that bounce around. We did this in Blender as well. Um, and so now, yeah, so a lot of you don't have massive scenes. This shouldn't be I mean, you you probably want to come in here. I did click the bake before I made a new scene setting. Don't do that. Make a new scene setting first. That way you're able to tell it from the beginning, hey, use my GPU so that it does does the baking on the GPU there because that's going to be way this is all organized much more interesting subtle mixture of light happening here, right? But again, it's all baked and so it won't sort of react. But in terms of creating a much more highfidelity lighting environment, it should be much better. Oh, this looks like garbage because it is not marked static, right? And so Unity assumes it's going to move. It doesn't want to bake a bunch of lighting onto it. Let's say that this thing is now marked static. We should get even better results on that sphere. Let's see. and we do make sense. Yeah. So this is another fundamental concept in real time computer graphics, right? like does it need to be computed at that frame? If not, like well, how how much can we time shift this? Does it need could it be computed, you know, before we even load the game, you know, in which case we can bake it into textures and just store it as data. Could it be computed like when the game is loaded? um you know offsetting the compute time to some time shifting compute so that you know you're able to do more computing by time traveling then you can um maximize a lot of stuff here right and so now we get you know this much much much more uh nuanced high fidelity lighting environment uh for our character to move around it uh if our character had a reflection probe on it here or a light probe, we might be able to get some better results on the character here. But I mean, you've all intuitively seen this in games, right? Where this has been used for a long time now, right? In order because you could premputee a lot of things, right? This is why mo, you know, until rather recently a lot of games didn't involve like the sun moving across the sky during the level, right? Well, because that requires mean that you need to calculate all the lighting that frame, right? Or somewhat close. And so, um, yeah. Uh, and I believe this also takes into account emissive objects that not not just lights. So for instance panels on uh control readouts if I were to make a new thing here like this one of these and bring it down. There it is. Bring this down like so. uh give this its own material. Um light. Again, this isn't the way to cast light into the scene, but more as an environmental effect. And so now we get yes emission, yes, glowing green. There we go. Put this on this thing. There we go. It's activating the bloom, but it's not on the floor there. And so now, if I were to let's just make it super strong, so it's super obvious. Like so. And now if I were to uh re-ake the lighting, the bigger the scene, the longer this will take. Okay. If you do it the first time and this is moving at some snail's pace, maybe this is not the best path forward. But now, oh no, nope. This is not going to work yet because we didn't mark that object as static. I don't think it's going to contribute to the map. So, let's make sure we mark that object as static. And now bake it again. There we go. And so now in over here, you know, being able to see these while they, you know, up until now probably looked pretty cryptic, you know, now you can sort of make sense of what this is, right? Um, no. much glowier, right? The glow glowy things are much more legit glowy now at this point. Now, the thing that this again you you opt into fidelity and you opt out of animation in that way, right? Because if we were to is it going to let us do this? We were to turn this off, right? It does. I mean, that's kind of neat just as the effect here, but like right the it doesn't adjust this because now that's baked in essentially that's baked into the floor texture or you know like it's a texture that gets laid on top of whatever texture I put on the floor at that point. Um, and so as long as it's something that stays put like the control panel um lights and stuff like that, this uh works great for that kind of thing. >> Yes. No, I mean you would just it would you would not mark it static >> and then just animate the this and but so it wouldn't the there there's a whole there's a separate system for quasi real time global elimination in the URP stuff like that's very recent like the last couple of years. Um, we haven't turned that on. In the Unity HDRP platform, you know, with the other type of rendering, having real-time global illumination is a possibility. But, um, yeah, if your game if you knew your game was just going to PC and was not going to be played anywhere else, then, you know, maybe. But by default using our setup, no, you can't. Um, these are static textures. Cool. All right. So, water, shaders, lighting, baked lighting. Baked lighting if you want to go down that path again primarily is going to be most impactful for inside stuff where the light's bouncing around, right? you know, outside it just unless you're in a cave. So, B may benefit from this, right? Because he actually has that inside space. Um, then uh this, you know, really creates a much more high fidelity environment. The baking profile here is sort of like the one one of the parameters is how many pixels are restoring this, you know, for this stuff because you can kind of see here that it's a little bit, you know, you can tell a little bit what's happening there. But in general, it still looks way better than it did without the baked lighting. Um, yeah. Okay. And then uh Wednesday, see"

It allows us to it's multi- channelannel and can accommodate a higher bit depth. PGs can also um work with higher bit depths but um are that format is limited to RGBA EXR channels uh when it's a multi- channelannel EXR I don't think there's a limit there's no functional limit that I've ever run into here right and so instead of having all of your path passes as separate piles of files um just having one file, one image sequence that contains all of whatever info you want, right?

In the render settings, we also set up uh open EXR multilayer float half, right? So float half float full is related to the bit depth issue where you for the most part when we're talking about storing numbers in the computer we can think of them as being having this infinite range like numbers in math do in the actual execution of this that's not possible we don't have infinite storage in the computer and so the maximum range you can represent is limited by how many bits you actually um allocate to store the number. This is not something that you know you run up against unless you're writing software on a regular basis uh in the programs. And so obviously the more bits you have the more places you can store and in this case the more resolution you could have. But um yeah half is going to be enough bits for us in this instance right because this is higher quality but it is going to be you know compared to our usual outputting of JPEGs or outputting of MP4s or outputting of PGs even this is going to be much more data and so especially when we get to After Effects um those of you who don't have a separate uh drive for data.

But let's say we needed to do something where we needed to uh combine mats over here, right? where we had, you know, separate passes that we wanted to combine. And so our workflow here is that we want to pre-MP, not pre-amp, that's different. Pre-Mmp all mats. Um, and we want to brighten the ones with the other ones. And so we want to almost certainly put them all in add mode which allow would allow you to you know create you know mats out of other combined mats right so and then we would use the pre-MP as a track mat. Okay. So, we want to pre uh let's label these so that we know what we're doing. I can't stress this enough. Like labeling stuff in After Effects is critically important. Okay.

    "search_text": "AVC240 December 01, 2025 Alpha Mats vs Luma Mats Next is the topic which you need to understand. Alpha mats versus luma mats. Okay. And so this just comes down to, you know, when we're using a mat or a mask here, the visual language is always show me the white, hide the black stuff, right? The difference here is where are we reading this black and white from? And so in an alphamat, uh, we are only looking in the alpha channel. But as you now know, not all images have alpha channels, right? Right. There's the RGB where there's the color and then there can optionally be the second the fourth alpha channel where we store this separate transparency information. Um when we use a lumat we are looking at the brightness of the RGB channels. So in this case, um, you know, this button is a toggle. So I mean, you could just jam it until you see what you want and then call it a day. Uh, or like how would we actually make some sort of knowledge about what's happening here in After Effects? We can choose what we're seeing here, right? And so in this allows us to look at individual channels, the brightness of the red, the brightness of the green, brightness of the blue in this case, all the same. And then also separately look at the alpha channel. The alpha channel here is the entire frame because the mask data when we saved the mask data it stored it as just color data in the RGB it you know it doesn't this is where it can just you know program to program even within the environment you just need to be paying attention to what's happening here a lot of times when you have scalar data one of the One of the popular default behaviors is that I just take the same, for whatever reason, instead of just storing one channel worth of black and white data, I take the black and white data and I copy it to the RGB channels and I store it three times. That's obviously not the most efficient way to do it, but it happens a lot in these systems. And so um in that case that's what happened here where we routed the mat which is gray to the gray channel but then in the EXR saving format it did save it as you know just the same black and white information this black and white information in the red the green and the blue channels. And so that's why over here in order to read that stuff, we want it to be a uh luma mat, right? Because that's where the mask information is. And so once we go back to looking at everything here, this is put back to lumamat. And then this is turned back on. Now it actually cuts out our um character using all of the all of the stuff, right? And so now we can process our character completely separately from the background. And so here uh on this one, you know, it doesn't need to have the mat like this essentially just becomes the uh background, right? And so even without any depth of field, like super cheap depth of field, like essentially binary depth of field is like blur the background and keep the front thing in focus, right? And so you know, no special depth map, just gouge blur on uh the background here, right? And yeah, it uh works to some not blurring our front character simply because you know it is doing it but it's being covered up by you know the cutout that's in front here. Or if we want to take the character and change color, we get the hue saturation on this one and we could change the color of the character and that's limited to just that background. Make sense there, right? So yeah, clicky, but I mean not having to load a whole bunch of separate passes and just being able to access them as you would like, I think is pretty, you know, this is the simplest option now, especially, right? I mean, regardless of how you've been doing it up until this point, right? Unless you know you're really confident in the way everything's set up in Blender and it's been working for you like rendering out your image sequences and then you know maybe you use some of the Blender effects and you bake them in and then you also bring over some other passes here to assemble the entire sequence in After Effects. I think it's just uh the Blender editing in terms of just like changing where shots start and shots end and all of that business is just easier over here. Especially if you've, you know, if you took 184 here at GCC and you did a bunch of After Effects, you've got some reasonable amount of familiarity here with After Effects.

Yeah, I'm not going to be able to put it in here because this is in my system drive which I don't have access I don't have permissions for on the school computer. I'll try and check it out at home between now and Wednesday, but it looks promising. Setting up your own chromatic aberration, just a matter of setting up each um RGB layer and then displacing it and then adding it back in. But it gets laborious there. And having something to work with just like we do over on the Blender side is super advantageous. And yeah, um it's just most a lot of pe almost everyone using After Effects has some additional After Effects plugins and it's almost always one of those. Hence its absence here from the typical um After Effects list of stuff. But those three things and then again keeping the film grain last. And this is I would say way too strong here, right? This would be some sort of subtle effect. And also remember that we're kind of playing both sides of the of the game here in that uh the grain is um increasing uh variation per pixel. Right? But but this we're going to export this using media encoder using the YouTube settings, right? Which is going to run a lossy compressor essentially working against this. So yeah, having a grain effect on there to at least introduce some of this you'll need to be aware of. But then you know in terms of whether all of that grain is going to be meticulously represented in the output like certainly not with the g with the with the given YouTube compression settings right um so the main issue here right composition once you're all done you know it's like let's say hypothetically you know like our final on the 17th and it's like let's say it's like 1:30 a.m. hypothetically on the 17th um hypothetically and and you're trying to output the final media encoder um step and we come over here to add to",
    "transcript_segment": "that's the red giant one. Let's see. I'm surprised. So for After Effects, AE scripts is the home of, you know, the After Effects marketplace. Um, yeah, let's see. I think this updates as is now so that it um I be able to load it live. Yeah, I'm not going to be able to put it in here because this is in my system drive which I don't have access I don't have permissions for on the school computer. I'll try and check it out at home between now and Wednesday, but it looks promising. Setting up your own chromatic aberration, just a matter of setting up each um RGB layer and then displacing it and then adding it back in. But it gets laborious there. And having something to work with just like we do over on the Blender side is super advantageous. And yeah, um it's just most a lot of pe almost everyone using After Effects has some additional After Effects plugins and it's almost always one of those. Hence its absence here from the typical um After Effects list of stuff. But those three things and then again keeping the film grain last. And this is I would say way too strong here, right? This would be some sort of subtle effect. And also remember that we're kind of playing both sides of the of the game here in that uh the grain is um increasing uh variation per pixel. Right? But but this we're going to export this using media encoder using the YouTube settings, right? Which is going to run a lossy compressor essentially working against this.

Uh this is where you would want to do the lossy compression, right? And your workflow may involve some other pit stops here in other programs. At all of this part, you'd want all of this handoff to be as lossless as possible and then only making it lossy at the end, the publishing stage, right? um regardless of what happens in the future, this will remain the same, right? You want to not lose quality while you're working on all this stuff. And so it's important to realize what are the loss lossy formats here. MP4, although it's slightly more complicated than that, MP4 is like a container. You can have different codecs in an MP4, but for the most part, it's going to be shrunken in size. and then JPEG for sure, right? And so if you're sending JPEGs between programs the whole way through your workflow, you're definitely ending up with less of the original data than you start off with, right? So, um, and then over here, like in terms of how lossy is it, right? How much data am I losing? the further you move this to the right to allocate more space for it. Uh the only trade-off is it's a bigger file. Now, and the other thing to keep in mind is that uh unless you know you are self-hosting this file, meaning like you're putting it on a server that you control and people are just streaming it as is from that server that uh it's going to be recompressed, right? Right? If you put it on any social media platform or YouTube in particular, right, they they take the compressed file and they compress it again so that they can um you know they're serving it's really important for them to be minimizing the amount of data they're transferring because they're probably transferring more data than like anyone on Earth. Like probably in aggregate like it's got to be close to that and certainly one of the top five, right? Um, and so, uh, so yeah, I mean that's a moving target in terms of like what is YouTube doing like you can watch I'm sure weekly YouTube videos and about like whatever they're doing with the compression now this week because because it's changing all the time but obviously they want it to look decent, right?

Yeah, it looks great. The the stuff popping up is super cool. I feel like Do we just do we just see it in that one shot? >> Like the thing coming out of the ground? Do we see the other ones come out of the ground and the one going around? Okay, we do. But it's kind of happening like directly in front of the camera. >> I mean it I I didn't notice I mean I was seeing them when they were in my peripheral vision but like because you know we're seeing the flat side of them here like I didn't notice it the first time. Uh, so there's that the and then you you have a plan for the rendering difference between the two or is this is this what you want in terms of like the this character looking all NPR and this one looking not? >> I'll try to tweak, but that's But I'm I'm not sure which one which one do you want. You want both of them to look like this. Is that what >> that would be more ideal? Yeah. So this this is the the >> Okay. >> Uhhuh. And then so this one Yeah. So the okay yeah so there is some quantizing of what's happening here using the like ramping thing of the shadow information over top of the color channel. That's what you're doing. The I mean the the main thing I mean one of the main things is the outline, right? So just putting like this character this shader has Yeah. Like just the grease a thin grease pencil line will go a long way to visually making these things look similar. Um then Um, Yeah. I mean, part of it is the modeling of the nose and stuff is different on the other one. And so in this one, what did you do? You took the light information from that diffuse and then put it into a ramp and then multiply that by just the regular output of the um color texture, right? Um, so yeah, a lot of the sections of this character are, you know, like there's very no there's almost no gradation in color there. So I think the dither is there a dither node? I think there's a dither node. Let's look at it here. Let's look at this. There's no dither node. I mean, the thing that comes to mind immediately is like taking the color texture and um just opening it up in uh Illustrator and then running uh live trace because that gives you the options like that's pretty option feature full environment in terms of like I want you to crunch it down to four colors or three colors and yeah it shouldn't you know like and And you just replace the existing color texture with that totally flat one. And between that and the outline, I think that would get close-ish to certainly much closer. Right. Okay. And then uh the other things that stick out here, the live shot, the wide shots at the beginning that are static um feel like after watching it twice like like it like it's a weird drop in energy versus like how much visual energy the whole thing has, which is quite a lot. Right. you have you're you're either you know there's parts where the editing is super super dense. We're getting a lot of shots per second or you know m they seem very short and it works I think but then at the beginning we have like these what now definitely stick out like this one this one to some extent here where you know like they really just seem to not match the energy level of the rest of the project there in terms of what because like what are we supposed to be there's nothing to sort of carry it here, right? We're not close enough to any of the characters for them to like have a big impact on the visual energy in the frame. And then um yeah, like that that those so some sort of you know movement here I think would work. The lip syncing >> camera movement. >> Yeah, camera movement. Yeah. This one also doesn't seem to have any depth of field to it, which yeah, I think when when that happens, it just kind of like undermines the sense of scale you're trying to communicate. Um in terms of you know like lowhanging fruit for the lip syncing stuff. I think the last thing this character says it just seemed like you missed a word. There's like something it is that in the lyrics there. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean they're pretty far away. We're moving around a lot. And so the specific mouth shapes are useful but I mean the low level of mouth sync like mouth open when sound come out is like the main thing you want to get there. Um and then yeah the like blinking the opening and closing of the mouth tend to be fast right and so when this is the other low hanging fruit thing like when we had the shot either this shot or the one before where we were on this car yeah this one it seemed like there was like this really what looked like awkwardly slow interpolation from mouth shape to mouth shape there regardless of the specific specific shapes. Um, yeah. So, when do you even need the the chains? Definitely in that in this shot, right? That's where we need the chains for sure. Yeah. So, here the lighting, right? You know, like like we're the character is really falling off into, you know, like 100% silhouette back there. Um the textures in the environment look like you took the next step up in terms of polish there. it except in one. You didn't change anything about the marble texture here in this shot. It's the same same as before. Just like all of a sudden it looks low res. You know, looking at in the other shots, it looks fine, fine, fine, fine. But then here it doesn't seem like it should be that pixelated based on how close we are. But you might be able to fix that with just changing the tiling for this shot. I mean, what's the structure of the Blender files like? Um, each object is filed. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, the good news is here I don't think like as long as you can get the initial condition set up pretty well, you're probably going to need a little more slack on the chain, then I mean she's not flowing around wildly. So, so that should all help. Yeah. I I mean the pacing and the editing and the general shot selection is good besides these couple shot wide shots at the beginning which seem to really didn't have sort of match the visual energy of the rest of it. The main thing here is kind of like the the lighting of this big space is a little Do you have a reference that you're working with here or anything like let's look at some spaces? This Yeah. So, there is some some kind of texture here on the walls and the floors. May I think it's maybe the you know like the noise pattern feels like really like this is too big to be like, you know, like the pattern of the concrete. It's more like a stain on it or something. And so something like that like Okay. So, you made this with like a noise like a Blender shader noise or something. >> It changed. >> Yeah. >> So, I had to throw that together. >> Yeah. Because what what what is There's windows. >> Okay. >> A light lay outside. Yeah. I mean, I I think part of what might make this look like the the banners help I think like some columns or something >> would help communicate the scale of the space and then yeah really trying to find you know a concrete texture with maybe like panel on it, right? So like like we could choose carefully choose the scale of the concrete paneling to really sort of communicate the scale of the space, right? Because regardless there's always this, you know, pattern from the construction, you know, like this square, there's this room. God, what was it? What the hell was the name of that? Yeah. Yeah, at one point I had proposed something for this space and then the Sydney/Australian government decided to get rid of it. Um, the whole space, not just the event, but it's like this absurdly large, you know, quasi interior um, concrete space. case. I mean, I think this is kind of the problem with it. Um, yeah, like that that's like a full-size car, right? Like, you know, it's like in some cases well in excess of like airplane hanger dimensions and it was supposed to be some sort of like pocket, you know, but you know, like these things read as like these giant columns because they got, you know, like this this patterning on them. Um, so yeah, something like that I think would start to communicate the scale like some so big, you know, and you could just put them out of the way so they don't mess with any of the existing shots. Um, and yeah, and then in addition to that, uh, I mean, do you have the rate tracing turned on? Make sure that that's turned on. And look at the because you do have an inside space with the light coming in. That's going to make uh a big difference, right? Because the most naturalistic thing is going to be that light coming in through the windows, which is going to give you some cool shading. Save. Okay, this block is now. Let's get rid of this one. Let's make a new one. It's like I don't know 50 meters. Okay. And so now we're inside Make a hole. And make a All right. So, we have the light coming in here from this hole, but unless we turn on ray tracing. Right now, it's bouncing a little bit. And then in addition here what we talked about before we want more light. There we go. And then under Yeah. So steps here are sort of number of bounces inside. So yeah, that would go a long way to making that light look like it's actually lighting the internal part of the space along uh yeah and you know maybe making a volume if there's not already a volume to just sort of see because I mean that's the other part I think is really going to be useful is you know the volumetric light shining down spotlight on both characters probably then um probably turning that off while you're working so it's not you know clogging the the work mode but um yeah that'll give you that I think between the concrete ray tracing in some volutric light coming in through those windows all that's going to start to communicate the scale of the thing because you kind of I think you've built stuff you've blocked it out correctly, but and it looks of the right scale, but just a handful of other things. There may be some big columns, right? That you know, like they need that that part of it is also like you need in order to have this big space like most of the time it needs support. You can't just make a giant box out of just a box. Like I'm not an architect, but like from what I understand that's how it works. You don't want to have falling on people. So there is that. Cool. All right, that's coming along. You didn't totally skip Thanksgiving dinner for Oregon on that, right? >> Thanksgiving. Cool. All right. And then calendar",

May I think it's maybe the you know like the noise pattern feels like really like this is too big to be like, you know, like the pattern of the concrete. It's more like a stain on it or something. And so something like that like Okay. So, you made this with like a noise like a Blender shader noise or something. >> It changed. >> Yeah. >> So, I had to throw that together. >> Yeah. Because what what what is There's windows. >> Okay. >> A light lay outside. Yeah. I mean, I I think part of what might make this look like the the banners help I think like some columns or something >> would help communicate the scale of the space and then yeah really trying to find you know a concrete texture with maybe like panel on it, right? So like like we could choose carefully choose the scale of the concrete paneling to really sort of communicate the scale of the space, right? Because regardless there's always this, you know, pattern from the construction, you know, like this square, there's this room. God, what was it? What the hell was the name of that? Yeah. Yeah, at one point I had proposed something for this space and then the Sydney/Australian government decided to get rid of it. Um, the whole space, not just the event, but it's like this absurdly large, you know, quasi interior um, concrete space. case. I mean, I think this is kind of the problem with it. Um, yeah, like that that's like a full-size car, right? Like, you know, it's like in some cases well in excess of like airplane hanger dimensions and it was supposed to be some sort of like pocket, you know, but you know, like these things read as like these giant columns because they got, you know, like this this patterning on them. Um, so yeah, something like that I think would start to communicate the scale like some so big, you know, and you could just put them out of the way so they don't mess with any of the existing shots. Um, and yeah, and then in addition to that, uh, I mean, do you have the rate tracing turned on? Make sure that that's turned on. And look at the because you do have an inside space with the light coming in. That's going to make uh a big difference, right? Because the most naturalistic thing is going to be that light coming in through the windows, which is going to give you some cool shading. Save. Okay, this block is now. Let's get rid of this one. Let's make a new one. It's like I don't know 50 meters. Okay. And so now we're inside Make a hole. And make a All right. So, we have the light coming in here from this hole, but unless we turn on ray tracing. Right now, it's bouncing a little bit. And then in addition here what we talked about before we want more light. There we go. And then under Yeah. So steps here are sort of number of bounces inside. So yeah, that would go a long way to making that light look like it's actually lighting the internal part of the space along uh yeah and you know maybe making a volume if there's not already a volume to just sort of see because I mean that's the other part I think is really going to be useful is you know the volumetric light shining down spotlight on both characters probably then um probably turning that off while you're working so it's not you know clogging the the work mode but um yeah that'll give you that I think between the concrete ray tracing in some volutric light coming in through those windows all that's going to start to communicate the scale of the thing because you kind of I think you've built stuff you've blocked it out correctly, but and it looks of the right scale, but just a handful of other things. There may be some big columns, right? That you know, like they need that that part of it is also like you need in order to have this big space like most of the time it needs support. You can't just make a giant box out of just a box. Like I'm not an architect, but like from what I understand that's how it works. You don't want to have falling on people. So there is that. Cool. All right, that's coming along. You didn't totally skip Thanksgiving dinner for Oregon on that, right? >> Thanksgiving. Cool. All right. And then calendar"

And so bring suggesting those projects, bring those to the forefront. Like I know with the place Gavin's going now that Lena was at last semester, the semester before, I don't remember. Um, you know, like I don't think that horse conservancy had the idea of having a motion graphic video about their horse work. Um, and she sort of brought that to the table there. So especially at the beginning being prepared about that. The a lot of the creative work in town runs through creative circle. So this is um one of the the main like sort of create creative staffing agency uh in town. So, when I did our uh program review 30-page document last spring, they school and a couple other places provided some data about like where were people getting jobs and so on and so forth. And um there was some systemic issues with how the data is collected. But one of the things that came back is that like it's the number one place for a lot of people in terms of work was like quoteunquote working at Creative Circle, but it's just a matter of creative circle always grabbing all the jobs before they go out on our main calls here, right? Um and so beyond that, um the main places, you know, one, uh if you want to stay here in town, um you know, registering with and getting to know everybody at um Oh my gosh, make the font a different color. There we go. Uh, creative circle alerts, the Google job posting. You can uh set up, you know, like keyword, send me an email if anyone posts anything with animation, motion graphics, blah blah blah, visual effects. Um, I have one of those set up. Um, looking at all um the major uh uh teams in town, Diamondbacks were hiring recently. They had a motion graphics position. I encouraged several people to apply for. I'm not sure what's going on with that. Um uh the you know because in town this is a lot of this where a lot of things are happening. sports venues, the casinos. I know that there is a motion graphics position just last spring over at um one of them. I'm not at the casinos. I mean, I kind of know which ones are which, but like the one that's over here, >> there was a Desert Diamond one, but then there's there's one that starts with like a V. I can't remember what it was, but anyways, it's over there. It's by by um Cardinal Place um and connected to creative circle the what is it? two other ones. So there is creative there's two events that happen on a they used to be happening on a monthly basis. I'm not entirely sure if they still are. Uh, creative mornings is an event that moves around um and created the um the Phoenix Arizona design a G a um Arizona Institute of Graphics Arts and then what is the other one called Now, they changed the name of it and I forget what it is now. There's a second monthly creative event. So, a lot of people don't want to hear this. I mean, it's a big town. This is the sixth largest, used to be the sixth largest city in the United States, but it's not New York. It's a smaller creative circle of people. Uh, so I've typed it three times. Um yeah, again you all if you're doing the degree program, you all need to do the portfolio class or the creative professional development class. Um like this once again like being good at this stuff is important. You should be good at it, but this is also as important, right? And so, um, yeah, getting out there and getting the lay of the land, right? So, I'm loosely in touch with a lot of the freelancing. I'm not, you know, I do my own stuff. So, like it's like I don't, you know, I'm not engaged in the same way. The other awful part is like right now it's it's one of the driest, you know, like I've seen this go through, you know, es and flows and we are in a dry season and I wish I had any real actionable evidence or reason as to what exactly is happening right now. But yeah, there's not a lot of people being hired for stuff. uh it feels like everyone's kind of waiting, but it's totally unclear what we're all waiting for at this point. So, there's that part of it. You know, just to be totally 100% real, like a bunch of our really great alumni who I would bring in pre brought in in previous semesters, like a uncomfortably large number of them have been laid off from their jobs in the last, you know, nine months. Uh and they, you know, like it wasn't because they weren't good. They were all like real good, you know, like really good. Even when they were here, I was like, \"Yeah, yeah, you're great. You should go find your job.\" And they did. And then every, you know, like all of the stuff is happening. Um, and you know what is happening? You know, everyone wants to write a lot of articles about like the the AI thing. I don't know if that's actually happening yet. I mean, I think that will be a thing, but it still, you know, isn't I I I haven't seen any anecdotal evidence of someone wanting to do it on a large scale where they were able to use that the uh stable diffusion technology to do completely replace people on like an artistic level. like it just doesn't besides that Coca-Cola ad that everyone hates like it just isn't happening. And then they made another one this year. I saw it the other this this week that looks like pretty indistinguishable from the other one. Like I don't I mean they're selling Coca-Cola. So like what I mean do they even really need to make a Christmas ad? I mean people are going to buy it regardless, right? So but nevertheless they doubled down on that and made another one. Um but on a local basis, yeah, I haven't seen a lot of people who are even maybe hip enough to know to be able to replace people in that way like for these kind for this kind of work, right? Um, so it does feel like it's a lot of other stuff, you know, all of the things, tariffs, all of the news is like the inflation, the the the economy, everyone would be saying how bad the economy was if it wasn't for all the AI infrastructure propping up the spending numbers or whatever. And so, yeah, anecdotally, it is dry. And so it's definitely a good time to do the maximal num amount of this, right? Um because this is the other the one thing that AI is definitely doing is polluting the job application process. that is 100% more awful than it was a year ago in terms of you know everyone's using it to apply and then I it seems like a lot of people are using it to sort on the other end. So that's terrible like all around like like the idea that like I'm having my bot write letters that your bot reads and sort you know like this is clearly not the future we want to go to but you know I have very little control over this. No one asked me. Uh so the but that is definitely one of the issues and so strategically there networking and knowing about the jobs that are not posted is I I would in all instances going forward here try to control my own destiny and not rely ly a lot on responding to massive open calls in terms of job postings in terms of all of the other things. Sure, if something seems like really tasty, then maybe taking the time to apply because it doesn't, you know, it takes time to apply to all these things. This job, it should take time, right? So, if you're not already, you I mean, I'm Michelle tells everyone this like every job should have its own letter, right? Um, that's you want you want to be absolutely certain you get filtered out by the bot. Like don't write a letter specifically for that position. You've got to craft that in each instance.

Um yeah, they actually have a cool website. Um they're on it's like what camel back and 24th Street or something something like that. Um yeah, like one of the major design firms, uh one of our uh somebody who comes in from time to time here, um runs flock of pixels. Another I mean, this is kind of a much smaller shot, but he does a great job. Um the I think it's just down to LinkedIn. You should have a LinkedIn profile. you know, in terms of like the unending churn of, you know, trying to garner attention on there, like in some ways I'm more positive about LinkedIn because at least it's being transparently transparently transactional in that everyone's about job stuff there. So, it seems slightly less polluted than other social media, but um you know, you should at least have a way for people to get a hold of you through LinkedIn, whether or not how much you need to participate and post and all that other business. But um yeah, the process right now is so iffy that yeah, I mean I've heard different statistics about this in the past in terms of like the number of jobs you not posted, but there's so many issues like how do we know if they're not posted and like what constitutes a job? because a lot of this kind of stuff in here is going to be you know contract um based work you know freelance kind of things. So those would be my main places to start. And yeah, the like the other main issue here, especially because of this application situation, like meeting people in person, like I I can't overate how valuable that be for you in terms of like establishing those relationships. And then B, that immediately puts you in the puts you in a totally different category than the deluge of applications online, right? The the online experience seems less and less tethered to whatever the reality of the situation is with each passing day. Yeah. because like you like I have a small business in terms of like you know like my art stuff like it's like techn like an actual legal small business and everything and so like the but I you know it's not it's just an NT under which I do that work but the degree which has become a target for scamming and spamming like over the last year has gotten crazy like um I've gotten a couple of like really, you know, like notice it. It was all laughable before Nigerian princesses and, you know, whatever. But now, like people are clearly pointing the LLMs at like uh a much more sophisticated fishing schemes and stuff like that. Um, and you know, I only see part of that because mine, you know, like it's it's not that publicly visible. like Jen's small business is just delused with that stuff in terms of like fake and the other part of it is like I don't really see most of them are not like so send me your credit card number you know like that like it it seems like either they're playing some like much longer con that I like just don't understand or I I don't even understand what the purpose of the scamming was here like what what are you even getting out of this besides wasting my time. Um but um yeah definitely I mean step one creative circle for sure right because you're finishing and finishing you're not transferring right you're transferring >> don't know yet okay are you transferring >> okay N >> probably not >> probably notation So yeah, I mean the creative identity in in yeah it's particularly dry time but knowing especially a lot of students who have been successful coming out of here the first chunk of time is about piecing together a couple different things, right? There's just not, you know, like those is, you know, like now I'm full-time here. I'm getting a steady paycheck and we're good to go, unfortunately. Right. It just doesn't that's not been in this town for a long time. And then even piecing together the freelance stuff is been tougher than usual for all of the aforementioned reasons. But going out there and meeting people in person, like that's 100 100% better here. Like why would if I had to like prescribe a schedule for somebody? I mean, I would be thinking about three days a week just doing that, right? as like just I'm going places, you know, as opposed to sending out a ton of applications because like the application process just seems I mean it's borderline on totally broken at this point. Like I don't understand what's happening, right? The the I can't imagine on the other end because it's got to look totally terrible for people hiring as well. I mean like the I guess this whatever they have filtering all of the applications is 40 candidates but you know I can't imagine these are great candidates you know it's just someone who's once again game the system to the maximum degree so you know building all of these gameable systems it's like not not great all right so on that Then",

Yeah. because like you like I have a small business in terms of like you know like my art stuff like it's like techn like an actual legal small business and everything and so like the but I you know it's not it's just an NT under which I do that work but the degree which has become a target for scamming and spamming like over the last year has gotten crazy like um I've gotten a couple of like really, you know, like notice it. It was all laughable before Nigerian princesses and, you know, whatever. But now, like people are clearly pointing the LLMs at like uh a much more sophisticated fishing schemes and stuff like that. Um, and you know, I only see part of that because mine, you know, like it's it's not that publicly visible. like Jen's small business is just delused with that stuff in terms of like fake and the other part of it is like I don't really see most of them are not like so send me your credit card number you know like that like it it seems like either they're playing some like much longer con that I like just don't understand or I I don't even understand what the purpose of the scamming was here like what what are you even getting out of this besides wasting my time. Um but um yeah definitely I mean step one creative circle for sure right because you're finishing and finishing you're not transferring right you're transferring >> don't know yet okay are you transferring >> okay N >> probably not >> probably notation So yeah, I mean the creative identity in in yeah it's particularly dry time but knowing especially a lot of students who have been successful coming out of here the first chunk of time is about piecing together a couple different things, right? There's just not, you know, like those is, you know, like now I'm full-time here. I'm getting a steady paycheck and we're good to go, unfortunately. Right. It just doesn't that's not been in this town for a long time. And then even piecing together the freelance stuff is been tougher than usual for all of the aforementioned reasons. But going out there and meeting people in person, like that's 100 100% better here. Like why would if I had to like prescribe a schedule for somebody? I mean, I would be thinking about three days a week just doing that, right? as like just I'm going places, you know, as opposed to sending out a ton of applications because like the application process just seems I mean it's borderline on totally broken at this point. Like I don't understand what's happening, right? The the I can't imagine on the other end because it's got to look totally terrible for people hiring as well. I mean like the I guess this whatever they have filtering all of the applications is 40 candidates but you know I can't imagine these are great candidates you know it's just someone who's once again game the system to the maximum degree so you know building all of these gameable systems it's like not not great all right so on that Then"

Wow, that's epic. >> Let me show you the UV maps. See UV maps and then substance painter. This is how it looks like. >> Yeah. So your UV map is definitely like kind of the cubic projection thing, but you know, you compensate here by making sure that this isn't triplaner projection. And for this kind of like noisy texture, that's going to look like rendering it on cycles. I looks nice. Yeah, especially with the glass in the scene now, you know, like the difference everyone understands why now, right? The the cycles um physical simulation of the light really matters for the reflective stuff, right? We can get close in EV, but it's not going to be 100% there. Yeah, this is all looking really great. I like the Yeah. Okay. You got some stains on these napkins. Look good. Um, the thing is now I did look at this the other day. I'm like because we're using decals in Unity, but there's not a builtin simple decal solution here, right? Because putting some stains based on what what happened here, some stains on the table would sort of bring the scene together. But there's no direct out of the box uh solution for that. The only thing that really doesn't working for me right now is like the wood texture on these vines. The vi the you know like they don't look like branches. They look very viny. And so I think you may be able to sell that look if this was more green, right? This is like more like live plant and less, you know, dead branch harvested because you ended up using a very curvy path here and that doesn't seem very much like a branch. And that might help that might, you know, be the easier way to make that look correct. >> Yeah. And you clearly you've got a computer with some heft to it. feel like it's you're able to use the cycles render here pretty pretty well. >> Yeah. The so far for this week. >> Yep. Yeah. This um Yeah.

That works great because I, if I remember correctly, you created the high poly versions just by subdividing. And so going in and unsubdividing is a perfect way to make a uh low poly version.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 26, 2025 Student Feedback: Napkin Folding Techniques Hi, it's Crimson and this is my napkin, my base, and my finished table setup. Now, for the napkin here, here's what we got. Um, here's it with color. So, I had it nice and like kind of folded like this just cuz like it's a little weird, but I like folding napkins in like a weird triangle-ish shape. And when it fell like this, I thought it looked nice. So, I decided to go with this shape. Um, I wish it was less bunched up here, but when I was like changing stuff around, like I never really got it to look less bunched up, but I think it looks fine overall. And so, I just had it folded over like that and it could flop down like that. Now for the vase, we got it over here. And these were the reference images I used. Um, I did like a mix between like this little round one and this longer one. Mainly because when I was trying to do the round one, I couldn't get it as like spherical as it is here. But I did that. So >> starting with a sphere I think would get you, you know, seeing this the UV sphere has topology that's lined up like this and it could be then extruded up to make the next part. So yeah, starting not everything has to start with a cube, right? Most of the time with round things, it makes sense to start with, you know, a cylinder or or a sphere >> one. Mainly because when I was trying to do the round one, I couldn't get it as like spherical as it is here. >> There's there's also the sphere. Actually, I don't think it's called that. It's called sphere spherize or I forget what it's called. Right. Right. So if you have a uh cube and subdivide a bunch, right? So who who else ran into this? Um Isabella a little bit. All right. So subdividing the cube, we've been over this before. It makes turns the cube into a ball, but upon closer inspection, it's actually not a ball. It's still pretty squareish. I mean it's more square than a sphere. Um and so the uh right click uh convert to mesh then apply the No, I'm just hallucinating. There used to be there was one in Cinema 4D called sphere sphere spherify completely unpronouncable name. Um, but the shrink wrap does the same job for any shape. And so now if you make a sphere, an actual sphere, and then you take the cube that's not quite a sphere, and tell it to shrink wrap to the sphere, now it is perfectly spherical, right? And so there it is. Uh without w with without without right. So you can see how not spherical it was. And now we can see right. So if you need to make anything rounder, the shrink wrap here is your friend. Right? Essentially projecting some vertices onto some other 3D. But I did that. And we got the little plant bits with small little leaves. And then we have the final table render in general here once the render view loads in. And there we go. And you can't really see the different napkin textures that well. This one just has like a few little spots of like red wine. And this one's got a lot of spots on the corner there. And I made it like darker. It was like dabbed around. Um except the more I look at it, the more I'm like, \"Oh, this straight up just kind of looks like blood.\" They got blood everywhere. Um which isn't very good. But if we go here, and this is the view I did, um showing off the napkins because you can't really see it there. the focus is on the base. But yeah, overall I I really like the way the table setup ended up and I don't think it looks that bad. Thank you. >> Okay, so make some time next week to look at the stuff we did with the EV glass. Yours is still like pretty thick. Um and it looks really thick. I think you're still probably using the sphere um refraction model and maybe don't have the we use the alpha to dial in some more of the see-throughness there. And then yeah, I'd love to see you give I thought the texture on your reference vase was very cool and that looked like a something that it looked to me like a bunch of masks on some Substance Painter fill layers. try see see if you can take take a shot at trying to reproduce that. Um yeah, this looks like a like a doable task. This mask maybe it's a mask that you paint yourself and then remember in Substance Painter the distort effect is called um warp. Uh, and so warping the mask a little bit more could probably give you some of this edge. Right. This is a little bit height. More height over this one here. Looks doable. Give that a shot.",

It's called sphere spherize or I forget what it's called. Right. Right. So if you have a uh cube and subdivide a bunch, right? So who who else ran into this? Um Isabella a little bit. All right. So subdividing the cube, we've been over this before. It makes turns the cube into a ball, but upon closer inspection, it's actually not a ball. It's still pretty squareish. I mean it's more square than a sphere. Um and so the uh right click uh convert to mesh then apply the No, I'm just hallucinating. There used to be there was one in Cinema 4D called sphere sphere spherify completely unpronouncable name. Um, but the shrink wrap does the same job for any shape. And so now if you make a sphere, an actual sphere, and then you take the cube that's not quite a sphere, and tell it to shrink wrap to the sphere, now it is perfectly spherical, right? And so there it is. Uh without w with without without right. So you can see how not spherical it was. And now we can see right. So if you need to make anything rounder, the shrink wrap here is your friend. Right? Essentially projecting some vertices onto some other 3D. But I did that. And we got the little plant bits with small little leaves. And then we have the final table render in general here once the render view loads in. And there we go. And you can't really see the different napkin textures that well. This one just has like a few little spots of like red wine. And this one's got a lot of spots on the corner there. And I made it like darker. It was like dabbed around. Um except the more I look at it, the more I'm like, \"Oh, this straight up just kind of looks like blood.\" They got blood everywhere. Um which isn't very good. But if we go here, and this is the view I did, um showing off the napkins because you can't really see it there. the focus is on the base. But yeah, overall I I really like the way the table setup ended up and I don't think it looks that bad. Thank you. >> Okay, so make some time next week to look at the stuff we did with the EV glass. Yours is still like pretty thick. Um and it looks really thick. I think you're still probably using the sphere um refraction model and maybe don't have the we use the alpha to dial in some more of the see-throughness there. And then yeah, I'd love to see you give I thought the texture on your reference vase was very cool and that looked like a something that it looked to me like a bunch of masks on some Substance Painter fill layers. try see see if you can take take a shot at trying to reproduce that. Um yeah, this looks like a like a doable task. This mask maybe it's a mask that you paint yourself and then remember in Substance Painter the distort effect is called um warp. Uh, and so warping the mask a little bit more could probably give you some of this edge. Right. This is a little bit height. More height over this one here. Looks doable. Give that a shot."

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 26, 2025 Student Feedback: Pottery and Texturing On your way. Here's B. Hey, good morning everybody. It's Bo here. So, this is my napkin setup. I pretty much just followed along with what Casey did in class as far as like setting up all the parameters. I think mine is a a 14inch uh napkin. It's not too big, but kind of like in the middle. Um, so these are what I decided to use as my meshes. That same thing happened here. Casey is like what happened in the class. So if I click on that and press play. Yep, that's pretty much what it does is it's nice and easy. I think it falls pretty well. pretty good subdivision on it, too, so it doesn't like lay and kill itself. Um, but yeah, that's that was my napkin. And then here is my vase. Here's my reference. So, I was kind of going with this rounded one, but what I did instead of, you know, just keeping it kind of simple is I made a little lip on the top. So, and I made a low poly version as you can see here. And then I made a high poly version as you can see here without being gunshy. You know, there's some super dense. Um, but yeah, I wanted to sculpt it out. I thought I really liked how we did the plates. So, that was I like that. And I also gave it an inside so it's not one solid, you know, clay pot. It's actually like a pottery pot. So, we threw down right here. As Casey would say on this pottery show, we threw down. So, it has an inside. >> Yeah. I mean, have you guys watched the show? Have you Jack? I don't know why I'm asking. Have you Have you watched The Great British Throwdown or >> Yeah, like I said, it's not um the work they're doing is really interesting. The show itself is maybe not thrill. And then from a UV layout, um, just split down the center on both sides. And then, yeah, split the inside with the outside, top and bottom. And I think it laid out very well. And speaking of that, here's my Substance Painter. So, I just kept it simple. I didn't go too crazy with it because I actually like how it turned out, like the glossiness of the ceramics. And then these were alphas that I drove from the fill layer kind of getting all the colors because the same as the base so it all pretty much matched. Um these florals up top I used the the pin tool and then integrated in that design to go all the way around as nice and as tight as I possibly could get it. But yeah, I think it turned out very cool. The inside looks pretty cool also. >> Like an entire like painted inside and out. Um, >> I mean, my only thing here is like perhap perhaps the main like I think these would get a lot more visual interest if this were just like a more neutral color like the like more of a gray or something like that because it's just like it's like very >> but yeah, I like the way that this came out and just like I said kept it simple, you know, not too much crazy. Just use a pearl and noise and then a gradient on that. And then as Bo de demonstrates here really well, like you know what you should be noticing some overlap between like painting the height channel in Substance Painter or sculpting high poly detail and then baking it down, right? Like there in a lot of instances very similar results, right? And so which one do you feel more comfortable with? You know what uh you know which which tool did you click with better? You know, in there there would be some differences, but in a lot of examples, this one in particular, this this could have been painted on the high channel or it could be something that you're um sculpting and then bringing bringing in that way. So, >> and then filled in the rest. And then here is my final ring. Yeah, I kind of expect I mean and you can you can export a displaced mesh from Substance Painter. So you can actually use the height deformation stuff like sculpting tools in um Blender. So there's that. I I I feel like Substance Painter is going in that direction. Like having more tools that are sort of like explicitly designed as sculpt tools in Substance Painter is probably coming soon kind of. Well, I mean then we're kind of got this overlap between Substance Modeler and Substance Painter, right? And Substance Modeler again similar kind of thing, right? That last step of exporting and substance modeler is very similar to like the baking of the maps from scene with the napkins. There's one on the chair over here. Then there's one on the table. Put a spoon on top of it. Kind of like placed. Nope, not that. There's another one there. And then there's a used one. did a little bit of a a dirty dirtiness with some red wine. And you can see it kind of like fades out with some of the spotes like as it was drying. And yeah, there's the pot. And this is the one thing that I wish I would have known before I finalized it because I'm not sure about going back and changing how everything would be in the the final and putting it back into Substance Painter was the leaves because they do look very tiny. Very very tiny. Um that that's probably one thing I don't like about this whole setup, my setup here, is the way that those leaves look because when you get farther away, you can barely see them. So like when you come into the scene, you can barely barely see them. You know, it's it's not it's not good. But yeah, I'm out of town for the next week, so I had to kind of did a rush job this weekend to get this done. But there's my table scene. >> Yeah, that looks really good. I'm trying to think if there's a way once we've baked them into an object to easily access all the leaves. I thought control L was just things that are actually connected like not just but I'm not I'm not sure. So if we were to do this. And where's the check box for the up here? gets real. Then control J or convert to mesh there. Convert to mesh. Crl J and then tab and select one of these and control L. Yeah. Yeah, I think it needs to be actually. Is there a way to make a UV selection that would also be if I selected over here in the UV? Can I go the other way with that? >> Yeah. And so if I were to come over here actually what if you it's together. Yeah, because we did turn it into one UV space, right? But did we make it two separate objects? >> But were there two objects or one object? Should we make it one object over here? Did I join them when I did? >> I mean you could um to reverse engineer this controll and separate this. Now we just have these which would be just your leaves. And so now uh if you selected all of them tabbed in and you wanted to scale because we did take the time to make sure that they pointed in the right direction otherwise they wouldn't have looked right with using the particle system. We should be able to scale them individually or sort of individually from their own axis by wrangling some of your things here. So individual origins is that it now if we scale yeah now they scale up from their each individual place and so that should keep them where or no yeah that'll work because I I specifically remember moving the anchor point of the plane down to the bottom and it'll scale up from that anchor I heard that. Yeah, I'm not so sure. You you you should be able to scale them some, but like does it the individual faces don't have anchor points? they were irrespected the thing when we had them before. So actually I mean that's part of it but then Yeah, the faces don't anchor point. I mean, that's part of it. I mean, now they're separate. So, I mean, you can scale them certainly individually to make some bigger leaves. Um, or you could just take your painted leaf and put it on a new particle system and populate the branches. That would also work as a workaround there, B. Either one of either one of those. Yeah, your glass is looking better. Yeah, everybody's EV glass seems much more dialed in here. Cool.

    "search_text": "AVC185 November 26, 2025 Student Feedback: Wine Glass Improvements that in a minute. Hey, this is Jack with ABC 185 and we're take a look at the uh table scene. changed the glass around, make it actually more visible. I really like how this turned out actually. Um, and you can see that double wall a little bit. Um, and also lowered the normal map here on the table to make it less um, aggressive. And I think that does that did help a lot. Um, also added the wine stuff. I had I have different levels of wine uh, cuz I thought that'd be interesting. Um, yeah, I've got a little storytelling here with uh the soaked napkin next to the knocked over wine glass. And here's like a dirty the dirty napkin. Anyways, yeah, these are the napkins. I really had a lot of trouble getting them to um fall, right? That's I mean that's why you see I only have like two that are actually crumble and like the other two are just like kind of there as place mats because that uh worked way better. also added a solidify after the fact because I thought it just gave it some extra extra volume, but I modeled it as like a plane and everything. Um, the settings I used, I was originally just using the bass settings and then I changed to silk uh preset, I think, and that gave me a lot like that. I used this I use the silk preset on this and this this looked way this looked way better than this one, which used the uh like the default one. I also just did some more stuff for this to make it look better, but yeah, this one doesn't look great. Yeah. And so here's the vase and leaves. This was a lot of fun. Uh it took a lot of effort, but uh yeah, it turned out really nice. So yeah, the vase is right here. Here's the UV map. Yeah. So, I did a cut just along this um which gave it a seam on the inside which you know I don't know it doesn't look great but um I think it makes sense kind of though cuz like feel like things like this would be maybe made in two pieces and like combined together. I'm not sure but anyways. And then yeah, I just cut out the uh the bottom there. And here's the reference I base it off of. Um and I kind of based the leaves off of this as well. It's like an olive branch. Um, but I I kind of put my own my own little flavor on it. But, um, yeah. And this just happened to have dimensions. Like I I was not, >> oh, really? >> I'm glad it did happen to have these, but like I saw this image and was like, \"Yes, I want to make that.\" And then I moved to the next image. I was like, \"Oh, well, that's helpful.\" So, yeah, it is two two scale of uh of this. Although, they have it as more of like an oval shape, and I think it just made more sense for me to have as like a circle shape. So, it's not exactly one one. Um, but yeah, and this was a lot of fun making the handle. This was that worked out really nice. >> So, how did you do that? >> Um, I I dissolve like I grab a few, dissolve the edges, and then a little bit >> them. >> Cool. I don't know if that's >> I mean it looked like >> you know >> Yeah. And then the >> No. Yeah. in all instances like I don't think you could end up as long as you got a square area then you would end up with quads going around. So yeah, even if it was an odd number of them it would still be quads going around. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, as long as you had the same number going around, then it would bridge no problem. And you have all quads. So, yeah, I mean, you can see you have your, you know, poles, you know, where you would expect them to be in those instances. Yeah, that's uh for any sort of handle thing that's giving you the cleanest possible topology. It's really good. Um, yeah, and then here's the wireframe and stuff. Uh anyways, yeah, and the leaves I did make these a little higher poly um but it gave them like this nice curve which I thought added a lot of character to it. I kind of modeled it to look like a leaf before even like doing the alpha stuff. So, you know, probably not the smartest, but like you know, >> yeah, I mean in all but the most stingy stingiest of polygon environments, >> we're just trying to make a nice looking scene here. So, so yeah, this is my scene. Um, we got a few renders here >> and yeah, like the again my I've been doing this for a while and so like the polygon thing was definitely more of a bigger deal, but now we got things like Unreal Engine Nanite and things like this that are happening where it's just sort of like, you know, one of the takes is like, well, now everything can just be photo scans. We just dump it all in there and let let the program dynamically lo everything every frame. This is like maybe I guess like but it it seem it seems like still being relatively efficient. I mean the computer can do so much work that amount of work always increases but if your work is more efficient you could do more on that hard cap of computation. Some of them I didn't finish the napkins when I was taking these but uh yeah I think they look quite nice. And especially at the number of leaves that we have here, like how is there like a hundred, you know, like on a if it was like a full-blown olive tree where you're talking about like 35 thousands of of leaves, right? Then it's sort of a different story. >> Yep. Um and then we'll take a look at the vase and substance painter as well. We I added like those uh black specks on top similar to what we did with the ceramic where I have it digging in which I think really adds a lot of uh flavor to it. Um I added like a general like just rough or like kind of what we did with the glass where there's just like bumps like big wide bumps cuz I was like oh this is you know handmade. Um some more just like bumps across the surface the uh that color which is like a gradient and bunch of stuff. And then I use this noise as like an anchor as well. Um, so yeah, it was pretty simple. So yeah, I believe that's everything. Uh, thank you and goodbye. Hey, this is",
    "transcript_segment": "that in a minute. Hey, this is Jack with ABC 185 and we're take a look at the uh table scene. changed the glass around, make it actually more visible. I really like how this turned out actually. Um, and you can see that double wall a little bit. Um, and also lowered the normal map here on the table to make it less um, aggressive. And I think that does that did help a lot. Um, also added the wine stuff. I had I have different levels of wine uh, cuz I thought that'd be interesting. Um, yeah, I've got a little storytelling here with uh the soaked napkin next to the knocked over wine glass. And here's like a dirty the dirty napkin. Anyways, yeah, these are the napkins. I really had a lot of trouble getting them to um fall, right? That's I mean that's why you see I only have like two that are actually crumble and like the other two are just like kind of there as place mats because that uh worked way better. also added a solidify after the fact because I thought it just gave it some extra extra volume, but I modeled it as like a plane and everything. Um, the settings I used, I was originally just using the bass settings and then I changed to silk uh preset, I think, and that gave me a lot like that. I used this I use the silk preset on this and this this looked way this looked way better than this one, which used the uh like the default one. I also just did some more stuff for this to make it look better, but yeah, this one doesn't look great. Yeah. And so here's the vase and leaves. This was a lot of fun. Uh it took a lot of effort, but uh yeah, it turned out really nice. So yeah, the vase is right here. Here's the UV map. Yeah. So, I did a cut just along this um which gave it a seam on the inside which you know I don't know it doesn't look great but um I think it makes sense kind of though cuz like feel like things like this would be maybe made in two pieces and like combined together. I'm not sure but anyways. And then yeah, I just cut out the uh the bottom there. And here's the reference I base it off of. Um and I kind of based the leaves off of this as well. It's like an olive branch. Um, but I I kind of put my own my own little flavor on it. But, um, yeah. And this just happened to have dimensions. Like I I was not, >> oh, really? >> I'm glad it did happen to have these, but like I saw this image and was like, \"Yes, I want to make that.\" And then I moved to the next image. I was like, \"Oh, well, that's helpful.\" So, yeah, it is two two scale of uh of this. Although, they have it as more of like an oval shape, and I think it just made more sense for me to have as like a circle shape. So, it's not exactly one one. Um, but yeah, and this was a lot of fun making the handle. This was that worked out really nice. >> So, how did you do that? >> Um, I I dissolve like I grab a few, dissolve the edges, and then a little bit >> them. >> Cool.

And so instead of just jamming the subdivide button, I'm going to use the remsh function. And so R, you know, brings up our grid. And you know, if you make this too tight to where it's like so small, you'll be taxing the machine. Actually, before we do this, uh, well, no, I'll just leave it where it is. Um, right about there. Right. So, remember R brings up this grid. So, you can dial in the level of subdivision and then controlR actually does it, right? it actually does the remsh at that level. And so now you see that the top part of it is equally subdivided as the rest of it. If I were just to just hitting subdivide, it would have taken forever for this top to get reasonably subdivided, but then the sides would have gotten super super dense. Um, yep. And so let's come sure in there. What is this? Like it drips in some sort of pattern. Let's just try and get some reference here. All right. So, you know, building up these blobby parts coming down here. That's got to melt around at the top. Maybe we, you know, you can make a a wick kind of later. So, if I make this bigger and just sort of shift to smooth some things out. Um, and then maybe grab the grab tool here and just, you know, make things a little bit less regular. And then our draw tool is going to help to do F. Bring this in F. There we go. And so here we can start to put in dripping of the wax. You can see it sort of builds up. Now we can get to So that's the other I'm trying to remember where the setting is. The default is that the brush stays the same size. So that as you zoom in and out like the effect of the brush would be different. But yeah, radius units scene now if I paint or yeah the brush is getting bigger when I zoom in. So now in this case probably that's better in terms of and yeah the candle's shape can be kind of forgiving here and that we kind of want it to look blobby to begin with. And we can uh the other thing you could play with on the brush here, radius, texture, stroke, right? So, spacing. Uh if we turn that up a little bit, right? But I thought we could randomize that. Uh, under stroke spacing, that's up. Dash ratio, we turn that down. Then jitter up a bit. There we go. Now it's randomizing it. Yeah. And so, actually, if we turn this back down, now it's making it Then when you want to have some more detail, again, I like that crease sharp brush. Um, maybe back off the strength a little bit, but it can, you know, give you some more distinct edges perhaps to some of the parts of the wax. You get the idea, right? It's pretty loose here. Let's see if we can build up some stuff on the bottom. So this might be something where we do some remeshing. So if we sort of smooth some of this out, we want some buildup wax here. This is where the snake hook, which is this one, might come in handy. Right. So you can sort of bring this out. Now when you start to push this further um you'll notice that you are actually you know stretching the existing geometry and so a second controlr will remesh pulled out right so when you change the silhouette significantly doing that is super important uh so that we end up with some reasonable geometry here if we come back. And so now, and let's add some dribbling that goes all the way down. Back to the draw. Does the draw keep the same? Yeah. Okay. Kept the same stuff there. And so now if I were to bring this in We're now back to a solid one here. That's down. Okay, you get the idea. Let's um in terms of the Hold on one sec.

And then in here can look at some of the subsurface scattering stuff. I'm also just going to get some sort of uh interior reflections going. Okay. And I don't necessarily need to see that right now. There. Uh, great. And so now on this material, let's turn that off and back in here and over here and here candle. And let's look into our shader view. So here is where uh we can do some work now under the subsurface scattering um settings. And so the weight here you can see sort of doing the initial thing right essentially the dark side of the object gets much more um the light passes through and lights that up. So this sort of like very matte looking uh finish and yeah depending on what kind of quality we want for this. If we turn the IR back down, right about there. Yeah, our roughness. Trying to find some value that works here. Uh probably some noise. Um shift a normal. Not that one. the want some smaller noisy detail right about there. And then you can shift drag, you know, just a touch of this sort of give you some action there. Maybe this could get ramped into the roughness to give it some more deal there. But the the weight of the subsurface scattering, this starts to help what's going on. And then this is going to be some fun figuring out the interaction between the base color and then the um radius here is going to be like how much red, green, and blue are we absorbing? And so you can bust this out into a color. Although I think we're going to have the same sort of situation here where actually let me put this back at white. And now uh here the scale is like how deep into the thing is the are the light rays penetrating. And then over here this is let's see is this correct? Yeah. Okay. So you can just hook the RGB up to here. This is when was it doing this? Oh, for the volume previously in the other class, right? Um I'm still not even 100% sure how that worked. But the yeah, if we go blue, it looks blue, which is intuitively what you want. Although, um in reality, sometimes it's the opposite, right? where if it's if it's absorbing the blue and you're setting and the value is labeled as absorption, then it actually looks more red. But you don't have to worry about it. This is what you would intuitively want to have happen here.

You know, not doing something super saturated, but you know, you can get some, you know, play between those two values perhaps depending on What that looks like. The subserver scattering does kind of blow out some of the detailing from the sculpting. The way it kind of um you know equalizes the way the light passes through the object. You can see the shadowing kind of gets less in there. But we could adjust some of that with the maybe mixing in more of the ambient occlusion and the comp or something like that. But yeah, you can have some fun with this. Um yeah, let's just leave it as the high poly for now.

I didn't test it on sprites and so yeah, it doesn't work on sprites and probably needs to be a separate thing. So, I would just make yours planes and use the render on top on the plane. And uh because they're just uh sitting in the environment, if you walk up to it, uh you standing there interferes with your ability to select it. But I have everything working. Um, I've made >> really nice uh platform animation there. Right, Zoe avoided the typical student pitfall of having platforms go at, you know, really, really not so great speeds. So, that looks like something you can actually walk onto, which is great. >> Some decals, uh, you can see them all down here. Um, mostly they're uh designed uh to show just like where in the environment and then oh I always forget that it's E. Um, and then um >> yeah, that's cool. We got the whole dialogue sequence. I mean there with those I mean they the rest of the game is so visually refined I imagine these are kind of placeholdery but like again you can scale these and so you know you drew them with that intention it appears and so that one of two things needs to happen. one, you need to make some sort of frame so that this is positioned there at the bottom of the frame or just scale this up so that this flat edge is, you know, at the bottom of the screen there, which I think might be the better way to go here again in in the script, just to make this clear again, uh, Uh empty dialogue. If we make some dialogue here, here unfold. I wish they automatically unfold, but they don't. Um and then give it an image. Then you can come down here and show canvas preview. Again, make sure you're at 16 by9. Make sure you're zoomed out. And then turn that on. There we go. And so now you can um change the left image position to wherever it needs to be and the scaling. It' be better if these were linked as the start so that they wouldn't be it wouldn't be so easy to smush it. But um so yeah, keep these numbers the same circumstances. And then uh yeah, and then if I had the next line of dialogue, I just slide this over. Then I can just that one. And then the way I did it with the decision, right, the decision can only happen at the end of a dialogue sequence. and you say yes to uh I want a decision. And so then you have to have just like the dialogue system, you add your decisions here. These are your choices between the different things. Um and we'll say this is choice one and uh over here this is choice two. And um now the decision will appear as the last you slide it over to the right. And so it's not a separate it's on the same canvas. It's part of the same system. It just always comes last. And so it's always there. And so if you want to have multiple decisions in a conversation, you have to link multiple objects. So given the scale of our conversations that seem to make sense, right? And so then you can choose and every time you add a decision, you can have more than one if you want to have a third option here. And then the and then these here are the events for these decisions, right? And so if choice one is incorrect, you you would link it to something else that says nah or you know try again or come back later when you have the thing. And then you know if this was the one if this is the choice that's you know like well thank you I do look nice today. I'll open the door for you. Then this is the event that opens the door after that. Um so on and so forth. So you don't have to have a decision at the end of a dialogue sequence but now you can. And then each of those is configurable however you would want there. But then the key thing to remember here is that they're all at the end. The decisions are all at the end of this. And then yeah, I'm really proud of this thing here that allows us to use all this stuff. And remember there is a background for the entire thing built into where we put the background image. Uh yeah, right here. So background image, you can have a background image for the whole thing, the whole sequence right there, which is great. Okay, so yeah, you've got that happening. Awesome. And then um yeah, that's not how the exchange is going to go when I have the dialogue finished, but uh yeah, proof of concept. And there you can fally the core functionality of the game is there and you can die. Oh, and I have checkpoints ready. You can fall. You can die from falling now. That's is so much fun. Yeah, this is the decal in the environment. And I have more decal material. Yeah, I have the decal materials ready. I believe I made yeah decal prefabs for each type that I'll be placing around.

Um, mostly they're uh designed uh to show just like where in the environment and then oh I always forget that it's E. Um, and then um >> yeah, that's cool. We got the whole dialogue sequence. I mean there with those I mean they the rest of the game is so visually refined I imagine these are kind of placeholdery but like again you can scale these and so you know you drew them with that intention it appears and so that one of two things needs to happen. one, you need to make some sort of frame so that this is positioned there at the bottom of the frame or just scale this up so that this flat edge is, you know, at the bottom of the screen there, which I think might be the better way to go here again in in the script, just to make this clear again, uh, Uh empty dialogue. If we make some dialogue here, here unfold. I wish they automatically unfold, but they don't. Um and then give it an image. Then you can come down here and show canvas preview. Again, make sure you're at 16 by9. Make sure you're zoomed out. And then turn that on. There we go. And so now you can um change the left image position to wherever it needs to be and the scaling. It' be better if these were linked as the start so that they wouldn't be it wouldn't be so easy to smush it. But um so yeah, keep these numbers the same circumstances. And then uh yeah, and then if I had the next line of dialogue, I just slide this over. Then I can just that one. And then the way I did it with the decision, right, the decision can only happen at the end of a dialogue sequence. and you say yes to uh I want a decision. And so then you have to have just like the dialogue system, you add your decisions here. These are your choices between the different things. Um and we'll say this is choice one and uh over here this is choice two. And um now the decision will appear as the last you slide it over to the right. And so it's not a separate it's on the same canvas. It's part of the same system. It just always comes last. And so it's always there. And so if you want to have multiple decisions in a conversation, you have to link multiple objects. So given the scale of our conversations that seem to make sense, right? And so then you can choose and every time you add a decision, you can have more than one if you want to have a third option here. And then the and then these here are the events for these decisions, right? And so if choice one is incorrect, you you would link it to something else that says nah or you know try again or come back later when you have the thing. And then you know if this was the one if this is the choice that's you know like well thank you I do look nice today. I'll open the door for you. Then this is the event that opens the door after that. Um so on and so forth. So you don't have to have a decision at the end of a dialogue sequence but now you can. And then each of those is configurable however you would want there. But then the key thing to remember here is that they're all at the end. The decisions are all at the end of this. And then yeah, I'm really proud of this thing here that allows us to use all this stuff. And remember there is a background for the entire thing built into where we put the background image. Uh yeah, right here. So background image, you can have a background image for the whole thing, the whole sequence right there, which is great. Okay, so yeah, you've got that happening. Awesome. And then um yeah, that's not how the exchange is going to go when I have the dialogue finished, but uh yeah, proof of concept. And there you can fally the core functionality of the game is there and you can die. Oh, and I have checkpoints ready. You can fall. You can die from falling now. That's is so much fun. Yeah, this is the decal in the environment. And I have more decal material. Yeah, I have the decal materials ready. I believe I made yeah decal prefabs for each type that I'll be placing around. The pedestal prefab is updated. I am still having problems with the sprint."

Uh, so far I was able to get the SP spike and then the thing added health thing and I think changing the health the health thing the cherry to a healthy item than a speed item because it make more sense, you know. But one I had trouble is the rock. It had you know I got a little bit frustrated and trying to get this to work. The rock work but it was keep of it the same appearing. I try to print a different texture and then watch to get to work but yeah I just wouldn't work the walk animation. Oh, you were saying something about a texture, I believe, which leads me to believe you're talking about the decal. I mean, the walk, you have your walk animation playing, which is good. Let me see. >> Keep the same appearing. I try put texture and then try to get to work, but yeah. and I just wouldn't work. But >> yeah, the the decal remember there's that first step you have to enable the decal in the render pipeline and there is room for error there, right? So what was the thing we did? What was the easiest way to get to the correct render pipeline? We went to the >> Yeah. Yeah, everybody should be set up. Yeah, all all of our projects should be set up the same in this way. So the PC see this is the yeah all of these render configuration files it just it does get quite confusing because yeah these are not the same and so yeah PC render renderer. That's where if you don't have this enabled on the PC renderer, you're not going to see I I don't even think we'll let you make a decal object unless that's on, although I'm not 100% sure. But yeah, uh both of these are responsible for configuring some aspects of the actual render pipeline. The good news is that the scriptable render pipeline is very scriptable. The bad news is that the scriptable render pipeline is super scriptable. Uh so there's like, you know, a ton of settings here. And the the other issue here is that yeah, we have it set to PC. When we build it, it should be the PC one, but you can have separate render settings depending on whether it was built for mobile or PC or something, right? So again like uh running up against you know increased capability always results in increased complexity you know so if you're just trying to do one thing uh sometimes the tool gets unwieldy and this is certainly one of those instances but okay um I mean I think that's what you're saying there. I'm not 100% sure. I am what else other than that I've been working on organize the world and stuff. I haven't fully aditted, you know, the diamond taken yet with the spike. I'm working on it, but I got a little too much space here fixing this rock and hear everything yet, but I'm working on it. So, other than that, all I have this week. >> Okay. Yeah. I mean, I would We have a bunch of functionality. Putting in the health stuff would be good, but at this point, I would try to shift gears mentally to start making this world feel like like a place. Right now it still feels like a demo template, right? Like um what what can we do to start populating the world to make it feel like like a location because it the character seems like this this is kind of arbitrary character in an arbitrary demo location. So that that would be my next step. And then while you're doing that, make sure you take some steps to organize while you're doing that. So that you know, and this goes to for everybody. I'm not just picking on Desmond here. I'm sure there's others in class whose you know, hierarchy here is just a you know, hundreds long list of things. And you want to be organizing those under parent objects. not a ton of parent objects because that does um it could step the make the whole process a little bit slower when it computes if that if there's a whole bunch of unnecessary hierarchy but like one or two things for organization is fine. Um and then yeah m making it feel like somewhere right. So remember it was um mechanics and dynamics and aesthetics and so you have some mechanics happening but there's no it's not making me it's not giving me any sort of feeling at this point whether that feel whether that feeling is scared or happy or confused or whatever. It's just kind of blank. So, think think about that. Um, I would say that there's no Yeah, like this doesn't feel like a real world place, but uh there's actually that new art installation in Las Vegas that feels a lot like the Unreal Engine default level. Um, okay. So, I mean, I'm not throwing a bunch of shade at Michael Heiser, the artist here, who's like an historically important um land artist. But, um, what is it? Trying to remember what this thing is called. Oh, yeah. It's called City. He's been working on it for um I don't know, decades. Uh, this is outside. This is somewhere in Nevada. I like it. Like, you know, there's almost no one in Nevada besides Las Vegas, right? So, like everything in Nevada is kind of like, yeah, it's outside of Las Vegas, but you know, like it's just as big as Arizona. Um but yeah, like th this is he, you know, it's this giant concrete brutalist minimalist, you know, art installation. Um the size of a of a city. But you know, and it's not just me. Like I when I showed some other people who are familiar with like game development and stuff this art piece, they're like, \"Oh yeah, this looks like the, you know, like when you load up Unreal Engine for the first time, there's like a default level with some like triangular shapes and stuff in it, and it looks like disturbingly similar to this, right?\" Now, Michael Heiser predates Unreal Engine by quite a ways. So, there's the chicken and the egg uh question here. Like, did they just make Unreal Engine default look like Michael Heiser's um kind of esoteric Nevada based art installation? I don't know. But now we're in a world where we have this, you know, uncomfortable uh comparison between the two. Yeah. The scale of it is like crazy. It's massive. Um, I don't know if it's open to the public yet, and then, you know, I'm not a skateboarder, but it seems like like it would be I mean, this has to happened already, right? Like somebody trying to breaking in to do that because it just seems like the the social media video of you doing such would be a roaring success. Um, yeah.

And then a little like dial thing as well. And yeah, so I just put those all over the consoles, and they look pretty cool. All right. So, here's like a bunch of stuff put together. Um, so yeah, I did the uh I changed the floor. I had some walls and stuff. And yeah, so here's some of the stuff I made. So each of these consoles have different arrangements of buttons on them. And I've got these pipes that I made in Blender. And yeah, alpha clipping. I guess it looks kind of bad still, but I like it. It looks it looks better here. Um I mean it's it's like a a knob, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. I I don't know. Like like like I think it's fine. I I guess I would read it more as knob if it were um not as red. Like I know like there's those red ones, but it ends up just the way it's crunched. It ends up looking like a like a blood splatter or something, you know, and not a knob there.

I mean, yeah, because you're not just lowering the resolution, you're also doing like some contrasty stuff or something. What are you doing? >> Index color. So, it's like the amount of >> Oh, okay. It's like remapping the locking the color to max. >> Okay. >> So, anything that's not in that color like I think I don't know >> and and it comes up with what the colors are or did you assign the colors? >> Um it's based on the colors that exist. >> Okay. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Now, I'm not Someone may have made a Substance Painter effect that does that. So, that would save you a step. It's worth looking. >> Yeah. >> So, uh yeah, I've got like a little switch thing, a little knob, another little uh like switch, a button, uh a little light pad, and these have emission on them as well. And then a little like dial thing as well. And yeah, so I just put those all over the consoles, and they look pretty cool. All right. So, here's like a bunch of stuff put together. Um, so yeah, I did the uh I changed the floor. I had some walls and stuff. And yeah, so here's some of the stuff I made. So each of these consoles have different arrangements of buttons on them. And I've got these pipes that I made in Blender. And yeah, alpha clipping. I guess it looks kind of bad still, but I like it. It looks it looks better here. Um I mean it's it's like a a knob, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. I I don't know. Like like like I think it's fine. I I guess I would read it more as knob if it were um not as red. Like I know like there's those red ones, but it ends up just the way it's crunched. It ends up looking like a like a blood splatter or something, you know, and not a knob there. It seems like even lower res than like the other low res stuff. like solo res that like I'm not sure what it is >> but it's minor minor these are really great super great modular design thing and then yeah you don't need to drive yourself insane there as long I mean I think three is that magic number if you made three different console designs and then prefabbed those right so there is this whole thing I haven't really addressed you can have nested prefabs right where you know it's like a prefab in a prefab and right so you could make a prefab out of like this spatial arrangement of knobs and buttons and then that prefab could be nested in a console prefab right and then so you could match prefabs in like a hierarchical way there so in this case usually that's just like an unnecessary again unnecessary level complexity but in your case it may be advantageous you're I mean imagine there's going to be a lot of these things in the rooms and so that may be may be worth it in that. >> But yeah, these are the pipes al together in various uh formations. Yeah. Um >> this looks really great. The only thing here is Yeah, I think the scale on this is way way too big, right? That's usually these things are like, you know, like half an inch or something usually on the metal grading. That's that's that's too big. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just makes the like that kind of thing when it's that kind of pattern. >> Like if it were just the random green and rust like it would be totally fine. But like everyone that's like such a standard thing that like metal grading pattern and we all know how big that is and how big it is compared to our shoes and everything else like that. So it just throws off the scale. >> So yeah. Yeah. I mean, um,"

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 26, 2025 Reflection Probe Setup Tutorial >> um, and then here's also my decals. I wasn't sure what to do, so I wanted like a puddle, but, uh, yeah, it's not very it's not reflective or anything. So, um, so I think turn turning on the Yeah. And turning up the smoothness and the metallic should give you the inf. Um, okay. So, let's test this here. Uh yeah. So if I make a new decal, well here, let me demonstrate this here because um unlike Blender um the reflections, you need to be more specific about the reflections. So for instance here if I make a new material uh and we'll call this reflective and then put this on our player. There we go. And we make it reflective. So, turn this up. Turn this up. There we go. We get so much with that. Let me turn off this random decal. so much random stuff in my examples. Okay, there we go. Uh you can see we get what do we get? You get um you're like, \"Okay, yeah, that looks more reflective.\" But then upon closer in inspection, it's reflecting the skybox, right? There's the default skybox. In your case, you want to black that out, right? So that uh that's out of there. And um yeah, we're using the uh universal render pipeline which is not going to do reflections out of the box because reflections are super can be very very very computationally expensive because you got to think about what light is bouncing off of other stuff. So you can uh cheat this or make a faster computing version of it with what's called a reflection probe. And so reflection probe is essentially think of them as cameras that are on the area where the probe is and they're filming things around the character. kind of like in triplaner projection, right? Where there's multiple cameras and then they're taking whatever they see and sort of mapping it as a reflection onto the thing. And so you're not calculating reflections for the whole scene. You're just calculating reflections in this one spot. And so this is the uh typical way reflections are done in game certainly in games up until very very recently. Right now like ray traced games are a thing. Uh, but I mean like very recently, like the last few years, and unless you've got either a really powerful PC or like the like this, it was not a thing on PS4 and it is a thing on PS5. That's how recent it is. And so, um, so yeah, in order to reflect more stuff, we need a reflection probe. And so that's going to be necessary for the decal, I believe, if you wanted to actually reflect not just the skybox, but all the stuff around. And so here we put this reflective thing on our OB player. And then I'm going to make a effects or no light uh reflection probe. There we go. It's a separate object. It gets visualized as this ball. Um and this needs to come up under here. And then uh yeah. So for trying to get reflections on things that sit still, you bake them where it just calculates them beforehand and then if something passed in like if you had a mirror that was baked and you had the reflections, it would the nothing that animated would show up in the baked reflection. In this case, because we put it on the player and we want the player to itself to be reflective, we need to go real time, which is obviously more expensive than baked because it recalculates um every frame. And so real time every frame, I think that's enough. Let's see. Is it actually No, let's make it at the same place as the player. So, it's a child. I hit reset and it goes to where the player is. There it is. Uh, the part that always gets a little squirly here is understanding the size of it. And so, yeah, you can barely see. There's the box, right? This box is the reflection probe. So, I believe it's reflecting the things within the box. Let's make it a little bigger. 20 20 There we go. And so now if we come in and we're to look at this um and then there's this update situation. Is it updating now or does it only update when we turn the game on? I believe that's a setting somewhere. Okay. And then real time reflection probes are dis disabled in the quality settings. H that does not take me to the quality settings. They they are fixing a lot of that stuff, but edit project settings quality. Okay. And so here, this is a little bit what I was talking about previously where um yeah, the good news is it's Unity is really flexible. The bad news is it's super flexible and complex. So, we're not worried about this or this. And so, I am disabling that stuff. We're just making PC builds of our games. Um, and so now with that in mind, um, yeah, these windows are long and inscrutable. And so, Here it is. Rendering real-time reflection probes. Yes. You know the kind of thing you would love to have happen is that if you select every frame or if once you select real time that this box got checked. They're they're working on it. And and boom, you see the big difference like immediately. Right. So now when the player moves around, we'll see uh the reflections change on the player uh as we move. Let's see. Right. So if I get out of here, um you see that the reflections go away on the player over there. Right. And we're reflecting. There's not a whole lot in this scene, but you can see how this works now, right? So, um, yeah, and you know, all of this is I would leave all of this where it is. So, the the resolution of the reflections is very very low, 128 pixels, right? Um, but most of the time, I mean, I was trying to make this very obvious. We're not, you know, cranking the smoothness up. So it looks like that because that just usually doesn't even look good. And so the reflections themselves are being blurred and having them be low res actually requires less blurring because they'll be blurry as is. And so that all works out there. But now uh we have um this happening. So where where would you use this? Most of the time the real- time reflection probe should be you know, in our instances, the player, right? Unless there's some sort of like, you know, very critical like mirror surface where, you know, like the player's going to walk up to a mirror and you need them to see themselves. This would do that. And it's actually a really interesting topic. I found a couple really good historical accounts of like the just computer graphics um tricks and techniques for trying to do mirrors throughout the history of gaming because it's not this was not an easy lift like one one of the possible solutions earlier you like Mario Galaxy level or N64 Mario probably was like at one point they had like duplicated the entire scene so that you would actually see it through a window like and it looked like a mirror. It just seemed like an insane way to do it, but it just turned out like that was like the the easiest way given the system or something like that. But any anyways, um yeah, so real time reflection probes I would say should be reserved just for the player itself. But then yeah, if you have some highly reflective um object in the scene, you can put a baked reflection probe on it and then that object itself will become reflective, right? And so if we had some other static thing here like this and it was big. There we go. And down here and over here. And then I made a reflection probe. Light reflection probe. Put it underneath the sphere. Reset it. Make it a little bit bigger. Um, and so now if we say bake, uh, it does it. But you we're not seeing a whole lot because the material itself isn't super We put this on it. There we go. Right. And so if I turn this off. Yeah. Let's move it over. Let's move this over here. here. Yeah, I think it's updating as we move it around. You can tell it to update that way. But I delete this. I think it's running into this one. Yeah. That's what's polluting our demonstration. Let's turn the one off on the player. And over here, we're move this around. We should be seeing those show up over there. Or are we not seeing that? This one is turned off. So it's not We're not seeing that on this one. But over here. Yeah. So that's what should happen. But why isn't it doing it when we bake skybox importance cube map? is it just we need to go into play mode. No. All right, we're one checkbox away from success there. I mean this is what it will look like when it you know calculates but it's not showing the baked one perhaps because of the quality settings will look but usually the way this in our student games the way this mostly applies is you know there's something reflective that you're moving around and you want to see reflections on. So, and then turning up the metallic and smoothness on this puddle. And then in order for it not just to be random reflection of the skybox, you're going to want to put a reflection probe on, you know, like in this area. >> I'm not sure how to do that. So, that would be something So the I think the floor I mean the walls look really great. I mean like the green stuff on the floor doesn't really scream submarine to me like >> paint. >> Yeah. Looks like m you know like",

And so I believe uh we'll see what Bose says here in his, but um what he I believe what he ended up doing was he used two separate trigger zones.

And then in the sound effects there's now this is only going to function if it's a 3D sound.

So right now I have the list of assets that need to get done. Uh, I have all the characters, I have the buildings. Uh I thinking of minimizing and cutting down some of these uh assets. I am trying to bring in a lot of uh what I can of like buildings and different like stuff like that uh from outside resources like Adobe Stock and uh Fab and kind of taking them and modifying them in Blender to kind of fit the style of my world so I have something to kind of start off with and then taking them into Substance Painter and texturing them so they fit the style. Um >> yeah. So just being strategic there. what you're probably not going to be able to do that entire workflow for everything, right? So trying to pick pick your spots. What's what's going to matter more, right? So Jack spending a lot of time on the pipes makes a lot of sense because the whole thing is going to be pipes, right? >> See, I have it all broken down. I am going to focus on the buildings first that have the characters you interact with them. Uh this is the breakdown uh flowchart of the story. So you like and the game. So, you open the title screen, you got play and quit, and then maybe like an option for a resume. I'm not really sure if I'm going to include like a saving mechanic because Yeah, we don't have a saving mechanic. I'll think about it this weekend. Maybe if there's some sort of simple mo mostly, you know, you got to win it this time. You know, think of it as a rogue. It's not really uh that choice based right now. Uh so the screen starts out black and you just hear the voices of Margaret's friend, Veronica, talking to her. As the game slowly fades in, you briefly get a first-p person perspective of Margaret waking up and sitting on a chair in her office. There are a few flashes of a real realistic perspective as you're coming to. So you're kind of in that first person perspective. I think it would be cool if uh you could kind of switch between first and uh third person view, but I'm not sure how realistic that expectation is. So I'm not see >> I mean so yeah if you wanted to do that you could have essentially a cinem machine camera that you set up you know wherever your character's face is right um that is set up as a cinem machine camera so that your controls for the character it's a it's a link link to the character. Uh, plus Cinem Machine. I try it with just a regular Cinem Machine camera. So if we have this one here, right? And so I want this camera to be here. So I uh select the camera. I go control shift F. There we go. Now this game view matches the scene view. And then this is just a you know stationary simple cinem machine camera. So this this this will be the simplest solution in terms of firstperson camera. Now we just simply do this. And now if we play the game we will be in that view. Actually, that doesn't work because the character controller assumes you can see some of some of the controls for the character controller are in screen space. So the screen is locked to that. Parent this to that. Same problem. Right. Because now when I go Yeah. we get this feedback loop. How are we going straight in that direction? But over here spinning around. I mean, if I just position it a little bit more dynamically, does that work? No. Yeah. The character controller is based on in screen space unless there was a checkbox there for first person where it would do it in absolute space. So, well, actually it's still not quite oriented correctly. What if it was oriented correctly? This is back here. This is pointed this way. That's the way our character faces. Let's see. Do I have any better results? Forward and forward. Forward is forward. But left and right are crazy. This is a good way to get your player to throw up. What if you were slightly behind? So, here. And back like that, but then you turned off the mesh renderer. Does that make sense? Why is backwards still strange? That works somewhat. As long as your turn speed was way down, which is adjustable, isn't it? There's a turn speed or switch direction distance or something like that, dodge distance. Oh, rotation smooth time. Um, let's turn that up. Okay. Yeah, having it be a child is no good. What if it was just a very close parent or very close cinem machine camera but without um Yeah. So, turning on and off. I mean, I think a big part of being first person is going to be just, you know, you can turn on and off this component with any event, right? So, this is the mesh renderer. Everything else is still live on the controller. Uh, yeah, I think putting it in the hierarchy was I thought it would be a simple solution, but I think it probably is just over complicated. And so now if the Cinem machine there, let's add. So, the Cinem machine is essentially here, right? first person just behind, but we wanted to follow but not do all the rotation business, right? Which is going to make it seem more first persony. And so under extension, we want position control. Follow this character and where did the camera go? Let's get rid of this random thing. Oh, okay. There's the thing. This is here. Camera offset. Let's bring it right up against the player. Okay, let's see how that works. Rotate with follow target. One sec. There we go. still spin a little bit when we go backwards, but for a momentary first-person thing, I think that works. So yeah, cinem machine camera and then hard lock to target rotate with follow target and under here. Where was my offset? Where did that go away? If I remove this, does the offset come back? Yeah. Okay. So, this gives me um some first-person control and then our standard um cinem machine free look cam where this one's pointed at again the player. There we go. And so now just by turning on and off the cameras with the camera controller camera manage camera man it's called camera manager um you should be able to go between first person and third person and so in that camera manager yeah uh you might have something right so here we are first person moving around picking stuff up and then we come out at some point to third person and continue playing the game doing our stuff and then we can switch back and forth between those as we would want. So yeah, don't put them the camera as a child of the object in super super simple situations like if you had very simple character controller and very simple camera follow that works again there's no it's very hard locked but it doesn't work in this situation when we have the complexity of cinem machine and so this one you know our first person equivalent here I'll see if I can dial down on this anymore but hard lock to target rotate with follow target those things have it you know and as long as you position it. The next thing would be you know in the events that actually turn on and off the cameras would be turning on and off the mesh renderer when you go into that first person view which would give you you know you have the camera either right behind or right where the character is and it would you would have the impression of looking through their eyes because you wouldn't be seeing their body at that point. Okay, good question because I think some other people are thinking about doing that kind of thing. >> Um, married to that idea. And then after Veronica tells you to go and connect with your fellow town folk, she tells you you need to collect two fun facts today. You can either talk to her again and she will give you the repeating line. I'm happy to keep talking, but if you spend all day with me, you can't collect any fun facts. And the second option is to exit the real estate",

You have Lilia at the salon, you have the widows at the motel, and then you have uh Marin Ble at the optometrist. and then Eddie at the pawn shop. And you can only talk to two of these characters because I've implement decided to implement a energy system where you only have two bars of energy or two little points of energy for the day. And you can only talk to people if you have enough energy. Consequently though, you earn a fun fact by talking to people and that's how you complete the game and talk to your friend. But there is a um event that happens regardless of who you talk to and you get a fun fact from this event, too. Even though you don't have enough um because you will have to talk to two of these characters for this event to happen. So you after you talk two fun facts from the various shopkeepers. You run into Dalia Calder who is the additional fun fact and you get one additional fun fact from her. You have a little interaction. You return to the real estate boutique and tell Veronica three fun facts you got. She congratulates you on getting more fun facts than she expected you and seems pretty excited that you potentially met a new friend. Dalia. You head home and maybe it looks like time has passed. I'm not ready to that idea either. After you go to your house, the screen fades to black. The screen fades back in and you're thrust into a first-p person point of view. You wander around in the dark house hearing knocking at your front door. You open the front door and the scene fades out again. The scene fades into a cut scene where Margaret is opening her door and looking down at a horrified expression. As the camera pans out, you see the head of Dalia, a Poppy on Margaret's Porsche, and then the credits. So that's the whole game. >> It seems to take a really dark turn at the end. Uh but let's >> So the game logic I have is >> I mean are these conversations like is there an under undercurrent of uh that something else is happening in this >> to interact player enters the zone UI pop message pops up E. Uh that interaction will be for both uh opening doors. So, entering a new scene uh because I'm gonna have different scenes be for uh different rooms, the different shopkeepers rooms. And then we also have UI overlay for the fun fact and the energy section. And then we have uh the fun fact collection. A character interacts with one of the fork shopkeepers by pressing E to interact. After the dialogue is complete, the collection manager adds a fun fact to the UI. Uh once the UI manager has two fun facts, the Dalia event will interaction will trigger and you can no longer interact with the other characters. Uh then you have the Dollalia interaction to choose a trigger zone by >> Marilyn says yes dot dot dot >> against Dalia. So, it activates that trigger zone and then we have that dialogue. And then after that Dolly interaction is triggered, you will get different dialogue options for Veronica when you go visit her. Next, and then we have the open door. Click open door that opens entering a new scene. Um, and then you can, and there's another scene entering thing is you can go all the way to the left screen to go home after you have talked to Veronica the last time. And then, uh, we have camera translations where the camera looks different. I have this fun little thing that I thought about the the alley that makes you dissociate. So, if you walk by this one alleyway in between a couple buildings, the camera pans and just looks at that alleyway. As long as you're standing in that trigger zone, and all you can do is just look in that alleyway. Um, and then have dialogue. You interact, triggers dialogue with character. After they talk, you're given different options, fun things to say. It's just kind of fun different things to say. Uh, it'll have different responses, but it won't really affect the overall story. So, if I don't have time to implement that, then that's something that could be cut. Um, but yeah, that's that's what I've got for the planning so far. I've uh pulled some different assets. So far, the church asset is not my asset. is something I pulled, I believe, from Adobe Stock. Right now, Margaret is moving so terribly slow. Uh, I need to speed her up, but I did change the animation a bit. I'm still thinking about changing it a bit more. Uh, something really weird happened when I brought this into Substance Painter. The, uh, textures got all corrupted and it looks kind of funky. So, I think I'm going to fix that. I might react to the building. Is it Is she talking about the building? I think she's talking about the building >> to retexture that. Um, because I had it looking more like clay, but that's fine. it doesn't look so good. I of course modeled the stairs and uh the roads and stuff and then I have the other stuff kind of the other buildings um gray boxed in. Right now it feels kind of big because it just feels weird with the boxes there and I don't think they're super to scale. I am scaling everything in a Blender file. Uh making sure everything is similar scale. Um I have this little like Blender file that I'm making sure everything's like similar scale to. But yeah, I've been >> Okay. So yeah. Yeah. I mean the the the Blender scale is fine, but just remember everything gets overridden by the Unity scale. And so, you know, bringing it in and making sure the scale not setting the default scale here, setting the default scale with where's the mesh? Um in in here under model scale factor, right? So when you bring it in, like if you keep bringing it in, the building is way too big, then coming in here and adjusting this down to the regular size of the building. Not adjusting all of the scales on the game objects is going to be where you would want to do that. Again, we want to make sure most everything is 111. I've been busy. I've been uh, you know, working on, let's see, pop my porch up, building some assets. So, I have like a Blender file called little L plane, which is the street you're walking down. Um, and I got like the different assets there, and I'm going to scale them all to the building, which is to scale. So, and then I'll bring them all back uh individually into Unity. Uh, and then I >> Okay. Yeah. So, that just I I think I would what you're conceptually what you're doing there is very clear thinking. It just I think you're gonna save yourself time if you just make a second Unity scene that has that stuff. And so you have the building and then when you bring in your new things, use the Unity scaler there that we just looked at to set the scale and then you'll be fine. >> Have let's see. I have the props um like a bike boxes, mailbox, um you know, plants, different stuff that's going to be there. I haven't really focused on the terrain yet. It's going to be a pretty simple like sides scrolling back and forth. So yeah, I'd love to know how to implement that sidescroller and also um just any advice about how to go about things. Thank you so much for watching. >> Hey, the side scroller like with the camera so that the camera stays to the side as we're moving back and forth. So cinem machine follow camera no rotation composer remove or actually it's probably easier just to start with nothing. So just regular Cinem machine camera. Okay. And so then let's say that this is going to be my side view over here like this. And then say I want to move this camera to this view. Control shift F. There we go. Now on this camera, it gets the under position. I think hard lock to this follow. And so now if I move left and right. There we go. I believe this is what we're we want. What she wants, right? Because you have your whole street laid out this like this. And you want your, you know, when the flower character is out on what is the flower character's name? It's a Margaret uh is out on the street, you'll switch to this camera, which essentially gives you this 2D view. And even if Margaret goes forward or backwards, the camera stays like this. There's no rotating over here. So yeah, this is a regular Cinem Machine camera with the not the hard lock, the follow. It I think is the functionality you want there. You're you're Maline. Is that is that what you're talking about for that situation there? Again, you talk fast and then you sped it up. So, it was like I could barely get it, but I think I think that's what she asked, right? Yeah. Yeah. Let let me know there if that's that's correct. I think that's what you're after. Cool. That's looking really great. And I look forward to this dialogue that's going to have this undercurrent of um something much more sinister happening in this flower super happy flower town.",

Thank you so much for watching. >> Hey, the side scroller like with the camera so that the camera stays to the side as we're moving back and forth. So cinem machine follow camera no rotation composer remove or actually it's probably easier just to start with nothing. So just regular Cinem machine camera. Okay. And so then let's say that this is going to be my side view over here like this. And then say I want to move this camera to this view. Control shift F. There we go. Now on this camera, it gets the under position. I think hard lock to this follow. And so now if I move left and right. There we go. I believe this is what we're we want. What she wants, right? Because you have your whole street laid out this like this. And you want your, you know, when the flower character is out on what is the flower character's name? It's a Margaret uh is out on the street, you'll switch to this camera, which essentially gives you this 2D view. And even if Margaret goes forward or backwards, the camera stays like this. There's no rotating over here. So yeah, this is a regular Cinem Machine camera with the not the hard lock, the follow. It I think is the functionality you want there. You're you're Maline. Is that is that what you're talking about for that situation there? Again, you talk fast and then you sped it up. So, it was like I could barely get it, but I think I think that's what she asked, right? Yeah. Yeah. Let let me know there if that's that's correct. I think that's what you're after. Cool. That's looking really great. And I look forward to this dialogue that's going to have this undercurrent of um something much more sinister happening in this flower super happy flower town."

So yeah, depending on what you want to do here with the eyes and the blinking, you may go back to Substance Painter and erase the face. That way you can always have the face controlled by decals. Or in your case, you are correct and I was wrong. Having this would allow the decal decal to project over top of it and essentially cover up the face. I mean, it wouldn't it wouldn't look like that because I assume this is the same color as Forso's face usually. So either way, >> it doesn't like move. You don't have to change it like that. Um, I think it'll be cute. Add a little bit of character. Um, cuz it's got a TV screen so for a head. So, we can probably just like swap between it and not need a transitional face. Um, so for >> you guys read the the comic with the TV screen head guys. Um, Saga. I I I read the first bunch of it years ago. I think he finished it up. Who is it? It's um I think it's it's almost certainly been optioned into a TV show or movie or something. Saga. I can't remember the author. Brian Kvon. That's right. Make sure there's not something wildly inappropriate on the screen. Okay. Uh yeah, all the quoteunquote uh what are at the beginning bad guys are all uh TV head. At some point there's like a like grand admiral who has like this giant flat screen for it which is funny. Um but yeah it's good. He also did why the last man which did become a TV show although I didn't see that. >> For my rocks here I really like just kind of like the low poly look. I really think it looks nice. I have a these two are different colors just so we can have some variation. I might make a third rock. We just got a big rock and a small rock and might make it like an even smaller rock or something like that. Um, here's them like this. I had a fun time giving them like more irregular shapes. And I think overall they look pretty cute. And then we have my palm tree. This one was pretty simple. Just copy and pasting the curving it and then making random little leaves. It looks a little janky up top, but you're not going to be able to see the top part. So, there's that. >> Okay. So, here, right, this number one, when you go to export these, there's a couple different levels of making this more performant for the game. Number one, don't solidify the leaves. Okay, those would just having them I assume you made them just with a plane and then put the solidify modifier on it. Um, in the game just having them be flat and then telling Unity that this material is double-sided will give you the look of leaves. And then the other sort of minimum thing you want to do in terms of optimizing this is make sure that you uh join all of these parts together into a single mesh object so that each tree is not one two you know like 20 mesh objects because that's going to be you'll run into a performance problem you know maybe at like 10 trees then right because each you would have 2,000 objects or something already in the scene with just 10 trees.

Like you can you can with you turn on Vulcan, you can have 10 million vertices in one object and it's still going to work fairly well. So keep that in mind. So here a couple things to do, right? At least join this together into one thing. That's the bare minimum. Second, if it's not too hard, turn off the um when you join it may mess up some of the modifiers. And so you need to number one apply modifiers. Number two, join. Then you'll be >> I might make coconuts and have little coconuts um that are either on here or scattered on the ground cuz I think that could be cute. So yeah, there's there's what I have so far. I'll be able to finish this later this week once I get home. But yeah, uh thank you guys and happy holidays. >> Yeah. Okay, so the these look cool. They fit your vibe for the game. Absolutely.

Unfortunately, still got some things to definitely do. Unfortunately, just blocking out the game environment. Yeah, I still don't have like any really >> Yeah, they could really use some like sound baffling in those booths, huh? >> Any interactivity in it yet. I still got to add a lot more like to it, but I'll show what I got. So basically I blocked out the game like the frame of it was there for here. >> Cool. >> Still have to like make stuff in Blender and put in here. I have some ideas. Yeah. But Here's where I match like I'm making progress. So, but I did have one when I I brought the character my character in here imported like that all the animations for it. But I did have one issue with it. I guess I'll start playing the game. I guess I'll play the just should talk about stuff while playing the game. One issue, I imported my character and tried to import the textures from Substance Painter, but wasn't able to get them correct. It's a little off here. Like I tried down here, you can see. >> Okay. It's almost certainly because the UV mapping on the character that you rigged in Blender is different than the one that got painted. So go back to the charact the character that you exported from Blender, the one that has all the animations, right? You have to export that mesh as an FBX. >> Okay, that's step one. Step two, open up Substance Painter. Okay. And go to up here in the corner project settings and point the project at the new FBX and then export from Substance Painter. It's just the fact that the Substance Painter UVs don't match these UVs. The UVs, right, it's a little it can be tough to understand. You're like, the UVs are all about texturing, so isn't it in the material? No, it's not in the material. that's in the UV data is stored in the FBX file in the mesh file. It's a 2D grid and it's just essentially like a one database of like this vertex is at X, Y, and Z in 3D space and then a separate table that says this vertex, this same vertex is at XY space in UV space. Right? So just matching those up. And so it's in in the mesh, not the textures themselves, but the textures are laid out in UV space. So that like the layout of the pixels needs to work with whatever the UV map is. And so in Substance Painter, you just need to go into the settings for the project there. Okay. So, edit project configuration. Okay. And then file, select, get the the one that you just the one that the one that's animated from Blender. Okay. That one. >> Yeah. Because this something happened along the way and the UVs changed in Blender. uh and they didn't match whatever the UVs were when you painted the object. Now, when you bring it in here, you may notice that it looks a little wrong. The face that you drew should line up 100% still. You may just have to change some of the masks so that they work with the new UVs. But for the most part, once you get that fixed, then you can export this, bring it in, and it'll match in Substance Painter in Unity at the end. So right here, select this needs to be the the newest FBX, the one that you're actually using in Unity. >> Yeah. But the important thing for everyone to understand here that that I think is legitimately confusing is like where are the UVs? They're in the mesh. Always in the mesh file. >> Didn't really work out, but yeah, it's supposed to. I'm wondering at this point if I should just like move on from that. Just accept this because it's >> No, I think we can fix this. Yeah. >> Much time. >> In fact, I would work on that first. >> Might want to just focus on other stuff. Forgetting other stuff in this environment for these last few weeks. But yeah, here's my character animation, run animation, idle animation, jump animation. >> Great. That all looks really good. I'll show you what it's supposed to look like from substance painter. So, you know, yeah, this is what >> uh Yeah. And so what whatever the layout of UVs is here. I wonder why there's all this sparkly stuff. >> What's that? >> Yeah. Yeah. That's confusing. >> Supposed to look like could have to do with this UV unwrap. Remember you said it did have some issues here. Little Okay. But you told me I should just move on. So I did that. >> Yeah. So I'm thinking I don't know showing up do about getting on my character at this pointless and that's what I'm thinking like it's not matter just >> yeah I got interacted with the character here just with no real face.

Just taking some >> go >> just take some time to do all this stuff along with other two other classes and other stuff. So, but >> so my progress >> platforms. >> Okay.

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 26, 2025 Student Feedback: Terrain and Asset Organization Hello, my name is Adrian Negula and um this is my update on my game um modular assets. Um I was able to um >> so on the mountains here the turning down the turn turning up the roughness is going to prevent some of this like sparkly super super sparkly flickery stuff >> to make some v variation of trees like for example this is um a dead tree for a haunted forest. So the tree the did you make the trees with the terrain tool? >> But I mean when you placed when you place these trees on the terrain >> they're each like separate objects. put them inside. >> Okay. Uh yeah, I mean this amount of stuff might might be better to do with the prefab painting thing on the terrain. um the prefab brush. But I mean, are you in play mode yet? No, we're just sort of looking around. Do do you go into play mode during the video? >> I mean, is it slow when you're going into play mode? just >> the like the like in terms of like it playing back or just sort of like where the >> the debugging basically. >> Okay. >> I'm thinking of adding um thunder here. I already added the rain for um particle effects. I also added a snow forest over here with snow also over here. Um I w for um anything animated I was able to animate the doors to open and close when the player gets close. Um over here um I was able to decorate a lot of the area as you can see. Um I was able to fill in the inside to make it like an actual walkable tunnel. Yep. Um, I'm thinking of making this into a movable platform to like rise up like an elevator. I'm thinking of adding a maze to make an actual dungeon. >> Okay, there's a ton here already, right? What I mean, my general advice is going to be let's just pick one of these areas and try to polish that, right? Because think about the there's the game of game design and then there's the metagame of your career, right? And in the metag game, you want to have the best stuff possible in your portfolio. And so having a smaller thing that's much that's very well polished is more valuable than a giant thing that is not as high quality, right? And so you you know you're not allowed to say I'm going to add at all for the rest of the semester, right? You've got so much here already. Let's let's just focus focus on like just make like I like the the wall with the forest behind the wall and then the mountains next to it. that that was I thought visually cool like like the the justosition of that and like maybe we could just focus on that you know like the character like walking up to the you know like the idea of this like forest behind a wall kind of like a great wall kind of situation like that part I think is is already kind of visually successful. So, but uh the there's so much here that there's not going to be time to to polish this and for the sake of like the class having something, you know, that's high quality to show as your work in the class, you know, just focus on one section. And it would be my suggestion that the section would be like the the forest area up there. I think is where you want to focus right now. later down the line once you get some more experience like filling all this out that's just like a much longer project. Right. Right. So we're m make we're more in terms of your conceptualization of the thing. Think think think of this project more as like we're making a level of a game versus like what you're conceiving of as an entire game. Okay? Because you're conceiving of an entire game as like some sort of Elden Ring style scale of thing, right? And that's not it. We don't, you know, it's too big. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Bring it. Just just just dial it in. Dial it in. Right. >> My imagination basically. >> Yeah. Yeah. Just dial it in a little bit. Um, and the good what I did good on for this part was um able to um do a lot of progress on the map like the assets, coloring up the map, making it look nice and cool. I'm thinking of over here like um for the interactive systems besides the doors, I'm thinking of having a a day shift or like be able to like turn the day into night and having a night sky. I don't know how to do that. Um and also being able to um um add darkness to certain areas. Like for example, if you're like inside the dungeon, it's all dark and you need the torches to light you up your way. >> Okay. Yeah. Again, let's just focus on the forest. Let like let's just say character, you know, opens finds a key to open the door to the forest, enters the forest, and then like we we search for things to collect in the forest. That sounds like a manageable thing, right? and then later later on at some other time dungeons and and the other stuff but the forest is I think the forest is the furthest along here in terms of the look and feel of everything. >> Um over here kind of also the same thing but without darkening the sky too much like making the sky blue but your surroundings all dark. >> No sound like a >> and same with the dragon here to make it more scary. Um for the technical stuff like the managers um managers um cameras uh all of that stuff. Um sadly I had a setback that mean uh and what I mean is that I actually went backwards sadly because um this guy sadly for some reason um his animations were not working like when he's running because of the jumping animation. Um, and because I was trying to fix him, his animations were I don't know how. Um, I'm thinking maybe why now before I did not know his animations are linked to my primary player, which all which um ruined his animations, which honestly I feel like that I did really horrible on like the technical stuff. I feel like I went back. >> Yeah. So let's let's table the enemy for now and just get the player working. So I mean again like my permanent advice on all these things like going back to try and fix is going to be way more difficult than just sort of like taking the parts and just building just build it again from so that you can you mean one you get more practice doing the thing right which is something I'm trying to emphasize here like just going through it once is just it's just not enough right like going through it multiple times isn't uh isn't like a penalty. It's an opportunity to practice >> really bad. Basically, a big setback, major setback. >> It's not a huge setback, right? You just, you know, just you just have to mentally commit to that. Like, okay, table the enemy. I'm just going to work on the player. Let's get that going. Like, just some very clear goals. I want to be able to open this door with the player animating and then collect these things in the forest, right? And because even when you break it down into those sort of like like okay well just these three these three very simple tasks now you guys know enough that like one of those quoteunquote simple tasks can uninadvertently balloon into you know this day crashing series of technical events right uh it's complicated the games are complicated right so just breaking it down to those three things. I think those three things are definitely achievable. >> Back instead of going forward, I went backwards. And also with the camera too, it also got I also I also ruined it by accident. A lot of the stuff with the technical stuff like the game health manager, I tried to like make it work, but it wasn't working. It did appear on screen just that it wasn't lowering the health when the guy went to him. Sadly, he would go in between. Um, I wasn't able to make the health manager work. Um, I was able to make um the doors work over here. Um, but the other stuff sadly I wasn't able to get it to work. >> Okay. Yeah. So, for next week, let's try to get it to there. Like, I can walk up to the doors, the doors open, and I can go get stuff in the forest, whatever that stuff is. But then, yeah, the primary thing with the forest, you've got a lot of trees there, and it seems to be running okay right now. just making at least rotate the trees different directions, right? Um, actually, can't you do that? What is the shortcut for this? P. >> Yeah. Yeah. The prefab pane has, you know, once you get it into the system, that would be the preferable way. Okay. But if you just have a bunch of objects um in here, you can use just like in Blender, you can script in the parameter in the parameters. Um, I just forget what it's not quite position. I've only seen a handful of times. Yeah, I forget off the top of my head. There's a different thing. A script to do this would also be useful. But in the other you should watch do you see the other Unity tutorial I linked to on Discord about the terrain >> in the Discord channel. I think it was I mean Bo and I were going back and forth, but um yeah, here. Scroll back up. Here we go. This is only like 10 minutes long. Watch this one. Um this is You want to probably delete the trees that you have. take your tree and load it into a brush. It'll allow you to paint the trees into the space so that then you'll also be able to in the brush give them random height and random rotation. So that looks way more like a forest and less, you know, more forest, less um, you know, yours looks kind of like an orchard because everything's like in a in a line, you know. Okay, awesome. So, your your whole your focus is focus at this point, right? Like just dial in the vision a little bit. Okay. Okay. Because it's coming along. You did done a ton of stuff. Just try to point it, focus it a little bit more. >> You're in a zone. Yes. Gavin.",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 26, 2025 Student Feedback: Snow Materials and Trees >> Hello everybody. Uh, let me show you what I did this week. Um, I didn't get much done this week or well, I did I got a few things done, but I didn't get as much as I wanted to. Mainly because, uh, >> yeah, this is a story of everyone's week. I accidentally put too much time into my other animation assignment, ABC240, which is good in a certain in a sense because that means next week I could focus more on this because I'm a little ahead in that. But uh so yeah, I didn't get as much done. Um I did uh for the modular design. >> So what are the red boxes going to be? >> Um they're just placehold. I mean the most the red boxes are going to be where characters are. >> Oh, okay. >> Made a few different types of snow >> there. It's just a placeholder for a collectible >> up up there on top of the building. That one. >> Uh actually, yeah, that one as well. But also the one like in front of that tree. >> Oh, okay. >> Uh shapes that I can put on the ground because I want this to take place during winter. Um and then also I made a few different types of trees. I made, you can see, I made one stump, two different types of branches, and a few different tree shapes like for the leaves. Uh, and I made a few prefabs here, show that off. Same with the snow. And the snow is really good because I can kind of shape it around, scale it around to really just make a ton of different shapes from it. Um, and then I also made the two different materials you asked us to make. So, I made an ocean one. Okay. So, the problem with making an ocean in Substance uh painter is that, you know, you can't animate anything in Substance Painter. Substance painter only outputs static textures. So >> that it's like kind of animated. >> Um I mean, yeah, what you're doing, what you're describing is technically possible. It wouldn't look anything like water. It would just look like blinking textures, you know? >> Well, you know, you're not even going to really see the water anyway because probably the fog. >> Okay. Well, the the like you ended up with a nice looking water here. The thing you could do in Unity is animate the UV so that at least it's like it's not going to look like it's flowing, but it will look like it's moving. At least um here I'll let you finish and we'll see. uh Monday we can do because it's kind of like the continuation of our particle discussion from Monday meaning this coming Monday we'll because the next a lot of you know what is going to be visual effects stuff you know is like I don't know 70% particle and then 30% shader texture tricks techniques that kind of stuff and and water stuff tends to be a mixture But this kind of water is the second >> for which I'll use probably on the ground or on the on the ocean that's going to be really far down that you can fall into. And then also I just made a snow material that I could probably use for something cuz it's there's going to be a lot of snow everywhere. I'm sure I can find a way to use that. Um, yeah, if you just threw that, if you just made like a curve, like slightly curved plane so that you could, you know, just sort of have it kind of like poke through so it would look like snow coming up over top of areas of the ground. That would probably work really well. >> Let me see what else. What else? >> No animation. It's actually like candy or something in Astrobot. >> Well, I'll talk about the the systems, the interactive system I made. I made technically two interactive systems. I basically made a a simple collection system. Um, this is just a placeholder. When I reach this, I I get chocolate. Um, and but the chocolate basically, and this is the second interactive when you get the chocolate, the chocolate is like a power up, and you can jump higher. And yes, this is higher than it was before. This is much higher for Mr. Peppermint. I don't know if I'm going to keep this necessarily. Um, >> I mean that's this sounds like a whether it's chocolate or whatever, >> you know, the way you have your world set up like being able to jump higher would be like a like an emergent gate that you could use, you know, like Metroid Vania style thing where, you know, like there's this second part of the game, whatever you want to make the next part, you know, like you can't get up to whatever the top of that building is or something until you get the power up allows you to jump up to the top of the building and continue the rest of the stuff. Right. So, it's not a gate in that like it has a trigger zone and you know like it's a bespoke thing in the game. It's just that like you build it such that you can't get up there until you have this thing. >> Yeah, I was going to have that and then I tried to do the bumper system but it wasn't working. >> No, the bumper is not going to work with this character controller. >> Yeah, I I did this instead but I think this works. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um the Yeah, the bumper doesn't work with this character controller. >> I don't know. I'll see. >> Uh what do you guys think? Should I keep it? Uh because I I wanted to do something like this so that you can like basically get on the roof of a building. That's the main thing. >> Yeah. I mean the design of the world like it really feels like a place which is great. your your like the sense of scale feels really great. The Yeah. sort of doubling down on the cartoony nature of the stuff like like what if like Yeah. That jump wasn't just slightly higher, but now like you can jump literally like three stories up to the top of like the other buildings, you know? >> Well, there is Yeah. I I don't want to make it so you can get outside the boundaries of the game. That's the only thing. >> Yeah. I mean, just setting up big invisible walls, you know, like there, of course, there's more elegant ways to >> do that, but like given the scope of our resources, like that's a perfectly fine thing, right? like because it's that's part of the game industry that really uh is not, you know, not super glamorous, but like in order to make stuff like that happen, it's completely thankless kind of things like like, oh yeah, I couldn't get out of the canyon in Horizon Forbidden West. And most of the people don't try and get out of the canyon, you know, but like they need to have 40 people on quality control and quality assurance like trying to run against the thing and you know like it's a huge mechanism, right? So we want to have our intended path through the game, but I don't expect you guys to be like ensuring that people cannot go off said path, right? It's hard in the metag game of the class. It's hard, right? like for me trying to make sure that you don't go off the path to the point where you fall down into the water and die right like like that's also virtually impossible for me to assure that that doesn't happen right over the course of the semester main reason I have this I also anyway the I made two different decals I made a simple decal that I can over like on the street for the lines and then also another one on the side here. >> Yeah, that does a lot to really, you know, you know, now it feels like a street, you know, because we got the >> To be honest, I gotta make I'm going to use decals more than this, but I just needed to make something kind of quick because the assignment's already late. Um, but uh yeah, I didn't get as much done this week, but uh I will definitely have more to show next week because I'll be more focused on this assignment. Um, and yeah, I guess that's it. >> Yeah. And then for everybody, I mean, you should be hearing it on this live stream, like just adding the one ambience track, right? Again, we spend 90% of our time thinking about the visual part of the games, but the sonic part of the games in terms of like feeling like you're in the environment, making it a a much more powerful experience. Right? I use this the the upside of it cannot be understated, right? in terms of like the impact of the music, the impact of the ambience. It's huge. And then in the other way, you know, like a lot of times when I'm like watching the news on TV, I mute the TV and it like steals the power from the television. Now it's just like a thing that's flickering in the room and occasionally I check in on it versus like having it squawk at me all the time. Um, but you know, I may have some issues. So here's James.",

Um, >> I mean that's this sounds like a whether it's chocolate or whatever, >> you know, the way you have your world set up like being able to jump higher would be like a like an emergent gate that you could use, you know, like Metroid Vania style thing where, you know, like there's this second part of the game, whatever you want to make the next part, you know, like you can't get up to whatever the top of that building is or something until you get the power up allows you to jump up to the top of the building and continue the rest of the stuff. Right. So, it's not a gate in that like it has a trigger zone and you know like it's a bespoke thing in the game. It's just that like you build it such that you can't get up there until you have this thing. >> Yeah, I was going to have that and then I tried to do the bumper system but it wasn't working. >> No, the bumper is not going to work with this character controller. >> Yeah, I I did this instead but I think this works. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um the Yeah, the bumper doesn't work with this character controller. >> I don't know. I'll see. >> Uh what do you guys think? Should I keep it? Uh because I I wanted to do something like this so that you can like basically get on the roof of a building. That's the main thing. >> Yeah. I mean the design of the world like it really feels like a place which is great. your your like the sense of scale feels really great. The Yeah. sort of doubling down on the cartoony nature of the stuff like like what if like Yeah. That jump wasn't just slightly higher, but now like you can jump literally like three stories up to the top of like the other buildings, you know? >> Well, there is Yeah. I I don't want to make it so you can get outside the boundaries of the game. That's the only thing. >> Yeah. I mean, just setting up big invisible walls, you know, like there, of course, there's more elegant ways to >> do that, but like given the scope of our resources, like that's a perfectly fine thing, right? like because it's that's part of the game industry that really uh is not, you know, not super glamorous, but like in order to make stuff like that happen, it's completely thankless kind of things like like, oh yeah, I couldn't get out of the canyon in Horizon Forbidden West. And most of the people don't try and get out of the canyon, you know, but like they need to have 40 people on quality control and quality assurance like trying to run against the thing and you know like it's a huge mechanism, right? So we want to have our intended path through the game, but I don't expect you guys to be like ensuring that people cannot go off said path, right? It's hard in the metag game of the class. It's hard, right? like for me trying to make sure that you don't go off the path to the point where you fall down into the water and die right like like that's also virtually impossible for me to assure that that doesn't happen right over the course of the semester main reason I have this I also anyway the I made two different decals I made a simple decal that I can over like on the street for the lines and then also another one on the side here. >> Yeah, that does a lot to really, you know, you know, now it feels like a street, you know, because we got the >> To be honest, I gotta make I'm going to use decals more than this, but I just needed to make something kind of quick because the assignment's already late. Um, but uh yeah, I didn't get as much done this week, but uh I will definitely have more to show next week because I'll be more focused on this assignment. Um, and yeah, I guess that's it. >> Yeah. And then for everybody, I mean, you should be hearing it on this live stream, like just adding the one ambience track, right? Again, we spend 90% of our time thinking about the visual part of the games, but the sonic part of the games in terms of like feeling like you're in the environment, making it a a much more powerful experience. Right? I use this the the upside of it cannot be understated, right? in terms of like the impact of the music, the impact of the ambience. It's huge. And then in the other way, you know, like a lot of times when I'm like watching the news on TV, I mute the TV and it like steals the power from the television. Now it's just like a thing that's flickering in the room and occasionally I check in on it versus like having it squawk at me all the time. Um, but you know, I may have some issues. So here's James."

So over the weekend, I didn't really do too much new modular design. Um I did Yep. We're getting to the part of semester where everyone tells me about the other stuff that's keeping them from doing stuff on this thing. >> At least one of the other things was another one of your classes. >> Yeah. You guys aren't the first that this isn't the first time I've noticed this trend.

So, if anybody else had something to that extent, they could use it as well. Hopefully, it helps out. Um, but I did make a rock um for my one of my modular designs. Um, so these ones can be like I made three different sizes as um you'll see in a minute. And then I also made this signpost which is uh one post and then a part that can be detached and used elsewhere. >> Cool, right? So instead of like popping up a UI saying go this way or whatever, then you know you can have these in the game for the player to use and direct the player much more organically. I mean there's always a chance the player doesn't see them, doesn't know what to do, but like again like trying to Yeah. Like personally as a player, I'm fine with getting to a point in the game where like I I don't know like I I don't know what happened here and and maybe that's it for me in this game, you know, like but you know clearly that's probably not the predominant uh sentiment and people get really mad when you know things don't work or whatever. Um, but yeah, I'm not expecting all of these processes to be foolproof, right? It's part of the risk and reward of making interactive stuff is that the second you make interactive stuff and then you show it to someone, they immediately interact with it in the way that you did not think that they were going to interact with it. like this has been a substantial part of my career and every time I'm shocked, you know, like I do all this trouble, sensors, stuff to make sure people, you know, and then thinking that they'll use it like this and then they break it immediately. Um, yeah, that I mean it's incredible. Yeah. >> Like they say unpredictable. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like the especially in you know making interactive things is not easy, right? like ostensively you're you want your thing to fail gracefully, right? But you know it's not always the case. So, but this is I think a really great solution here. And again, making this modular allows you to just, you know, use it over and over again so you just have one. And then what about writing stuff on this? Should you do that in Substance Painter or what would be the best most flexible way to write stuff on the signposts? >> Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. >> Cuz I was thinking about going through with that cave and mine, you know, entrance. Uh so I could use this like later on around the mine shaft and mines, you know, for like danger signs, warning signs. Um so yeah, those were the only two modular things I made. I didn't make any trees or anything. Uh cuz the pack that I have that the world I have pre-built um already has a bunch of trees and stuff that I used and then added a bunch of things to them. I did mess around with um some of the texture on the terrain. So, I added some grass and like this rock dirt pattern. It's pretty much dirt. It's not rock, but it looks like a it's like clay brained on dried out dirt. And then for the um the prefabs and like asset designing that I did and the decals, I put those over yonder. So, there's the decals that are there. Um, and they will project onto the top of the treasure chest. Um, and >> cool. I really like the exaggerated uh sort of design and shape of these.

Maybe that was just the modular designs for the blinking. Um, but see when you come over here and you stop get off of. So when you turn that on, I mean it turns on the the decal there. And also made a fourth totem. So we'll do that one real quick. So yeah, you can see that I was trying to make the decals like glow, but I probably wasted too much time uh getting that. Okay.

    "video_id": "UCc233WvzNE",
    "search_text": "AVC200 November 26, 2025 Emissive Decal Shader Setup uh input which then you could crank up to make it emissive. So, um the only issue here is you'd want some of them to glow and not other ones like the signpost. So, you want to have control over this. If we edit this, are we gonna have a problem? Uh let's see. So we want to be able to adjust this per material. So up here, these are our inputs on shader graph. Hit plus. I say color and I would label this emissive color. Then select it. Go to settings here. This needs to be a mode HDR so that we can, you know, glow it up. And then, so this is now an input. If you drag it over here, you can connect the input to here. Now, also, I would make its default value something that you could tell if it's working or not. So, white would or whatever. Just something so you can tell it's working. Um, then save this. But let's see if that breaks our decal. Uh, I think I turned the decal off. Wherever this was. Is this it? No, that's a camera. That's a sound. That's something else. Um, let's see. I'll just make a new decal here. And decal. And no, no, no, no, no. It's really critical to spell decal correctly. Okay, there we go. And so now uh if we say new one glow decal, there we go. And Where is this thing? There. There it is. And now if I unfold down here. Yeah, this is the input parameter that we added. And so now, glowy decal. and it didn't seem to break the rest of the decal shader. And so now, yeah, if you want one decal to glow and another one not to glow, just duplicate the material because each material can have its own input setting for the shader. Okay, so the order of events here is add the appropriate input. In our case, it's a color. In order to make it glowy, we need to make sure you switch it to HDR. high dynamic range. Then once you have that configured, drag it into the interface. This represents these inputs. Oh, look at that. They change. I think that's new. Um, and then here you have to route it to wherever you want to go. You know, you could do anything you want between here and here, but we're just simply forwarding this to that input. So, not everybody needs to do that. In that case, that will help Bose's situation quite a bit to work and it won't. So, I tried a bloom effect, a global bloom. Anything I looked online, you know, they said, \"Yeah, you just change it into the the actual colors of it, but yeah, nothing. I tried. I could not get the decals to glow.\" And I saw a bunch of people online that could do that, but yeah, for me, I could not get that to work. But I do like how the button presses activates the glow on the rune and then see as the lid opens, the decals transfer with it. So, >> Oh, okay. So they like more of them show up on the chest, right? Uh as you activate the runes. So that's super cool. Um, the only thing here is that well, now that you got glow, uh, I think perhaps a more obvious, um, way to communicate to the player is either like there's like empty, you know, boxes like where they are or maybe there's like a a very faint version that then, you know, like when it turns on it lights up. So you just, you know, two and be two of them or they overlap or something. Um, so that that's clear. I mean, because I sort of like barely noticed that, but but now that you're able to make them glow, um, the other thing that you could do is when you turn it on is that you could trigger uh a camera at that location and have the camera fly over there real quick so that the player is like obviously sees that this thing is turned on and then it turns off and goes back to the regular control camera. So that you could make that perfectly clear, right? And so that event sequencer is your friend there, right? Like so there's a delay and the camera flies over and then some amount of time after the camera is in place, boom, turns on and you're good to go there. I do like how the button presses, activates the glow on the rune, and then see as the lid opens, the decals transfer with it. So that was pretty cool. Uh, but that's mostly what I worked on over the weekend. And like I said, I probably spent way too much time wasting uh trying to get those to work. But >> yeah, it's really hard. Yeah. And you're you're not alone. I've sunk an uncomfortable amount of time uh especially as you get older. It looks worse. Um in in things that didn't pan out. But um the Yeah, I mean we have a deadline for this at the end of the semester. So, you know, like the for you guys, I would say, you know, ballpark if you're trying some trying to do something for, you know, like two hours, that would feel like the maximum amount of time, you know, I'm not sure what all of your time management strategies are, but like if if you go past that threshold, it should be a Discord post at that point, you know, like and and let us either, you know, try to say like that's a bad idea, stop trying to do it or like here's some else to try, right? I don't I don't want you guys to just pour time into something where you have no no idea, right? In terms of like, does it work like this? I don't know how to test it. I don't know how to, you know, even start to steer myself in the right direction. Right? So, um, that's when you definitely want to reach out. and Bow does it. You know, here's my sign and the boulder that I made. So, the sign is not too big. I made it in respective about, you know, size of my character. The boulders, on the other hand, are a little bit bigger. But we'll zoom. And there's Michelle talking about that. Um, yeah. So, these are the boulders that I made to go around the entrance of the cave into the mineshaft. So they look a lot realistic, you know, from Substance Painter, but you know, it'll change. I'm thinking about changing up the terrain a little bit, but yeah. So kind of did the inside as I was talking about, you know. >> Yeah. So the the inside there, this texture looks a little stretched. The um some of that may be the camera. uh the trip planer shader here in the in this instance because I believe this stuff actually is not on the train. So you should be able to use the separate tripler shader to make sure it doesn't get distorted. >> It all looks like dirt underground. Um the stretching and stuff is a little weird once you get on the mountains and the terrain like once it stretches out, but >> Oh, right. So I guess the sidewalls are the terrain. Uh, so yeah, on the sections where you can I I don't know. I I like the the rock texture a lot better. I might export the rock texture on a plane so that I could use it to paint some of these things, especially for the cave part here. >> You know, I'm thinking about ways to kind of fix that. The rock texture looks really good. >> That's what I did for >> Yeah. Or just put more of those rocks around >> this weekend. And as I said, I'll be out of town for this week. Um, so yeah, I was kind of trying to get everything done and, you know, finished before I left today. Uh, so it's Sunday for me. It'll be Tuesday when you guys watch this. But, oh well, you guys have a great day. Hope you enjoyed. Talk to you later. >> Yeah, it's looking great. And yeah, we we did that deep dive on decals at the beginning. And so, yeah, we're able to make them glow. We're able to access the metallic and ambient occlusion, everything else now. And that all seems to work. So, that all is pretty good news. And yeah, this system here you have going on with like these activating these things to, you know, turn this on. I mean, this symbol seems kind of like from a design purpose like unless you're going to use it again somewhere or like kind of unnecessary. Uh maybe there's just like the blank spots here. again, just trying to lead the player through the through the series of events um as much as you can. So, you know, we're going to get a playable demo here. That's where we want to get to for next week, right? about the whole thing. Just like be able to The main purpose of this is going to be forcing you to build the game so that um if there's some sort of massive problem building it, uh we can confront that and then go from there. So, um, yeah, we we'll just like we did last time, we'll make them buildable apps, put up on Google Drive, and then hand them off so that next week you guys can, you know, sort of play through. And in terms of percentage, like maybe it's like I'll say 70 knowing that most of you get to 50, right? Something like that. So there's a it's a what's that a trailing indicator in terms of you know where if I if I just yank really hard on the chain it'll turn a little bit right something like that make sense because I think most of you have very clear vision of like where this needs to go. It's just sort of you know making the time to do it and we're we're in good shape here. We got three weeksish left so it's coming along.",
    "transcript_segment": "uh input which then you could crank up to make it emissive. So, um the only issue here is you'd want some of them to glow and not other ones like the signpost. So, you want to have control over this. If we edit this, are we gonna have a problem? Uh let's see. So we want to be able to adjust this per material. So up here, these are our inputs on shader graph. Hit plus. I say color and I would label this emissive color. Then select it. Go to settings here. This needs to be a mode HDR so that we can, you know, glow it up. And then, so this is now an input. If you drag it over here, you can connect the input to here. Now, also, I would make its default value something that you could tell if it's working or not. So, white would or whatever. Just something so you can tell it's working. Um, then save this. But let's see if that breaks our decal. Uh, I think I turned the decal off. Wherever this was. Is this it? No, that's a camera. That's a sound. That's something else. Um, let's see. I'll just make a new decal here. And decal. And no, no, no, no, no. It's really critical to spell decal correctly. Okay, there we go. And so now uh if we say new one glow decal, there we go. And Where is this thing? There. There it is. And now if I unfold down here. Yeah, this is the input parameter that we added. And so now, glowy decal. and it didn't seem to break the rest of the decal shader. And so now, yeah, if you want one decal to glow and another one not to glow, just duplicate the material because each material can have its own input setting for the shader. Okay, so the order of events here is add the appropriate input. In our case, it's a color. In order to make it glowy, we need to make sure you switch it to HDR. high dynamic range. Then once you have that configured, drag it into the interface. This represents these inputs. Oh, look at that. They change. I think that's new. Um, and then here you have to route it to wherever you want to go. You know, you could do anything you want between here and here, but we're just simply forwarding this to that input. So, not everybody needs to do that. In that case, that will help Bose's situation quite a bit to work and it won't. So, I tried a bloom effect, a global bloom. Anything I looked online, you know, they said, \"Yeah, you just change it into the the actual colors of it, but yeah, nothing. I tried. I could not get the decals to glow.\" And I saw a bunch of people online that could do that, but yeah, for me, I could not get that to work. But I do like how the button presses activates the glow on the rune and then see as the lid opens, the decals transfer with it. So, >> Oh, okay. So they like more of them show up on the chest, right? Uh as you activate the runes. So that's super cool. Um, the only thing here is that well, now that you got glow, uh, I think perhaps a more obvious, um, way to communicate to the player is either like there's like empty, you know, boxes like where they are or maybe there's like a a very faint version that then, you know, like when it turns on it lights up. So you just, you know, two and be two of them or they overlap or something. Um, so that that's clear. I mean, because I sort of like barely noticed that, but but now that you're able to make them glow, um, the other thing that you could do is when you turn it on is that you could trigger uh a camera at that location and have the camera fly over there real quick so that the player is like obviously sees that this thing is turned on and then it turns off and goes back to the regular control camera. So that you could make that perfectly clear, right? And so that event sequencer is your friend there, right? Like so there's a delay and the camera flies over and then some amount of time after the camera is in place, boom, turns on and you're good to go there. I do like how the button presses, activates the glow on the rune, and then see as the lid opens, the decals transfer with it. So that was pretty cool. Uh, but that's mostly what I worked on over the weekend. And like I said, I probably spent way too much time wasting uh trying to get those to work. But >> yeah, it's really hard. Yeah. And you're you're not alone. I've sunk an uncomfortable amount of time uh especially as you get older. It looks worse. Um in in things that didn't pan out. But um the Yeah, I mean we have a deadline for this at the end of the semester. So, you know, like the for you guys, I would say, you know, ballpark if you're trying some trying to do something for, you know, like two hours, that would feel like the maximum amount of time, you know, I'm not sure what all of your time management strategies are, but like if if you go past that threshold, it should be a Discord post at that point, you know, like and and let us either, you know, try to say like that's a bad idea, stop trying to do it or like here's some else to try, right? I don't I don't want you guys to just pour time into something where you have no no idea, right? In terms of like, does it work like this? I don't know how to test it. I don't know how to, you know, even start to steer myself in the right direction. Right? So, um, that's when you definitely want to reach out. and Bow does it. You know, here's my sign and the boulder that I made. So, the sign is not too big. I made it in respective about, you know, size of my character. The boulders, on the other hand, are a little bit bigger. But we'll zoom. And there's Michelle talking about that. Um, yeah. So, these are the boulders that I made to go around the entrance of the cave into the mineshaft. So they look a lot realistic, you know, from Substance Painter, but you know, it'll change. I'm thinking about changing up the terrain a little bit, but yeah. So kind of did the inside as I was talking about, you know. >> Yeah. So the the inside there, this texture looks a little stretched. The um some of that may be the camera. uh the trip planer shader here in the in this instance because I believe this stuff actually is not on the train. So you should be able to use the separate tripler shader to make sure it doesn't get distorted. >> It all looks like dirt underground. Um the stretching and stuff is a little weird once you get on the mountains and the terrain like once it stretches out, but >> Oh, right. So I guess the sidewalls are the terrain. Uh, so yeah, on the sections where you can I I don't know. I I like the the rock texture a lot better. I might export the rock texture on a plane so that I could use it to paint some of these things, especially for the cave part here. >> You know, I'm thinking about ways to kind of fix that. The rock texture looks really good. >> That's what I did for >> Yeah. Or just put more of those rocks around >> this weekend. And as I said, I'll be out of town for this week. Um, so yeah, I was kind of trying to get everything done and, you know, finished before I left today. Uh, so it's Sunday for me. It'll be Tuesday when you guys watch this. But, oh well, you guys have a great day. Hope you enjoyed. Talk to you later. >> Yeah, it's looking great. And yeah, we we did that deep dive on decals at the beginning. And so, yeah, we're able to make them glow. We're able to access the metallic and ambient occlusion, everything else now. And that all seems to work. So, that all is pretty good news. And yeah, this system here you have going on with like these activating these things to, you know, turn this on. I mean, this symbol seems kind of like from a design purpose like unless you're going to use it again somewhere or like kind of unnecessary. Uh maybe there's just like the blank spots here. again, just trying to lead the player through the through the series of events um as much as you can. So, you know, we're going to get a playable demo here. That's where we want to get to for next week, right? about the whole thing. Just like be able to The main purpose of this is going to be forcing you to build the game so that um if there's some sort of massive problem building it, uh we can confront that and then go from there.

    "search_text": "AVC240 November 26, 2025 Student Feedback: 3D Animation Progress So, um, there's a lot to talk about there. >> That's great. Yeah, you definitely got like everything in place there. Let me hear. >> Uh, I obviously have made a >> I mean, the fence the fence is still too big. A >> lot of progress since the last time. I have camera movement now, so you can really understand the flow of everything. Um, I used a few different techniques in this. One of the big techniques I used was I would render a certain amount of frames without motion blur. And then specifically for shots like this where it would transition to the next shot or zoom in like like here for example when it's zooming in a lot but then also not zooming in. I would I would put on motion blur for the few frames where it would zoom in and then turn it back off so that motion blur was not always on, but it makes those camera movements more, you know, smooth, I guess. Um, I took a few suggestions from what you guys said. Uh, I made this I forget who said what, but I remember someone said this did not this didn't look lively, which makes which is true. It had no lights, so I I added some rainbow like lights going on. Um, I think that >> matches Sorry, I forgot to mute. I think that makes that more interesting. And then obviously I you guys said to just add more like lit buildings everywhere, too. So, I did that and it definitely helps. I played with a lot of depth of field and stuff on some shots. like the start of this one. I made it kind of like blurry at the beginning of it kind to kind of transition from that dream sequence to this. And also I used cryptomat especially for this part. So I I cryptomat him out and then kind of played around with his contrast and saturation. Isn't that right? Oh. Oh my gosh. Oh no. What have I done? Uh, and then I cryptomatted uh this other part of because I think it just kind of matches that idea. I really love Well, and I I composited a lot of this in After Effects in terms of like overlaying this animation over the top so that it t like it is on top of it. Uh, I mean, I I don't really have much to talk about. I just had fun doing this. I didn't I this I I I got to be honest. I was too lazy to make a to make a LeBron jersey that looked good. So, I just found this online and I used it. Please don't please don't hurt me. But, you know, uh yeah, and I just added I actually made this room a little furnished and added textures to everything. Honestly, I'm very happy with it. I'm I don't know. I don't have much more to do really. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. But uh I think that's it. Goodbye. Angie said me. It was me who said it needed lights. Yes, absolutely. They're definitely way more lights. Um yeah. Yeah. I mean, great job. Everything's in place. I mean, has a real vibe to it. Um, is is the hair the Miximo hair or did you >> think >> this is the Miximo hair? >> I can't tell if you're saying that as in it looks really good or it looks >> It looks way better than the Mixmo stuff does usually. I mean, you went back and fixed the alpha channel or whatever at some point. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. on the hair because like the hair usually like the hair texture >> just usually doesn't transfer >> like correctly. >> I did mess with that actually. I think it just kind of looked like that. >> Yeah. Well, I mean some of the Mixmo uh characters are much higher fidelity than others and this one's Yeah. pretty good. Um Yeah. Yeah. It's like a considerable amount of work here. like the getting everything in place. The thing we were talking about before in terms of like is it just going to be unable to be visually parsed because there were so many cuts like no. I think it's you know for a music video like it's readable. I mean, at this point, we've all seen them a bunch of times, so like we kind of know what's coming. But like the for the most part, I think all of that all of that works. um going forward with it. The there's a you know like a few nitpicky things here in terms of the way things are set up. But the the thing I think is going to make it, you know, take take it to the next level where it's like I can see it going in two directions. either um adding some more surreal elements to sort of take advantage of that and make it seem as if it's make it solidly not trying to look realistic, right? in terms of like the setup of the environment, taking advantage of the fact that it's animated or you know how how can we make it look more you know visually interesting than like the you know mix model in this environment like what what is it like if we filmed this for real what other kind of things would be happening in the image here right and so a lot of this stuff could be in comp I mean when when you see a lot of this kind of like nighttime city kind of thing. I mean, in terms of like the environment itself, like you've done a really good job setting things up here with the with the base level, but like just a handful of things to make it start to really seem like a real place, right? So, a couple cars going by, you know, like in the road. Um, I I would like this shot looks looks good. We have this car. Does this car move at all or is it just sit there? Yeah, it just sits there. >> Yeah. So like like it all it's really good as is but in terms of where it could go right there two directions. One, making it embrace its animated identity more or really trying to make all of the environments really sing in this like realistic animation realistic visual style, right? And I think one or or the other, right? Like you have to make a decision there in terms of like let's say you go the hype. Well, yeah, we'll call it the other one like sort of hyper realistic versus um more stylized, right? So, if you want hyper realistic, you know, just really filling out this environment, other things going by, people in the streets, puddles, reflections, you know, random posters, all this stuff, right? you know, like the so that the, you know, like it feels like a shot, but then, you know, taking it to that next level where we're like, \"Oh, this is like a real place, right?\" Um, you know, probably stronger volumetrics maybe coming off of the lights and and that kind of stuff, right? That that hyperrealistic um angle to it. The the other thing for that would be spending some time on the jacket, you know, to really make it look like the right kind of fabric, right? Um, in terms of I mean, has this guy gone into Substance Painter and you could Right. >> Yeah. So, yeah, that would be the next thing, right? So, in Substance Painter, you could do all the things there, right? So, in terms of really dialing in the look and feel of the fabric, right? You know, because it's like it's a cool color and and everything, but like it it still reads as like plasticky, you know, 3D model kind of thing, right? Like that that would be part of that, especially because he's on screen the entire the entire time. Um, you could do a lot to sort of just touch up the face at that point, too. In terms of, uh, you know, making this look possibly less perfect. You could upres some of this. You could swap out some of the textures in terms of like texture bashing there, right? Like in photorealistic lips and eyes and put those on over top, all that kind of stuff. You know what I mean? So, that would be the things I would say. And then for the last part of that hyper realistic route, it would be the um uh the next level of comp, right? In terms of the chromatic distortion, the lens flares, right? Especially nighttime city lens flares. Like, you know, there's a bunch of filmmakers. I mean, the the title credits to Casino is just that. They just pointed a camera at like a handful of lights on the strip and there's all the lens flares and the bokeh and everything there. And so having more of that in the outdoor nighttime scenes, you know, and so all of that would be if you wanted to go the hyperrealistic uh direction. The other direction, right, trying to make it look more stylized. I think because I know you've done other like handdrawn animated things is figuring out how you could maybe put some of that kind of thing in here, right? Where you know like there's outlines. Have you seen the take on me video? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Right. So, not you mean they fully process the entire frame there in that handketched style? Those of you are not familiar who's taking >> aha right where >> right? So it's the entire video has this um hand sketched rotoscoped look to a lot of a lot of the segments. Um, I could see something like this, you know, straight up either in After Effects or either even bringing some of the shots into Photoshop and sort of doing, you know, tracing parts of it, overlaying some things like that kind of stuff. um where you figure out some sort of stylization to sort of take it beyond you know where just go harder in one of those two directions you know what I mean because like it's technically proficient you got everything happening but it's still you know obviously the mixo model in this environment and everything and so like how can you give it a stronger visual identity beyond that right It's so it looks really really good, but you know, like the timing, the pacing, you've got the edit down, but now just trying to think about, you know, how I mean, do you have an inclination there in terms of like making a decision of those two directions which one you would rather go? >> Okay. Well, think about that. I mean, and then I think a lot of it is kind of what we were telling Jack to do earlier, like like this frame or some other frame. Just take a frame into Photoshop or After Effects or wherever you feel more proficient and experiment with like how could I make this frame, you know, really cool in the stylized look and, you know, just experimenting pretty freely there, right? or how could I make it look hyperrealistic, adding some more lens flares, like which of these do I like better? And if you can get to something that you really, really like, then we can reverse engineer like, okay, we've got this really good style frame now, like how would we apply that look in a way that's not crazy to the entire thing? >> You know what I mean? Um, yeah, because here, yeah, we've we've got Yeah, I love the the surreal break here with all this stuff. Um, >> but just really embracing the idea of like, you know, every every frame we could print out and put on the wall, right? And >> what's that? >> Put on a t-shirt. Yeah. Put on a t-shirt, right? And so what, you know, how could we, you know, push these beyond just sort of like, you know, this super well executed 3D stuff in a scene, right? In terms of the the look and feel of the whole thing. I mean, think about it. Either one of those. Um, you know, any other nighttime city movie to look at for inspiration? Taxi Driver comes to mind. Have you seen Taxi Driver? >> Yeah, that was already in my mind. >> Yeah. >> I might add some traffic, too. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, >> there's no traffic lights at that intersection. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. If you want to go the hyperrealistic route, I think finding some reference and then just really getting nitty-gritty like looking at your reference, looking at this, like what is it in my image that's not, you know, totally at that level visually communicating this nighttime cityscape thing I think would be the next thing. But yeah, totally well executed. And then yeah, regardless I think taking the character into Substance Painter so you can I mean you just been sort of like swapping out materials in Blender up till now. Yeah. Yeah. I mean at this point now you can go ahead and Yeah. really experiment with something you know what what how really dial in the entire look there you know because he's on screen the entire time. You know what else could you do to sort of make all that really work? I mean, the front of the jacket obviously needs something there. Like, there should be a button or something. >> Yes. The Mr. Copper jacket, it's the same jacket. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like there should definitely be like buttons there. >> It's just melted to it. >> Yeah. It's like not quite a cardigan, not quite a sport jacket. I'm not sure. It's a It's a different thing. I think you could make that work, but you know, like what what is the next thing? Does it make sense what I'm telling you there? >> Yeah. It's kind of in the middle right now, >> right? >> Push it to one extreme. >> Make it interesting. >> Yeah. I mean, it's like a super super polished previs kind of thing you have going on here, but now like commit to making it this is the this is the work, right? like how which way is it going to go there? Um yeah, because we you're you're ahead of schedule. We got enough time to really think about how to dial that in, right? Um and then that that I think is what the decision you made need to make and experiment, you know, if you have some time this weekend, experiment with that stuff in order to, you know, make the decisions about the other things. Like if you're going the hyperrealistic route, you know, maybe there's other, you know, crap on the fence there and, you know, like what we talked about things here and puddles and like the windows look good, but you know, if you wanted to go that route, doing something to make sure the windows are, you know, different levels of luminance and, you know, the other people and, you know, cars going by and maybe maybe some of the shots have the thing where it looks like there's like water on the lens, you like the nighttime shot, you know, kind of thing. >> Yeah. Um or if you're going the other route where just you're adding more sort of stylized elements, right? A lot of that stuff is probably where it needs to be. You just need to explore how to push the other parts and find, you know, have some more fun with it in compositing and and like what what can you do here? Like you've got a really good base. Like if if the assignment was like now rotoscope this entire thing in your style, right? Like maybe there's not enough time to do the entire thing, but like how could you incorporate, you know, your handdrawn stuff into the into the project there to sort of make it um just give it a much much stronger like artistic identity there, visual visual aesthetic. But yeah, like the the timing and then the the tune you picked, like it all works works great. And then yeah, you've got the skills to make a LeBron shirt. >> I'll keep it. >> I mean, it doesn't look this also doesn't look like lint. It kind of looks like dog food or something. Can you even like >> I think lint probably needs to be like a tiny particle in in um Blender with the hair particle, you know, like there's a hair clump. >> I tried. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Like it just needs to be Yeah. If you want it to look like lint. Yeah. This is my stylized version of >> stylized version of L that looks like dog food. >> Yeah, like the hyperrealistic route, you know, like this. It's probably like some cracks in the wall and stains on the floor, you know, like just that kind of, you know, this door looks way too nice. Um, I mean, really though, he's he's kind of making banks. Look how big this apartment is that he lives. >> Yeah. I mean, if this is New York, this is like >> he's got uh you know, unless he's sharing this space with like four other people, we're looking at like $3,500 a month in rent or something like that. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean, for the brief time I was showing apartments in New York, like people would put up walls. There was a whole company that, you know, came in and put up temporary walls in order to divide your living room into an extra room so you could split the rent uh four ways instead of three ways. >> That was 25 years ago. So, >> I mean, yeah, I love New York City, but it's just sort of like, you know, living there. >> Yeah. Unless you make my my, you know, my talking point used to be like, you know, unless I made $100,000 a year, there's no way I could live in New York City. But now, like the talking point is like, unless I made $500,000 a year, I wouldn't live in New York City. And even then, it's like, I don't know. Could I live in Queens for $500,000 a year? I don't know. >> New York, but it's too expensive. >> Yeah. I mean, you should all You should definitely go if you have the chance even to like couch surf for a while. It's great. I mean, I don't know. I haven't been in the city in a serious way in a long time, but and a lot of the stuff that I really enjoyed is gone. But I mean, as far as I understand, like it's always been like that. Um, but man, yeah, like literally every place I would go to see cool stuff in Manhattan besides like the major cultural institutions like the Met or something like that, they're all closed. Um, which is, you know, I don't know what people in Manhattan are doing, but I'm sure there's probably other places I just don't know about anymore, but it's weird. But great job. Great job. All right. So, go continue being a polymath here. You got your uh animation project. Now, you got to go do your acting. >> I'm a jack of all trades. >> You go play some threeon-ree at the uh park after that. >> LeBron. >> All right. Have a good Thanksgiving. >> All right. here. Wait, I didn't download the other ones. Okay, there's Alec and Gage. Okay, here's Alec.",
    "transcript_segment": "So, um, there's a lot to talk about there. >> That's great. Yeah, you definitely got like everything in place there. Let me hear. >> Uh, I obviously have made a >> I mean, the fence the fence is still too big. A >> lot of progress since the last time. I have camera movement now, so you can really understand the flow of everything. Um, I used a few different techniques in this. One of the big techniques I used was I would render a certain amount of frames without motion blur. And then specifically for shots like this where it would transition to the next shot or zoom in like like here for example when it's zooming in a lot but then also not zooming in. I would I would put on motion blur for the few frames where it would zoom in and then turn it back off so that motion blur was not always on, but it makes those camera movements more, you know, smooth, I guess. Um, I took a few suggestions from what you guys said. Uh, I made this I forget who said what, but I remember someone said this did not this didn't look lively, which makes which is true. It had no lights, so I I added some rainbow like lights going on. Um, I think that >> matches Sorry, I forgot to mute. I think that makes that more interesting. And then obviously I you guys said to just add more like lit buildings everywhere, too. So, I did that and it definitely helps. I played with a lot of depth of field and stuff on some shots. like the start of this one. I made it kind of like blurry at the beginning of it kind to kind of transition from that dream sequence to this. And also I used cryptomat especially for this part. So I I cryptomat him out and then kind of played around with his contrast and saturation. Isn't that right? Oh. Oh my gosh. Oh no. What have I done? Uh, and then I cryptomatted uh this other part of because I think it just kind of matches that idea. I really love Well, and I I composited a lot of this in After Effects in terms of like overlaying this animation over the top so that it t like it is on top of it. Uh, I mean, I I don't really have much to talk about. I just had fun doing this. I didn't I this I I I got to be honest. I was too lazy to make a to make a LeBron jersey that looked good. So, I just found this online and I used it. Please don't please don't hurt me. But, you know, uh yeah, and I just added I actually made this room a little furnished and added textures to everything. Honestly, I'm very happy with it. I'm I don't know. I don't have much more to do really. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. But uh I think that's it. Goodbye. Angie said me. It was me who said it needed lights. Yes, absolutely. They're definitely way more lights. Um yeah. Yeah. I mean, great job. Everything's in place. I mean, has a real vibe to it. Um, is is the hair the Miximo hair or did you >> think >> this is the Miximo hair? >> I can't tell if you're saying that as in it looks really good or it looks >> It looks way better than the Mixmo stuff does usually. I mean, you went back and fixed the alpha channel or whatever at some point. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. on the hair because like the hair usually like the hair texture >> just usually doesn't transfer >> like correctly. >> I did mess with that actually. I think it just kind of looked like that. >> Yeah. Well, I mean some of the Mixmo uh characters are much higher fidelity than others and this one's Yeah. pretty good. Um Yeah. Yeah. It's like a considerable amount of work here. like the getting everything in place. The thing we were talking about before in terms of like is it just going to be unable to be visually parsed because there were so many cuts like no. I think it's you know for a music video like it's readable. I mean, at this point, we've all seen them a bunch of times, so like we kind of know what's coming. But like the for the most part, I think all of that all of that works. um going forward with it. The there's a you know like a few nitpicky things here in terms of the way things are set up. But the the thing I think is going to make it, you know, take take it to the next level where it's like I can see it going in two directions. either um adding some more surreal elements to sort of take advantage of that and make it seem as if it's make it solidly not trying to look realistic, right? in terms of like the setup of the environment, taking advantage of the fact that it's animated or you know how how can we make it look more you know visually interesting than like the you know mix model in this environment like what what is it like if we filmed this for real what other kind of things would be happening in the image here right and so a lot of this stuff could be in comp I mean when when you see a lot of this kind of like nighttime city kind of thing. I mean, in terms of like the environment itself, like you've done a really good job setting things up here with the with the base level, but like just a handful of things to make it start to really seem like a real place, right? So, a couple cars going by, you know, like in the road. Um, I I would like this shot looks looks good. We have this car. Does this car move at all or is it just sit there? Yeah, it just sits there. >> Yeah. So like like it all it's really good as is but in terms of where it could go right there two directions. One, making it embrace its animated identity more or really trying to make all of the environments really sing in this like realistic animation realistic visual style, right? And I think one or or the other, right? Like you have to make a decision there in terms of like let's say you go the hype. Well, yeah, we'll call it the other one like sort of hyper realistic versus um more stylized, right? So, if you want hyper realistic, you know, just really filling out this environment, other things going by, people in the streets, puddles, reflections, you know, random posters, all this stuff, right? you know, like the so that the, you know, like it feels like a shot, but then, you know, taking it to that next level where we're like, \"Oh, this is like a real place, right?\" Um, you know, probably stronger volumetrics maybe coming off of the lights and and that kind of stuff, right? That that hyperrealistic um angle to it. The the other thing for that would be spending some time on the jacket, you know, to really make it look like the right kind of fabric, right? Um, in terms of I mean, has this guy gone into Substance Painter and you could Right. >> Yeah. So, yeah, that would be the next thing, right? So, in Substance Painter, you could do all the things there, right? So, in terms of really dialing in the look and feel of the fabric, right? You know, because it's like it's a cool color and and everything, but like it it still reads as like plasticky, you know, 3D model kind of thing, right? Like that that would be part of that, especially because he's on screen the entire the entire time. Um, you could do a lot to sort of just touch up the face at that point, too. In terms of, uh, you know, making this look possibly less perfect. You could upres some of this. You could swap out some of the textures in terms of like texture bashing there, right? Like in photorealistic lips and eyes and put those on over top, all that kind of stuff. You know what I mean? So, that would be the things I would say. And then for the last part of that hyper realistic route, it would be the um uh the next level of comp, right? In terms of the chromatic distortion, the lens flares, right? Especially nighttime city lens flares. Like, you know, there's a bunch of filmmakers. I mean, the the title credits to Casino is just that. They just pointed a camera at like a handful of lights on the strip and there's all the lens flares and the bokeh and everything there. And so having more of that in the outdoor nighttime scenes, you know, and so all of that would be if you wanted to go the hyperrealistic uh direction. The other direction, right, trying to make it look more stylized. I think because I know you've done other like handdrawn animated things is figuring out how you could maybe put some of that kind of thing in here, right? Where you know like there's outlines. Have you seen the take on me video? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Right. So, not you mean they fully process the entire frame there in that handketched style? Those of you are not familiar who's taking >> aha right where >> right? So it's the entire video has this um hand sketched rotoscoped look to a lot of a lot of the segments. Um, I could see something like this, you know, straight up either in After Effects or either even bringing some of the shots into Photoshop and sort of doing, you know, tracing parts of it, overlaying some things like that kind of stuff. um where you figure out some sort of stylization to sort of take it beyond you know where just go harder in one of those two directions you know what I mean because like it's technically proficient you got everything happening but it's still you know obviously the mixo model in this environment and everything and so like how can you give it a stronger visual identity beyond that right It's so it looks really really good, but you know, like the timing, the pacing, you've got the edit down, but now just trying to think about, you know, how I mean, do you have an inclination there in terms of like making a decision of those two directions which one you would rather go? >> Okay. Well, think about that. I mean, and then I think a lot of it is kind of what we were telling Jack to do earlier, like like this frame or some other frame. Just take a frame into Photoshop or After Effects or wherever you feel more proficient and experiment with like how could I make this frame, you know, really cool in the stylized look and, you know, just experimenting pretty freely there, right? or how could I make it look hyperrealistic, adding some more lens flares, like which of these do I like better? And if you can get to something that you really, really like, then we can reverse engineer like, okay, we've got this really good style frame now, like how would we apply that look in a way that's not crazy to the entire thing? >> You know what I mean? Um, yeah, because here, yeah, we've we've got Yeah, I love the the surreal break here with all this stuff. Um, >> but just really embracing the idea of like, you know, every every frame we could print out and put on the wall, right? And >> what's that? >> Put on a t-shirt. Yeah. Put on a t-shirt, right? And so what, you know, how could we, you know, push these beyond just sort of like, you know, this super well executed 3D stuff in a scene, right? In terms of the the look and feel of the whole thing. I mean, think about it. Either one of those. Um, you know, any other nighttime city movie to look at for inspiration? Taxi Driver comes to mind. Have you seen Taxi Driver? >> Yeah, that was already in my mind. >> Yeah. >> I might add some traffic, too. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, >> there's no traffic lights at that intersection. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. If you want to go the hyperrealistic route, I think finding some reference and then just really getting nitty-gritty like looking at your reference, looking at this, like what is it in my image that's not, you know, totally at that level visually communicating this nighttime cityscape thing I think would be the next thing. But yeah, totally well executed. And then yeah, regardless I think taking the character into Substance Painter so you can I mean you just been sort of like swapping out materials in Blender up till now. Yeah. Yeah. I mean at this point now you can go ahead and Yeah. really experiment with something you know what what how really dial in the entire look there you know because he's on screen the entire time. You know what else could you do to sort of make all that really work? I mean, the front of the jacket obviously needs something there. Like, there should be a button or something. >> Yes. The Mr. Copper jacket, it's the same jacket. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like there should definitely be like buttons there. >> It's just melted to it. >> Yeah. It's like not quite a cardigan, not quite a sport jacket. I'm not sure. It's a It's a different thing. I think you could make that work, but you know, like what what is the next thing? Does it make sense what I'm telling you there? >> Yeah. It's kind of in the middle right now, >> right? >> Push it to one extreme. >> Make it interesting. >> Yeah. I mean, it's like a super super polished previs kind of thing you have going on here, but now like commit to making it this is the this is the work, right? like how which way is it going to go there? Um yeah, because we you're you're ahead of schedule. We got enough time to really think about how to dial that in, right? Um and then that that I think is what the decision you made need to make and experiment, you know, if you have some time this weekend, experiment with that stuff in order to, you know, make the decisions about the other things. Like if you're going the hyperrealistic route, you know, maybe there's other, you know, crap on the fence there and, you know, like what we talked about things here and puddles and like the windows look good, but you know, if you wanted to go that route, doing something to make sure the windows are, you know, different levels of luminance and, you know, the other people and, you know, cars going by and maybe maybe some of the shots have the thing where it looks like there's like water on the lens, you like the nighttime shot, you know, kind of thing. >> Yeah. Um or if you're going the other route where just you're adding more sort of stylized elements, right? A lot of that stuff is probably where it needs to be. You just need to explore how to push the other parts and find, you know, have some more fun with it in compositing and and like what what can you do here? Like you've got a really good base. Like if if the assignment was like now rotoscope this entire thing in your style, right? Like maybe there's not enough time to do the entire thing, but like how could you incorporate, you know, your handdrawn stuff into the into the project there to sort of make it um just give it a much much stronger like artistic identity there, visual visual aesthetic. But yeah, like the the timing and then the the tune you picked, like it all works works great. And then yeah, you've got the skills to make a LeBron shirt. >> I'll keep it. >> I mean, it doesn't look this also doesn't look like lint. It kind of looks like dog food or something. Can you even like >> I think lint probably needs to be like a tiny particle in in um Blender with the hair particle, you know, like there's a hair clump. >> I tried. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Like it just needs to be Yeah. If you want it to look like lint. Yeah. This is my stylized version of >> stylized version of L that looks like dog food. >> Yeah, like the hyperrealistic route, you know, like this. It's probably like some cracks in the wall and stains on the floor, you know, like just that kind of, you know, this door looks way too nice. Um, I mean, really though, he's he's kind of making banks. Look how big this apartment is that he lives. >> Yeah. I mean, if this is New York, this is like >> he's got uh you know, unless he's sharing this space with like four other people, we're looking at like $3,500 a month in rent or something like that. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean, for the brief time I was showing apartments in New York, like people would put up walls. There was a whole company that, you know, came in and put up temporary walls in order to divide your living room into an extra room so you could split the rent uh four ways instead of three ways. >> That was 25 years ago. So, >> I mean, yeah, I love New York City, but it's just sort of like, you know, living there. >> Yeah.

I don't know. >> New York, but it's too expensive. >> Yeah. I mean, you should all You should definitely go if you have the chance even to like couch surf for a while. It's great. I mean, I don't know. I haven't been in the city in a serious way in a long time, but and a lot of the stuff that I really enjoyed is gone. But I mean, as far as I understand, like it's always been like that. Um, but man, yeah, like literally every place I would go to see cool stuff in Manhattan besides like the major cultural institutions like the Met or something like that, they're all closed. Um, which is, you know, I don't know what people in Manhattan are doing, but I'm sure there's probably other places I just don't know about anymore, but it's weird. But great job. Great job. All right. So, go continue being a polymath here. You got your uh animation project. Now, you got to go do your acting. >> I'm a jack of all trades. >> You go play some threeon-ree at the uh park after that. >> LeBron. >> All right. Have a good Thanksgiving. >> All right. here.

Alec here and I'm going to present now the new assets I made for this week. >> This is his 200 video. Is that me or did he upload the wrong thing? Here we go. Hello, Alec here. I'm going to present now the update version of my music video. changes I made for this rip was having these particular effects that work with the narrative that these particles are giving life to the bear and that's why he's able to move on the rest of the music video. I probably animate more particles on the rest of the shots, but I was only able to >> like I think it worked great in those first two shots. And yeah, having this magic, you know, thing uh streaking through the other shots, I think is great. And maybe there's opportunity there to see it um you know, be the motivator in the other shots, right? And so, uh, you know, like it brings the bear to life and then maybe, um, it hits the light, which turns the light on. That might be one. And yeah, I think this book really the the opportunity for animation that you're missing here is the book opening, right? The magic streams by the book and then the book opens itself and there's stuff on it. That's not super simple. Although I thought I remembered seeing a book add-on like just recently that had like a like a rigged book template so that you could open and flip pages fairly easily. I'll see if I can find that. uh which would yeah because animating you know animating the book opening on one hand is you know just rotation of part of it but uh depending on what you want to do with the pages it ends up being you know can be a difficult thing to do. Um, so yeah. And then the only other one was like when the magic hits the bear. Yeah, this I guess we do have different speeds here. Um, it's just like like the geometry of the sphere is really really obvious. I don't know if there's a way to make that a little bit less a little bit less regular or something. But yeah, I mean this is really working to um give it a lot more a lot more visual energy, which is great um on the rest of the shots, but I was only able to do it for this one and the last one. So other change I made, I add this texture to the bear. Yeah, I think that that's a big improvement. To my eye, I feel like it's just a touch too big of a weave still. Jack, what do you think? >> Maybe >> like like just a little bit less space between the weave there on it would for for as big as the bear is in the room. Seems like it should be a a little bit tighter, but that works really well to, you know, definitely take the bear to the next level. >> I still working on the hair particles work in the with the bear model. It I'm struggling a bit to from that. And then I also made this scene shorter. And so here um yeah the the part the magics um goes through and then there's an opportunity here for this thing to like pop up and blink or something you know like hey whatever this thing is is there a speaker I have no idea uh you know but you know like that like it brings that to life as well. um made the light change from twilight to night and then also make this lamp turn on as you can see. And then I made this other shot last longer so we don't see the change in depth of field from the bird to the book. But I still think I probably have to we'll have to move the boot a little bit to the >> Yeah, I think so. And if we see the magic coming across and then turning the light on, >> right? So we don't see it clear. >> And then yeah, that shot is still striking me as like just in general underexposed. And so brighter whatever you're doing out here, whether this is an image on a plane or something like the strength of the moonlight, some more volutric moonlight, stronger edge light here on the bear, that's going to make this because, you know, the brightest thing in the scene is like the bed. And I think what we want to have is like the bare silhouette really clearly defined by the in the >> and I made this other shot last longer so we don't see the change in depth of field from the bird to the book. But I still think I probably have to we'll have to move the boot a little bit to the right so we don't see it clear. And yeah, the only other thing I had was this explosion of particle here at the end. I still need to work on compositing and processing. But this is everything I was able to complete this. >> Yeah. Yeah. This is coming along. This is a big big step forward. I think I, you know, I like where you're going with the shot again. Like I think it just needs to not be so round on the edge of the particle explosion. And then yeah, we need more foreground, you know, a directional light that's giving us more definition on the face of the bear here, right? Even though he's going to be primarily back lit, like we need some, you know, like a a larger area light coming in this direction to give us a little bit more direction. And then maybe some more, you know, glint on the eyes of the bear there. But the bear definitely took a big step forward having that texture. Yeah. I don't know. Do we want the fur on the bear? I think if this weave were just a little bit tighter, like I I would be happy with that and focus on working on working on the magic. Um, and then the only other thing is that I think it's just unnecessary to have that Coco Chanel product postman unless they are giving you money, in which case, you know, take it. But if they're not like like there's just just probably rotate this around um like so that you know we don't see that part. It's just like so prominent. It looks like, you know, if I my pro if the project was like, you know, make a Chanel commercial, like A+, great. But like, you know, like there's um yeah, like there's no just no uh it's distracting, right, from the other stuff where because you know, like wait, is this bear wearing Chanel? Like I don't know. Um so uh yeah, Alicia says we can get sponsors for your project. >> Yeah, the the the standing instructions for the class is that if people want to give you money to do something, you should say yes to that, right? Like absolutely. Um, yeah, if you can get someone to sponsor your project, right? You should be an opportunistic capitalist in that way. For sure. My",

And yeah, the only other thing I had was this explosion of particle here at the end. I still need to work on compositing and processing. But this is everything I was able to complete this. >> Yeah. Yeah. This is coming along. This is a big big step forward. I think I, you know, I like where you're going with the shot again. Like I think it just needs to not be so round on the edge of the particle explosion. And then yeah, we need more foreground, you know, a directional light that's giving us more definition on the face of the bear here, right? Even though he's going to be primarily back lit, like we need some, you know, like a a larger area light coming in this direction to give us a little bit more direction. And then maybe some more, you know, glint on the eyes of the bear there. But the bear definitely took a big step forward having that texture. Yeah. I don't know. Do we want the fur on the bear? I think if this weave were just a little bit tighter, like I I would be happy with that and focus on working on working on the magic. Um, and then the only other thing is that I think it's just unnecessary to have that Coco Chanel product postman unless they are giving you money, in which case, you know, take it. But if they're not like like there's just just probably rotate this around um like so that you know we don't see that part. It's just like so prominent. It looks like, you know, if I my pro if the project was like, you know, make a Chanel commercial, like A+, great. But like, you know, like there's um yeah, like there's no just no uh it's distracting, right, from the other stuff where because you know, like wait, is this bear wearing Chanel? Like I don't know. Um so uh yeah, Alicia says we can get sponsors for your project. >> Yeah, the the the standing instructions for the class is that if people want to give you money to do something, you should say yes to that, right? Like absolutely. Um, yeah, if you can get someone to sponsor your project, right? You should be an opportunistic capitalist in that way. For sure. My"

I feel that changed a lot. >> Pretty much entirely scrapped my last project I was working on. I had a whole different song and scene that I had set up from last week and the week prior. Uh but I was finding myself not enjoying the project. So, I just entirely restarted the other day and now I'm using a a different song and a whole another scene with all new assets. I've changed to a 2.5D kind of thing here. So, in the beginning, we all have these flat asset images that opens up into a 3D space that I still have some placeholder um assets here, but I have some of my finished assets as well that are fully uh fleshed out. And I have half of my camera movements done that I like. I haven't messed with any post-processing yet because I'm not totally done with the music video. This is just half of it that I've almost fully fleshed out here. And as for problems, I don't think I've ran into any problems yet. >> Yeah. Okay. I mean, you got to be into it to spend as much time on what we're doing. And so, yeah, I would say you changed at just the right time. Any later and then it's like, uh, do we have enough time to do the thing? Um, yeah, in terms of like the, you know, 2D 2.5D stuff on stage, this and this works really well. Uh, this seems like it's from a different project, right? just too low res. It looks like a low bit rate kind of thing. Whereas this I think reads as like you know cardboard cutout like literally on cardboard kind of thing. Um so but starting it like this um I think is a cool idea and having that stuff get out of the way. Uh, and then the curtain reveals the operating room that's happening here. That's all uh great, especially when we have some motion blur here of the camera pushing in. I just think you need to Yeah, I mean, I think these are probably placeholder assets anyway. But um yeah, these could either be the actual curtain model in Blender. I don't know if it might be I don't think it might be too tough to make that. Let's give it a two second try here. If we look at it from the top, we made a new curve. Okay. Delete. And then we scribbled some stuff like that. And then we extruded that stuff. There we go. Um, now to get the next level of wrinkle, like a little bit of cloth sim, but we need to make sure there's enough subdivisions. So, there's plenty in this direction. In fact, I might turn that down just a little bit. But now we need some subdivisions in the other direction, which is going to be Do we get a slider for that? No. So, we need to make it a mesh anyway. So, uh convert to mesh. Controlr tab. Control R. There we go. and get him about square like. There we go. Okay, that looks all right. Now we need to pin the top parts. So tab back out physics cloth and then yeah pin group. So we need to make a vertex group to pin. So look at it from this side. Select some vertices. In this case, these here on the top. Let's make a vertex group and assign these to the pin group. There we go. And tab back out. And then back here. Back here. Back here. Pin. There we go. And so now that is simulating but doesn't really do anything. Let's see. So now you've got a simulating thing not only for the backdrop part perhaps but then also for the side curtains. If you give yourself a little bit more time to something like that, shift a mesh cube scale g uh collision and then 100. There we go. So now if we hit play and grab this. Can we You should be able to move some of this and then kind of get something that you want and then freeze it, right? And so, uh, yeah, the key is you just got to have enough time to move. You can't move super fast or the thing will kind of just break. U, but if you turn this back, uh, turn this up. Angie, this stuff might be useful for you as well. Well, now that I'm thinking about it, in terms of two, three, there we go. And so, let's do this and grab this and then move the different side. G. And so, let's say that's a position we want. And now we want to have like this for the side curtain. Um, right click and If we duplicate the object. Yeah, that duplicates it back in the first position. What? It's like current state to stop. Ah, I hit the space bar. It's like points to new object or something like that. All right. Well, rather than hunting and pecking for it, like just duplicate this before so you've got like one to use as a starting point over again. But then when you convert this to a mesh, you get a version that's frozen in time that you could then use to art direct however you would want to. And then yeah, like that. The level of mesh I have here is working pretty well for the simulation. Later, you'd probably want to smooth it out um with a subdivision surface. And you see that immediately looks much better now. But that that can when you have your cardboard cutout stuff there, but then that looking pretty good. I think also some like spotlights maybe moving around there, like stage spotlights uh in that opening scene. And then yeah, I feel like you're getting the vibe of the surgery room there. I would probably look for a gurnie asset, right? Because making that is going to be uh a big time consuming thing, right? In terms of something for the I assume we're going to see someone on that operating table maybe, but yeah, I think you're on the right track there. I mean, the desk in the operating room struck me as strange there, like there's like an office table, but uh you're on the right track there. Yeah. I don't know. I love the track. Should be awesome. Um, cool. All right. And yeah, I would I would worry about you being behind, but like you changed gears and caught up, so yeah, I say you're on a good a good track there. Yeah, this is super cool. I'm not sure if he got where. That's super cool. The only thing that would make it even cooler is like being able to animate them independently so that they kind of came down at different slightly different times. Like that would really that would just be right. And then you know some of these lights are you know giving us lens flares and then there's some stuff here and then I don't know could there be something here like what is it that's there and it kind of gets out of the way before we go in. Cool. You're on the right track there for sure. Yeah. And I like it. Um, yeah. I I mean, I think it's a good shift in tone there. Like, you hadn't given the vampire dance thing like your own feel yet, and I feel like this has more of an identity. We've seen a lot of like vampire raves in media over the last 15 years. I feel like there's a lot I don't know what how much room there's left to really put your stamp on the vampire rave scene at this point. So, plus anytime you're talking vampires, it's just sort of like, all right, well, we're going to have a bunch of like blood stimulations, right? So, that's we got to figure that out, right? Um, yeah, at least it was that way in Sinners. Like lot lot of lot of lot of blood in that one. Um, you know, spoiler alert, but you know, I think it was pretty clear going into it that that was going to be the case. Even if you didn't know it was a vampire movie, I didn't think you, you know, were like, \"Ah, this is probably there's probably not a lot of blood in this movie. Okay.",

I'm working on my music video, but I decided to make things more complicated and add some water. And I made the bubbles that go with the fruits bigger as well. You can see that this is a reflective surface. I've added I've added some panels of light. It's really well well lit except it doesn't seem to want to render in anything but high contrast. And I've I've tried a lot of different things. So maybe Casey can um explain. I've already changed it to low and medium contrast. I've changed the lighting over and over.

This is the surface and things are falling into the water. Is that what we're going for here? Like, is the camera going to be above or below? Let me pull up the Discord here. below below the surface. This video render is the one you're talking about here. That's the previous one. Where are we? Here we are underwater. Okay, now we're definitely underwater. This stuff is falling into the water. Yeah. So, there might need to be two separate setups. One for the shots where the camera is above water. One for the shots where the camera is below the surface. But let's look at the below the surface first. Yeah. I mean, there just needs to be some more time key framing the fruit, right? Like it would fall in like I think you have the general speed of like falling in, but they would all be rotating in different directions. And right now they're all sort of like statically not rotating. Same thing with the watch there. But let's see if we can dial in some sort of look for that in terms of the water. Um, yeah, it's like all reflections, right? And let's try to have some reference here. Okay. So, if we look at some things here, trying to think about what we're actually going for, right? I mean, because it's like, right, is is there a substance that can assume different looks and shapes more than w like water? like not not on Earth, right? So, um you know this what are we actually seeing? Uh when we're underwater looking up at the top, if we have the right angle, we're seeing the reflection of the stuff that's below. So, there's nothing down here. This doesn't show up as anything. And so, a lot of what you're running into here at the beginning is the the gray box situation is that the scenes don't have anything in them. So, same thing here. We're seeing primarily the reflection of this and then you know what what is the other thing we're seeing here? What do you think Jack? >> Exactly. It would be a volume, right? Like like the visibility, right? This is like quote unquote good visibility, right? So a thick volume and then making sure that this is reflecting the stuff down here is sort of I think our main concepts Yeah, even when we're in a pool. Yeah. So, very bloommy. There's the the light reflections. These are called um costics. Um simulating this is uh a render nightmare. Um that is, you know, even when it's good, it's going to take forever. So, faking them is absolutely necessary if that's a big part of it. Um but yeah, seeing this reflect this. And so in order to reflect stuff, we need to actually see stuff. And then some definitely blueish tinted volume is going to be some of the main things here. So let's see what we can do in terms of that because you kept looking at it in this view here when you're talking. And the thing about the material preview mode is that it has an the reason why the water looked better while you were looking at it there is that it has an HDR in it. Like when you go around the scene and you look around like this, there's a default HDR that's in here that is not there in the actual rendered scene and in the certainly not there in the solid view.

So, we need some stuff. Um, in this case, um, I'm going to make a new cube. This needs to be bigger. I don't know, 20 mters. And now we can go inside the cube. Let's take off the top of the cube. Um here and delete that face. Uh we're going to need uh a separate cube for the volume. And so this is going to be uh volume There we go. And as a volume, it needs to get the volume renderer, which is over here. Uh, let's come over. We're going to need this for a while. Let's start looking at it this way. And so over here, this needs to get a new material. Um, we'll call this material water volume just to be sure. And then we'll come in here and we'll just add the simple volume for now. Shift a volume scatter. There we go. And put this in here. Okay, that gives us something. Now, if we come in, uh, now the this is going to be essentially the, you know, like pool or whatever. And this needs to have some stuff in it. Um, and it needs to face the other direction. So, here, let's just get some tiles or something. Okay. And I'm going to turn off the volume for a second. Here we have some tiling at least. Now, uh, let's put the camera here. And so I'll grab the camera and control alt0. There we go. Um, we've got that much now. The So we have a pool have got the volume. Uh, we need to reverse the normals on this so it's facing up on the pool itself. There we go. Um, cool. That's good. Uh, now we need the water. That needs to be a separate thing. Shift A. Um, this needs to be a plane. And scale that way up. Uh, actually that got added to the cube. I'm still in edit mode. Needs to be a separate object. There we go. Plane. Scale it up. Control A. scale. And that's definitely going to need subdivisions for the surface of the water. Turn the volume back on. Okay. And we need a lot of lights here. moving the volume below the surface there like so. and look through the camera and the light. Might need more than one light. Let's put a light on the bottom and light on the top. There we go. All right. So, not getting that weird red anymore. That's good. Uh, where's this other light? Down there. There we go. And so here, this is a bottom light. Let's label it. Let's save this file. Save as here. Pull on. So, this can get much brighter. The volume itself probably needs to have some kind of like blueish tint to it, something. Um, and then this is the water itself that needs to come down and probably also flip. Let's call this water surface. There we go. And now uh I can just flip the normals on this or turn it upside down. It doesn't matter. There we go. And so now it's quote unquote facing down. And so without the volume in here on the pool surface. This needs to be reflective. There we go. Ray tracing actually reflects stuff. So the reflections of the bottom tiles up onto the surface. So that's not nothing. Um, we need some noise on this displacement. Shift a noise texture. And this needs to go to a displacement node. So here to here. There we go. Starts to distort. that to look like some water surface. Let's move the camera up slightly. Position. Yeah. Z. There we go. Going back to this um All right. So now we have stuff that we're reflecting. We've got um now the stuff is giving us some action up here, which is good. We've got this light in the pool. That's pretty necessary. The light above the pool. Yeah, the light is not going to If we make this transparent, does it actually light up anything in there? So, we come back to the water surface and we turned on transmission. Yeah. And not if we're not in cycles, I don't think that's going to actually get us light through the surface. And if we turned on or we turned down the alpha, yeah, it is coming through, but then it just goes away. And so that doesn't really look all that great. Okay, so we've got something there. Now, if we bring our volume back in. Okay, now we're blueish. Uh, if we come back to the volume here, our density can be dialed in. This is too saturated over here. Yeah, the all all the reflective stuff looks way better in cycles, but if you're not handling all the samples. Angie, did you get a chance to watch the thing I linked to from I can't remember whether I did that in I think I did in 185 like the big cycles breakdown where I talked about samples or did I do that in here. I linked to it in the Discord, but I can't quite remember. Um, yeah, I'll post that again. But now with a background, right? Even if we don't want to see this, we could put some other plane in there. So here and here. There we go. And so this can be back and look through the camera. There we go. And so this this is could be the um actual background, but we're still getting action on the uh surface there. Yeah. Uh in Blender, you got to make sure you hit all of the different places to change the samples. If you don't change the samples in both the render and the preview, the preview is the render is still going to take 4,000 samples, which will take the better part of like, I don't know, three years to render your frame, but the background here can now be its own thing. And so, if we made No, not that. Uh, you need a new material. Not that one. New one. And let's say it's blue. Okay, there we go. now with the blue background and you know whatever you want this to be. You can see how that's sort of we're getting the action on the reflections which is what we want there. But uh now let's put a thing in here. Cool. We're even getting this little bit of like halo action on this. Moving down, right? So this is a this is now piece of fruit. >> What's that? >> Oh. Oh yeah. Yeah. Without clicking. Yeah. So you don't click on the volume constantly. >> Yeah. Um yeah, that that is nice. The So this is looking better.",
    "transcript_segment": "that's part of that's the reason this is here, right? so that you can get some sort of judgment for how your materials look so that without having to load in your own HDR. So, we need some stuff. Um, in this case, um, I'm going to make a new cube. This needs to be bigger. I don't know, 20 mters. And now we can go inside the cube. Let's take off the top of the cube. Um here and delete that face. Uh we're going to need uh a separate cube for the volume. And so this is going to be uh volume There we go. And as a volume, it needs to get the volume renderer, which is over here. Uh, let's come over. We're going to need this for a while. Let's start looking at it this way. And so over here, this needs to get a new material. Um, we'll call this material water volume just to be sure. And then we'll come in here and we'll just add the simple volume for now. Shift a volume scatter. There we go. And put this in here. Okay, that gives us something. Now, if we come in, uh, now the this is going to be essentially the, you know, like pool or whatever. And this needs to have some stuff in it. Um, and it needs to face the other direction. So, here, let's just get some tiles or something. Okay. And I'm going to turn off the volume for a second. Here we have some tiling at least. Now, uh, let's put the camera here. And so I'll grab the camera and control alt0. There we go. Um, we've got that much now. The So we have a pool have got the volume. Uh, we need to reverse the normals on this so it's facing up on the pool itself. There we go. Um, cool. That's good. Uh, now we need the water. That needs to be a separate thing. Shift A. Um, this needs to be a plane. And scale that way up. Uh, actually that got added to the cube. I'm still in edit mode. Needs to be a separate object. There we go. Plane. Scale it up. Control A. scale. And that's definitely going to need subdivisions for the surface of the water. Turn the volume back on. Okay. And we need a lot of lights here. moving the volume below the surface there like so. and look through the camera and the light. Might need more than one light. Let's put a light on the bottom and light on the top. There we go. All right. So, not getting that weird red anymore. That's good. Uh, where's this other light? Down there. There we go. And so here, this is a bottom light. Let's label it. Let's save this file. Save as here. Pull on. So, this can get much brighter. The volume itself probably needs to have some kind of like blueish tint to it, something. Um, and then this is the water itself that needs to come down and probably also flip. Let's call this water surface. There we go. And now uh I can just flip the normals on this or turn it upside down. It doesn't matter. There we go. And so now it's quote unquote facing down. And so without the volume in here on the pool surface. This needs to be reflective. There we go. Ray tracing actually reflects stuff. So the reflections of the bottom tiles up onto the surface. So that's not nothing. Um, we need some noise on this displacement. Shift a noise texture. And this needs to go to a displacement node. So here to here. There we go. Starts to distort. that to look like some water surface. Let's move the camera up slightly. Position. Yeah. Z. There we go. Going back to this um All right. So now we have stuff that we're reflecting. We've got um now the stuff is giving us some action up here, which is good. We've got this light in the pool. That's pretty necessary.

The But in order for this to work for the actual animated frames, you're going to need I mean level one is just simply you having different shots come together here on the top. You know, we need some animation on the water surface. So our texture these noise nodes don't have the oh on the vector if we bring this out or actually if we just grab the no noise and say control T. There we go. And so now our location, yeah, that would give us noise uh animation or animation or at least movement on what's happening here with the noise texture. Um let's turn this detail down. There we go. A little bit more. Like that. And so now we should be able to see. There we go. Hold down shift. Okay. So that's part of it. Which one of these is going to actually do the thing? Like is noisy as opposed to shifting the noise? If we moved it on two axes, it just looks like it's moving. There we go. The rotation on the mapping node gives us what looks like actual water movement. Yeah, that's good. That looks like rippling. Yeah. So, we want this to animate. I'm still not totally clear about the scripting part here. Whether we need the pound sign or not. I think we need the pound sign pound sign frame divided by uh I don't know 10. If we hit play, that's way too fast. And so if we divide by a bigger number, it'll slow it down. So let's go 100 and hit play. There we go. And that looks like Ripley pool water happening. Let's save this file. This one's working out. We want more reflection action there on the water surface. And I think a lot of that is going to be what what is at the bottom of the pool is going to change this. But the keys here, you know, this is all the stuff is red because I turned on the face orientation. So the normals are facing in, right? The camera is inside the pool. This has the tiles on it, which gives us some sort of reflection. This is the backdrop to be able to so we don't, you know, we can see the tiles and the the actual thing. Um, in terms of the pool itself, if this if the tiles actually gave off a little bit of light, that might really increase the amount of action in the reflection. So we take this base color and run it into a multiply and then run it into the emission and see is this doing anything? I'm on the pool, right? This is the Yeah. tiles. might need to be some sort of crazy. Oh, I'm multiplying by zero. That always gives you zero, which is no good. Now we've back to zero. And dial it up. There we go. Can look through the camera. Let's see. Is the volume blocking it that much? >> Yeah. Less distance between the pool bottom and the top. Uh let's look at it from here. Let's grab the pool. Uh GZ GZ straight up. There we go. So this is where you get to play the sample game. If you look at the reflections here. So we zero. There we go. Um, you can see the tile starts to make more of a difference there. What if we kept the strength there, but then multiplied here? Let's just make it a value. So, we only have to do one number. I think it's mathematically the same. Um, but it's giving us, you know, stuff that looks like water reflection up there. But then we lost our light that was at the bottom, which is this one. Just need to move that back up into the pool and look through. There we go. Now we're able to see stuff there. Yeah. And you could just determine whether or not you want to see this back there, but it'd be really playing with the material that you put on the pool in order to get different reflections up here. And then the quality of the pool reflections is going to be a function of the ray trace render settings in EV here. And so, um, let's see. So, that's animating, which is great, but the resolution of it, let's see how long it takes on this machine with a bunch of stuff running. So, again, by default, it's one, you know, it's kind of fuzzy up there. If we put it at one to one, that's going to look better, but be slower. And then the next major thing is going to be the rays. Let's see the steps definitely changes the volume there. There with more volume definitely gets the pool looking, you know, murkier. More poolish for sure. Is this one of those things where it's reversed? I thought this was fixed or the other way. So yeah, it's absorbing blue so it looks red. And so I think you may have to do that one of one of those deals because now it's absorbing that much. If we turn this down. Yeah, sometimes the SC some sort of scattering settings are like this where um it's the opposite which I mean makes physics sense but um in terms of like the usability of the program like that's not ideal. But let's see how long it takes to render some frames here. So we'll just uh control F12. So that's happening. I mean on this machine my at full res. It's like under two seconds a frame which is doable but Yeah, dialing in, you know, this and then also the volume. Using a noise in the volume like we did in the past probably helps a little bit",

I mean, did I tint that light in the pool? Maybe that's why I had to tint the other thing. But anyways, this is a totally doable amount of time for for an HD frame here. Um, yeah, like I said, I wouldn't use cycles because it's going to be, you know, you're just going to spend most of your time on render wrangling, but you know, it's got to be GPU. It's got to be experimental so that it uses all the power in the CPU. Max samples. Again, I start at 10. And then you've got to set this one to 10 as well, or else it will just take forever. Uh, and then at 10, it's going to be a noisy mess. And so, it's got to be dnoised in both here. And yeah, the density itself is the which is another reason this is not great for cycles is that, you know, you need the density, I think, to make the the volume to make it work. I put this at zero. Yeah, they got to essentially like relight the scene to make it work. Max samples 10 10. And then make sure you're using GPU on the render. Some of this may not be totally maxed out because uh I may need to restart the computer. But if I just looked at one frame Yeah, this is not doable. So, this is the light that's in the pool. You know, multiple lights will give us our different looks. Definitely a little too green right now, but adjusting the volume here. I didn't duplicate the volume at some point, did I? I don't think so. Did I change this? I don't think I changed it. See, that's weird. Now blue is blue. Before orange was blue. That's strange. The tinting of the lights may also be super useful here. Yeah, I don't know how dense could the volume be. The other thing that could be your friend here certainly is the mist pass, the depth pass, right? And so using that in the comp is gonna if the volume is just destroying the render times, the mispass would get you a similar sort of situation there. Okay. I feel like that's we got close to what's happening here. And again playing with this bottom material some more in order to what if this was much scaled much larger. Let's say 0.1.1 Yeah. So maybe there. And then what if we had more detail or There we go. >> Oh. Oh. I mean the the because because we are animating displacement already, right? But like it would be a separate Yeah. In like more complex water simulation things, there's like a separate we'd add two noises, right? There'd be we'd multiply a big noise that's doing the up and down here by this other one. Um, and then isn't but isn't there a if I come over here You mean now we're getting interesting. Uh, no, it's not wave. It's ocean. Let's get rid of wave. Now we're talking. Uh, and so I'm just scrubbing the time here to make it move. Is this really the like doesn't the current time of the situation? Yeah, you need to animate that. So again, frame divided by 100. Sure. And now >> uh yeah. Yeah. I'm just sort of skipping that step. Now it seems like like it puts it wants the hashtag and then Yeah. And then but when you click on it, it's not there. I'll have to look this up. And so here again, bigger number, slower. I'm just doing this instead of key framing, right? So for something I want to continuously animate throughout the scene, this, you know, I usually do instead of key framing. And so here, maybe a little bit faster. Let's say 25. There we go. Okay. And so the depth and size, these waves are a little big if this is a pool. And so if we bring these in, I mean, we're getting some kind of wild results here, you know, like. There we go. And now the depth needs to come down. How about one meter? That doesn't seem to be one meter. So here I mean angling the camera a little bit so that we're not going to catch the backside of this. Although it won't be red in the render. So there's that. And yeah, crank this super bright light on top that gives you this like halo like that actually. It's super cool. I know in this particular instance, but you know, here's stuff that I I like the way this is looking now. So yeah, there's things to play with there. This just keeps it moving.

But that definitely gives us, you know, now we put some post bloom in the post pro postprocessing then everything I think that could be interesting. HDR, >> right? Well, I mean the the pool is serving as the HDR, right? Like >> I I don't know. Let's try. I don't know. Um, because this is not, you know, quote unquote see-through, I don't know if that's going to matter, but let's try. Uh, if we get it out of here and let's just come back here and yeah, that's slot one. And then we can test it. And so here, let's get some sort of HDR. And okay, come back in here. And that I feel like it is doing. Yeah, definitely contributing to the underwater a little bit. Not huge, but yeah, we don't get we get a little bit more action here. So that definitely helps. And so on the coming over here to the world, um, yeah. Okay, that really fills in the reflection. pretty. Wow. And it even does the thing like on the surface of the water, which I totally didn't think we would be able to pull off here. like that. Really cool. You know, when the camera is like floating. Yeah. So, between the animated noise and the ocean modifier there. The only thing is the costics here. Um, I'd have to think about that if we did an animated gobo on the light that's underneath. Like that would be it. the animated but the doing the animated it be essentially the same animated noise but the animated when we were doing the goos before we did them as actual planes right because that works in cycles and EV whereas the using the light texture if you come over and select one of the lights and you come over here to object I believe you get a space if you say use nodes But then I believe this does not work in EV. Yeah, nothing going there. But there might be an add-on for that EV costics. But regardless, like we got way closer than I would thought we were going to get. Cool. Let's save this one. Um, let's let me save this one. Pack resources. 88 files already. That's a lot. How big this end up being? Oh, that's not huge. Okay. Yeah, I'll um put this on my Google Drive and post it up on Discord, the Blender file. Might be some other people could use that. Awesome. Okay. And so now Here's Alex and Aaron.",

So, right now super. >> Okay, so I'll just go through the changes I made. Um, I got some depth of field going here. Um, I changed the animation a bit. I think this tumble weed is new. Maybe um I added some rim lighting to the horse in these ones. This is essentially the same. Um I changed the set here. Um I like the 2D images in the background, but I definitely need to work on the foreground here a bit still. Um and here I animated the windmill and changed the angle of the camera a bit. And I changed the timing between these two clips. and fix the rays here to be a bit better. This is essentially the same. I just updated the ground to have a bit more detail. Um, I animated the shoes and splashed some dirt on them. >> Yeah, they look appropriately dirty. >> And made this transition a bit faster. And that's everything, or mostly everything hopefully. And here's a still with some of the compositing effects applied. I didn't include them in the video cuz I didn't want to render all that out, but mostly I made the shadows darker and I'll be using that across the video where it's needed. And that's everything. Thank you. >> Yeah, I mean it's looking great for sure. Um, yeah. Where's the bird? Yeah. So, the light rays here, that works out great. And it's kind of doing the job of light wrap, you know, where even an object silhouetted against a super bright light source, it the light source kind of wraps around the edge of it. Um, so you're getting that happening there. I mean, I think the boots I think that's a really the animation I felt worked on the boots. The lights. Yeah, I mean this is still the preview render for lights. Like it feels like Yeah, it's great. It feels way different than the other scene now. And the way the lights look coming in with the depth of field stuff looks really great. Um having them Yeah. really punching the part where they, you know, start to form the bokeh shapes here. So, yeah. Are you using the bokeh blur on um Blender compositing? Because I think that's going to give you more of that. If not the lens blur on After Effects, whichever one. I mean, if you do it later, as long as you render out the depth pass, then you can use the the blur in After Effects. But here, you really wanted that to punch here and then shift a bokeh blur. And here, here, and um yeah, there's a bunch of these. There's nothing in the I think in five they added some things or something but um honestly right it's like just a cube or whatever by default but yeah um over here. Yeah. So the result there is what what's happening optically is it's a artifact that's related to the actual aperture and so the number of fins or I don't know what they're called the the parts that fold in to make the aperture of the camera uh blades probably better um then that is reflected there. These things are kind of a an effect but um in the computer the it's taking it's just taking some sort of simple image and like kind of just stamping it a bunch of times. The algorithm is somehow related to that. Uh that's loosely what's happening. But um yeah, the what if we made something noisier? So some sort of black background. And then here and then musted up a whole bunch. No. I'm just gonna I own all this together. So, I'll flatten it. There we go. Then I'm going to process it. It should process it all together, which is more of what I want. Where are my blur adjustments? I want to get more action on the edge there. There we go. Yeah. Okay. And let's export this. Then we can bring it in over here. There we go. There we go. Right. So, now we're getting all this like tiny detail in there, which Oh, did I crash it again? I'm going to call cause another canvas campuswide power outage. Just cranking stuff in Blender, but it just makes those look way more convincing, right? Not not super. Let's go back to one. Do I have my thing checked? Probably not. You didn't check the thing. Of course, it's not going to work. Everyone knows it doesn't work unless you check the thing. Why can I never find this button up here? Here it is. There we go. There we go. Right. So, just really, you know, gives all this a lot more interest. Uh, and then, you know, you could comp this back in over top. But I mean to making those um you know the you're doing so much with the depth of field blurs which looks awesome and this is going to like take them to the next level there right where you know having some different patterns that are a little bit messed up are going to do a lot you know because that's really what sells these kind of shots you know IRL um is when you like there's interesting action in the bokeh and the technique, you know, in the computer just ends up looking just as always like too clean, right? Um, yeah, cool. And yeah, the bits of animation are great. The spinning of the um windmill I thought looked great. The horse is really great. I just I mean maybe a little bit more here to see the face of the horse a bit like this helps but like just just a tiny bit there I think would help. Um, yeah. I mean, I don't know. See what that what this frame looks like without the horse being outlined because of the, you know, selection or whatever there. But yeah, really great. Super great. And down here.

Um, I don't know what's going Sorry if you hear cars passing, but I'm going to turn this off just in case. Um, some like lines that pass by in the background. I'm trying to figure out what that is. But, um, yeah, I'm trying to I'm going to try to animate better the dance sequence a little bit better right here cuz the way I had it, it felt too um like there was too much going on and it felt kind of rushed. But I've added anim animated more of the dances um and I've given it the stepped interpolation. I might lower it down a little bit for they don't move that slow. Um as well as using the crypto map mode on here um to make her look more pixelated. I'm thinking of maybe changing it just for look a little bit more but not too exaggerated. I'll have to figure it out. And um added more lights here and there. This still has the little well I can't move like that but um has a glare so you can still have like this which I think makes it look a bit more fun. Um just also the little phones have the grease pencil on it and like on the back it has a little heart. There's like motion here too. Um just change some things here and there. Not being too crazy. Um, there's like a slight actual black and I might make it a little bit longer so it doesn't go too fast. Um, it's like an awkward pauser here where you can still see her, but she doesn't move and then she starts. I might try to fix that a little bit more. Not try, I will. Uh, I just had some weird troubles on like here for the lights. I don't know why it's so dark when on the render and everything in Blender it shows it normally. It'll have it like this instead, but um, it's very strange. So I can pull it up real quick. Sorry. Oh, it's the wrong one. Okay, sure. This is a rendered with even the composite. I don't know why it renders so dark. I have I've looked at all my lights and they're all on. So, it's very strange. I have to figure that out. But I also like how it turned out that dark because it really focuses on that. What are we missing there? >> Yeah. Yeah. It's It's like it's not showing this and this at all. In which case my first inclination is normals. Are this in are these backwards for some reason? And because Yeah. like it doesn't look >> composing. I don't know why it renders so dark. >> Yeah, can't do that. Try to drag your window. Um, yeah, I think that's the main thing. Like those might just be off the either. Yeah, because you checked the lights, but did you check the meshes? Those two meshes might be off. >> I have I've looked at all my lights and they're all on. >> Yeah, I can't see there. But >> very strange. I have to figure that out. But I also like how it turned out that dark because it really focuses on that on the phone. But yeah, should be everything. Pretty sure. But thank you. >> Cool. I I mean the vibes are are 100 on here. Like I think the look and feel of it is really coming across and like the pixelated look of the characters with the uh quantized movement I think is really working well. Yeah, I really like Yeah, I have your music off. Um, >> there we go. I turned it down here again. So yeah, I I think this is coming together really well. I mean the main this last camera move where we come down and then the camera stops like I feel like just edit on you know, the camera's there. I would cut to the new shot when the camera stops moving because it just it kind of like cranes down and then stops and then it's there for like a half second, then it cuts to the next shot. I just feel like just cut from the moving shot to the next shot. I think you the the movement of the characters is great, but the I feel like the pace of the editing could be you could cut to some other cameras here like some other dynamic you know angles where we see more of the you know them on the floor. the the floor is working, but you want I think we want to be able to see some kind of shadow on the floor. Like right now, like that's that part of it looks really lowfi in terms of like, you know, like no shadowing here. I feel like we should at least have some kind of shadow on the floor with the lighting. Maybe this is not allowing for it. You said you use the brick on this. Um, if we look over here, that's the other part of it is like that that that fade on the brick texture strikes me as kind of strange. Um, here Yeah. Which thing is it here? Mortar size. Mortar smooth. Yeah, your mortar smooth is too high. I think you know to fit fit with the clean look of the other stuff. Like it just looks kind of strange there. Um, so I would clean turn this down. I think I remember you saying that you did use that on on part of the level there. So yeah, that um trying to work on the light so there's some sort of shadow there. And then the other thing that I think really would take it to the next level is doing some stuff with the phone screen. Making some, you know, low pixel icons that are doing something when we see it here and then when she throws it away later, like that could all be super cool. Um, yeah. And then like just some other just a handful of other things like just if there's is there a bag on here or something, you know, like because it's just like this purple mass right now as opposed to like it doesn't really read is like bench, right? If there just some other stuff on it or if it had some slats or something like that. But then yeah, with the phone I think yeah, there's a really good opportunity for animation. Yeah, because it does. And does does it land face up? Yeah, like having some, you know, pixelated stuff scrolling and everything here like that would all look cool. Um, and then it would 100% read his phone because right now it's a little bit like not totally sure. This is the back. So, but I do think we see the other side there for a little bit. Yeah. And if there's some more cutting during the actual dancing part, I think that would be all right. But you're coming along. Great. But yeah, I think the main part is like you're just missing two parts of the image. They're over there. Cool. That's coming along.",

Um, there's like a slight actual black and I might make it a little bit longer so it doesn't go too fast. Um, it's like an awkward pauser here where you can still see her, but she doesn't move and then she starts. I might try to fix that a little bit more. Not try, I will. Uh, I just had some weird troubles on like here for the lights. I don't know why it's so dark when on the render and everything in Blender it shows it normally. It'll have it like this instead, but um, it's very strange. So I can pull it up real quick. Sorry. Oh, it's the wrong one. Okay, sure. This is a rendered with even the composite. I don't know why it renders so dark. I have I've looked at all my lights and they're all on. So, it's very strange. I have to figure that out. But I also like how it turned out that dark because it really focuses on that. What are we missing there? >> Yeah. Yeah. It's It's like it's not showing this and this at all. In which case my first inclination is normals. Are this in are these backwards for some reason? And because Yeah. like it doesn't look >> composing. I don't know why it renders so dark. >> Yeah, can't do that. Try to drag your window. Um, yeah, I think that's the main thing. Like those might just be off the either. Yeah, because you checked the lights, but did you check the meshes? Those two meshes might be off. >> I have I've looked at all my lights and they're all on. >> Yeah, I can't see there. But >> very strange. I have to figure that out. But I also like how it turned out that dark because it really focuses on that on the phone. But yeah, should be everything. Pretty sure. But thank you. >> Cool. I I mean the vibes are are 100 on here. Like I think the look and feel of it is really coming across and like the pixelated look of the characters with the uh quantized movement I think is really working well. Yeah, I really like Yeah, I have your music off. Um, >> there we go. I turned it down here again. So yeah, I I think this is coming together really well. I mean the main this last camera move where we come down and then the camera stops like I feel like just edit on you know, the camera's there. I would cut to the new shot when the camera stops moving because it just it kind of like cranes down and then stops and then it's there for like a half second, then it cuts to the next shot. I just feel like just cut from the moving shot to the next shot. I think you the the movement of the characters is great, but the I feel like the pace of the editing could be you could cut to some other cameras here like some other dynamic you know angles where we see more of the you know them on the floor. the the floor is working, but you want I think we want to be able to see some kind of shadow on the floor. Like right now, like that's that part of it looks really lowfi in terms of like, you know, like no shadowing here. I feel like we should at least have some kind of shadow on the floor with the lighting. Maybe this is not allowing for it. You said you use the brick on this. Um, if we look over here, that's the other part of it is like that that that fade on the brick texture strikes me as kind of strange. Um, here Yeah. Which thing is it here? Mortar size. Mortar smooth. Yeah, your mortar smooth is too high. I think you know to fit fit with the clean look of the other stuff. Like it just looks kind of strange there. Um, so I would clean turn this down. I think I remember you saying that you did use that on on part of the level there. So yeah, that um trying to work on the light so there's some sort of shadow there. And then the other thing that I think really would take it to the next level is doing some stuff with the phone screen. Making some, you know, low pixel icons that are doing something when we see it here and then when she throws it away later, like that could all be super cool. Um, yeah. And then like just some other just a handful of other things like just if there's is there a bag on here or something, you know, like because it's just like this purple mass right now as opposed to like it doesn't really read is like bench, right? If there just some other stuff on it or if it had some slats or something like that. But then yeah, with the phone I think yeah, there's a really good opportunity for animation. Yeah, because it does. And does does it land face up? Yeah, like having some, you know, pixelated stuff scrolling and everything here like that would all look cool. Um, and then it would 100% read his phone because right now it's a little bit like not totally sure. This is the back. So, but I do think we see the other side there for a little bit. Yeah. And if there's some more cutting during the actual dancing part, I think that would be all right. But you're coming along. Great. But yeah, I think the main part is like you're just missing two parts of the image. They're over there. Cool. That's coming along."

Let me open that one cuz I did the same thing for all of the pieces and I also did what you said and I separated them into separate files.

It like genuinely looks like really sick. Um, and it not being in cycles isn't bothering me because it looks really good in Eevee, like you said. Um, the reflections on the or the reflections with the light shining off the >> Okay. The only thing here is like none of the trees are on the ground. I don't think that's intentional. So, probably just move the ground up. And yeah, since we're in the forest here, even with the stylized look, you know, subdivide the floor five or six times, go into the sculpt tools and just make the floor, you know, not a plane, some kind of like more natural uneven >> grs. Yeah, I tried the particles on this and I think it looks a little weird. Um, I don't like them that much. I know you can customize the particles further, but I liked that. Those are like I especially like this one. And for the actual video itself, we have it here. And uh just a warning, since this time I didn't render these, I just screen recorded the camera. It got a little choppy. So, it's not like the best representation of it, but I was just visualizing and putting it together before having to render it. It still has the blank spots because I know the rain rendering is going to be a little difficult for my computer. But here's what we have. >> Okay, so the the other thing to do here is that we have uh 20 computers here that just are sitting here sucking up GCC's electricity, not doing anything. So um yeah, you can use the school's render farm, right? So, if you came in with your Blender files and put one scene on each computer and rendered it out, you would be done in like 10 minutes. Um, and then if you wanted to do something more ambitious, that would also work, right? So, um, so yeah, remember that. I mean, if anybody wants to come in anytime, Monday, Wednesday, that's fine. There's plenty of room to sit and do stuff in here. And then I know Professor Gerber is in here on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but I'm pretty sure he's okay with people being in here as well when you're working. Did you take his class? Were you coming in person when you Yeah. >> Last semester? Yeah. Okay. >> So far. what we have for that. Um, >> yeah. So you you you really got to edit the footage in, you know, where wherever you can have control of timing it to the music because my main concern here is that we haven't seen it sort of lined up with the music here. And so some of the scenes may need to be much longer, I imagine. And you really don't want to stretch them on the timeline. It's just going to end up looking kind of low frame rate. And so you may need to render more frames in Blender, but I don't think you have a good feel for how long the scenes need to be. You've got the right scenes, but um yeah, I mean, whichever if you're more familiar with After Effects or you're more familiar with Premiere, like there you're just going to have way more control and fidelity of be able to line it up with the specific parts. But I think that's my primary concern at this point is like the timing of the Blender scenes is probably you know, 40 frame 60 frames is like barely is is less than three seconds, right? So, that's not long. Um, and the some of the blank spots are easily more than 3 seconds. So, I I think you just need to be able to, you know, increase the amount of time. If if anything, it's a much easier problem to solve if you have more time. rendered out and then you can either, you know, compress things or just cut off the ends of them when you go to put it all together and make then get your edits lined up to the music. That'll work. But the other thing where you don't have enough footage and you need to stretch things or whatever, that is not that's not going to look good. So, that's that's the main the main concern right now. But, yeah, this is coming along. The lighting looks 100% better now with the light actual light in there. The next thing with the volume for the lighting would be the volume and then uh yeah. All right. So, that's coming along great. But I think you really just gota, you know, next week after everyone gets home, maybe come in, render all your stuff out so you've got an idea of what needs to happen with the timing. >> Hey, this with ABC240 and we're taking the previs and the progress we made on the previs as well.

Anyways, this uh passive. Okay, so the floor just sits there. Okay, we got that working. Now, let's get uh a force in here. uh force field force and crank it up. And now it should move that block. Crank it up more. There we go. Now it's moving the block. There we go. And so do that again. There we go. We got force moving block. You have some version of that, right? Um then if we add a sphere and then add particles to it plus. There we go. And now if we run it yeah they're being propelled by the force. But uh the easiest thing I found was go to the particles and in the particle force. Nope. One of these field weights. There we go. And so in the particle, not the you were in the scene. If I cancel this out now, there we go. The force pushes the block but not the particles, right? And maybe, you know, to make it work, maybe there's a little bit of that in there or something. But I don't know. Like the particles the particles have some kind of mass in the system, I believe. Yeah. And so what if there are like 9 kilogram particles? There we go. Why are they so bouncy?

And so how how did you make the particles how did you make the firework explode? >> It's just one of >> Okay. >> And and you gave them like some sort of like really high velocity or something here, right? And so if we were to let's put the mass back to the regular part. And so now we should be able to propel them out more here. Oh, there we go. The normal. So yeah, getting the part like I mean well that that solves the issue I think. Right. So coming into the stuff that the Then there is collision in the room. So they should bounce off the walls and everything. I didn't give the walls themselves. I have like a separate box outside. >> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But there's a there's something there. Yeah. A barrier of some kind. >> So that works. Um it's just like Yeah. Yeah, I think this I mean are are they spheres or what did you end up >> they're objects they're very low quality icospheres. >> Okay. >> Okay. Yeah. So trying to get them to look like fireworks up close. What kind of ridiculous? >> Yeah. Yeah, we just have picture after picture of completely unsafe. Yeah, that guy looks like he knows what he's doing. Yeah. So, the trail which could come from just the motion blur or the shutter speed. >> Um, >> the other shots. Yeah. Um, and then yeah, could you make a volume thick enough that I mean looks correct? Um, uh, here I just put a material on here. Does it go on the actual particles? I need to reference So now, what do those look like with motion blur up Close."

You know, like uh that that's that's a better sense of a trail, you know, because you're even getting the ricochets and stuff than I was expecting. Like that that might work for that. Have it fade out a little bit more would be good. It might be. I don't know if the cryptomat is going to work on a particle system, but being able to isolate them. If the cryptomat works on the particle system, that would be ideal. That way, you could really punch the luminance of it in the in in compositing. If not, uh maybe just doing a second render of just, you know, because the camera, all the cameras are animated, right? So just doing one pass of just, you know, like your own by hand cryptomat, just turn everything off except for the um fireworks, you know, and so that you would just have that that you could comp in over top. That might work. I don't know. Let's see if the cryptomat works on the on this. I don't There's no reason. I I have no idea if it's gonna work. Let's see. Um >> yeah, let's see if we can isolate it. Um because I remember seeing stuff about cryptomats respecting motion blur now, and I believe that was at least in this version. Um, it's definitely in like the new new one, but yeah, we need an object cryptomat. And now back over here. Uh, and here. And if we let's try that first. What does that give us? Oh, right. It can appends that. We don't want the sphere. We just want the cube for right now. Okay. So, it gives us the object, but it's not giving us the motion blur. Um, wait, why is that? The motion blur is there. Remember this being an issue. Let's just look. Uh yeah, in After Effects you could just on that layer add you're probably going to need to use the nice one, the um well try just regular motion. blur. And then if that doesn't work, pixel motion blur. Let's see here. Okay. I mean, I don't know. It seems like there's some Yeah, I mean it the cryptomat works. So I think that goes a long way to giving you what you would want. And then I think a big part of these scenes is going to be these along to really sell it. I think you need the explosion of the light along with the, you know, the actual explosions there, right? So the having the point light >> there's a point light there. Oh, activating like the volume and then yeah I don't know um you know some I mean this is total um icing on the cake, but I mean some sort of noise volume for the smoke. I don't know if you can make it look convincing enough, but you know, if you made a material and got rid of this and There might be something there. If you animate this, you know, kind of quickly. And then also we're able to key frame again. CtrlT. The trick is making the noise move at the same time. That's not it. That's going to look weird. Oh, there we go. A little bit of the distortion at the same time while you're scaling it perhaps. It needs to fade out more on the edges. I don't know if you can Can you use a frenel with the volume? Does that make sense? I'm not sure. And then another multiply. And so this comes in. This probably needs another one of these here. There we go. I don't know if that works. Yeah, I think so. I don't really know exactly what I'm doing, but it's kind of working. Yeah, let me see about that because I know the other thing that they improved especially in five is that now I think Blender takes the regular volumetric um form format which is a VDB. It's the file format that you use to move animated volumes or complex volumes between programs. And so like we did with the particles for the explosions in 200. Same idea except instead of frames, it's steps in a volutric animation. >> Cool. >> Um yeah, that might be volume. >> Yeah. Like drive the volume with it. Yeah. Yeah. They like map to the density. >> You can do that. >> Yeah. >> Everything with motion blur. Okay. There's just some check box we're not checking here to get >> Yeah. Let's see. Yeah. So yeah, open VDB allows you to bring in you know these volumes the and then you know like the the volume the VDB information is multi- layer there's like density information then there's you know also like hotness heat which can be mapped to like color you know with a ramp and so on and so forth and the um density like It's it's voxels, right? It's like Minecraft, but they're, you know, like they're blurry. Uh, but then when you dial them down, gets very um and so something like that. But try, you know, get the I think you definitely need the particles in the light. And then um yeah, I think yeah, the the downside here is that these things are huge. Uh, right. Because it's three threedimensional pixel information. Uh, so do you have any extra fans pointed at your computer to sort of uh prevent it from catching on fire along with Yeah, this might be one where you take the side of the case off to just increase air flow. or there's a great story. Um I I fact checked this at some point, although now I forget the facteing I did where one of one of the early um supercomputers was um like if you put things in liquid they the transfer of heat is is exponentially. But this is why you freeze to death within minutes in 30°ree water but not in 30°ree air, right? because the transfer of heat is much much much more efficient. Um and and so you can do that but obviously you can't submerge your computer because that would uh destroy the you know electrical signals but the um uh I'm trying to remember how this works. like pure plasma meaning like blood plasma is like not conductive if the salts aren't there something along those lines and anyways it's it was a cray supercomputer one of the early supercomputers they figured out if they submerged the entire computer in the equ you know what ended up being the equivalent of human blood then it could cool it would be cool enough to run um but just you know like all of the it should have been setting off everybody's dystopian sci-fi by alerts where it's like, oh yeah, like well computer runs fine as long as you just sub submerge it in human blood. Uh they weren't actually using human blood. It just ended up being like the synthetic equivalent thereof. But like again feels you like the vibes are off on on doing making that decision. So uh I'll try and actually look up this the story. I mean, because it's not quite as bad as I'm making you out to be, but it was definitely like enough that, you know, some some alarm should have gone off. You're like, I don't know, man. Is this the direction we want to go here? Like, it seems >> I didn't even get to that point. >> Like, I feel like my entire life is is is that is me having that reaction to commercials, the news, you know, whatever it is.

Right? Each particle by default is a sprite, but more in particular, it's a billboard. So, this is a regular term beyond Unity, just a sprite that's always oriented towards the camera, so we can never see around it. We'll turn this off for maybe some of the other examples later, but that's the default, right? So, we were able to do this. We're never able to look around it. And so, this billboard always looks at the camera. You know, it's like taking an object and putting the rotation constraint on it and then having the rotation constraint point at the camera. it would be the same kind of thing, but it's happening on a much much faster basis. And then down here, we've talked a little bit about this before. Our main particle settings are up here. Those main ones that are on, there's a whole bunch of optional stuff you can get to later. And then down here, this is all super super important. The renderer in the renderer by default is set to billboard sprite that's always looking at the camera. Um, and it's got the correct m it's got a material. And if we double click that material, we'll see that that material has this uh shader on it. So, universal render pipeline particles unlit. Okay. So, again, lit means it's going to be influenced by the lighting system. So the if you turn off all the lights in the scene, it won't you won't see it. Unlit is just simply going to be more just like a sprite in space. It doesn't you can't make it brighter by shining a light at it. You can't make it darker by putting it in shadow. it it's much more, you know, 2D in its um in the way it's composited into the actual game system here. These words, you need to know these terms, lit and unlit. I would write them down in my notes. These are not particular to particles. You can have lit and unlit shaders of any kind, right? You to put on regular objects. And so a lot of times unlit things end up being either effects or user interface kind of things. The things that you don't want to you don't want the lighting situation to change in a way where the player couldn't see the thing. If it's unlit, um it'll always be visible. Whatever the sprite looks like is what it looks like. Okay. So lit and unlit. These can be depending on how you think about it. It can be kind of like the opposite of what you would think in that you would think the lit would always be bright because it's lit up. It's not the case. Lit means you light it up with the system, the lighting system. Unlit means it's just flat 2D lighting all the time. Uh let's make a new uh material that we can work with here. And we'll call this particle hat. And here um we'll go to universal render pipeline. Okay. So this is the first. Gotcha. There's a separate section for particles. This is the legacy render system particles. Don't select that one. You go to universal render pipeline. Then particles. Then we'll go with lit. There we go. And that's good. We've got this set up.

So, let's make a new file here. 500 by 500. We always work at 72. If you don't have this written down and memorized, you should. Anytime you make anything that's going onto a screen, it's going to be 72 dpi. We want a transparent background. And we'll just call this particle and square pixels. And there we go. Okay, great. And so now anything that you draw in this square can be exported as a PNG, brought into Unity and made into a particle. Okay. Um so for instance um we'll do some kind of of more working towards like a like a stylized fire kind of thing. Um, a couple things here. Do we want color? A lot of times, no. We want to work in grayscale here uh, in many instances because that gives us the flexibility to add color later in the system. If you give this a color and then you try to tint it, that's a formula for not goodlooking stuff, right? Um maybe, you know, in some instances having the sprite have color is fine, but it's definitely a more flexible workflow to work in grayscale here and then put it together. And then also you need to be thinking about the uh blend mode, right? is that we're gonna start doing something here that looks, you know, kind of like uh like a stylized fire kind of thing. And um the blend mode of the particle is going to be additive, so it's going to get brighter. And so we may want to make it not quite as bright here. So for instance here let's layer. Let's get a gray value here. What do we want to do? We want to be a little bit cleaner than that. uh not having it interact with the edge of the frame here is probably a good idea.

And so color over lifetime also gives you fade over lifetime if you want something to fade in and fade out. So what would that look like? That would look like a new one.

The high dynamic range ones happen under the emission. There's also a setting to get them to show up in the other uh gradient. It may be a project thing.

The c the screen can't get, you know, just gets 100% R, 100% G, 100% B. That's it.

And if we have another one here and another one there, and this one, we bring this down. And so we have, you know, fade in, lives, fades out, dies at the end. Um, and so this gives us a softer on rather than just sort of them popping into existence. And then over here, this allows them to fade out over time. Uh, our mission's cranked up here to the point where we're um overriding some of the color, but we'll keep it for now. The Let's go and get some change in size.

Let's grab the default one here for this. So, we're oozing. This will be we'll call this energy ooze. Um, okay. And let's come in. If we want to make changes to this one, we're going to need a duplicate material. And so, I'll bring this one in here. and we'll say um energy and come back here. Make sure that this one still has the fire. There we go. And so here, this one gets here. So just like anything else you have to have in if you want it to have its own look needs to have its own um system. So here let's look at this. Let's put this back at zero. And here color over lifetime. Why is that color or a lifetime not give us the HDR? Let's see if there's anything here. Yeah. Gosh, there's been a couple times I know I've done that. Unless it's in a new project setting that's now off for some reason. Maybe that's off in HDR or on in HDR by default. All right, we'll work around it. Um, here we go. So, let's just get some some energy in there. Let's get rid of that one for now. Let's give it some kind of color. So, let's say it's going to be like green energy. Oo. Um, here. Let's give it some more juice down here. Usually cranking these um emission settings the whole way over to color looks lame because you're you're violating the like blowout of the camera rule. You know, when a camera blows out, it always blows out to white. And so having it sort of blow out to some other color just makes it look cheesy and not, you know, not the um the way it would if we're actually, you know, blowing out the brightness of the camera. Um yeah. And so our brightness here is going to be the amount that this is like activating the bloom, right? It's not, you know, the monitor only gets so white, but this gives us that. Um, now let's turn it into more of like a stream of stuff. And so, again, they need to live longer. And so, if I start to turn that up, the noise is still making them bounce around. Let's have them fade out. And so here, if we wanted our you wanted to use this for just a fade out, we could get a new one and just sort of reset it. And so I just want white on the bottom. There we go. And then on the top, we'll sort of fade in and fade out. Remember, these are the alpha values here. And again, if we bring the alpha values down the entire time, like so there'll be a balance between this and this. So there, I like that, but I want it I want it this on the edge, but I want it hotter in the core. So we'll make bigger particles. We need more overlap. So we can either come in here under start size and come in and make these larger the top larger the minimum larger. That's giving us more overlap in the middle. That gives us that hotter core, right? And we can get more of them in here with our emission radar time. Where are we at? 90 100. We get our hotter core there. So, let's say that this is going to be",

The best way is to have some sort of like, you know, trigger that you're also animating here on and off. Um, so we ha we have this, right? So we can use this here. We can also use this like for the fire, right? So say if we didn't want it to be continuously just one thing um or kind of swelling and ebbing and flowing under curve here. Here we'll get more and less and more and less over time. If you want the thing to be longer, you have to change that. That's the total amount of time that it goes. So, we got energy ooze. Let's get some sort of um box in here. So, I'll just create a another blank object. I'll take the energy ooze and make it a child. I'll zero this out. Just reset it so it's in the same place. There we go. And so now on here I could add a trigger or I would go with the trigger zone and the box collider. Not that one. There we go. And adjust this so in the Z direction here. So, this trigger zone now is going to be the thing that we could use to talk to the player, right? Come in here. Player reduce uh health when we're stuck in the stuff that's going there. as this is going, you know, on and off the entire time. So, we've got that. If this were moving, right? So, animating back and forth. Let's come back up here and put some oscillation on this. So, the parent game object, I'll put the animate um action transform and let's do it on the position Z or X rather just back and forth. And if we looked at it going, there we go. It's going back and forth. But this is the key thing, other major thing to remember. If the source of the particles is moving, you almost always want it to be in world space, right? So, let's say this moves some more as part of like the obstacle here. Uh, this doesn't update live. So, we'll make it bigger. Kind of like that. And then do that. And so this is going to be something that sprays and the player needs to get by it over here like so. But now it looks exceptionally lame because it's like the once the particles are shot, they're still connected to the thing here, right? And so we have a moving particle emitter. Every time we have a moving particle emitter, it needs to be under um simulation space world. And so now once the particles are shot out, they continue on their own uninfluenced by the by what's going on here. So this could be something that's shooting particles like this. It could also be rotating around, right? And so over here in our if I add another axis of animation over here, let's say rotation X and multiply it by a bunch because we're in degrees. I did it in game. Uh, I didn't save the simulation space world. There we go. Now we're spewing particles everywhere. By the same token, let's say our player gets a power up and then has some energy or something. Um, here I'm going to take this uh energy use and duplicate it out here. And let's move this one. There it is. And I'm not uh under emission. I'm just going to zero this out back to the top. There we go. So it's kind of constant. And make these much much shorter. So 0 and 0.5. There we go. And we want them to emit from our player. So I'm going to take the player here and take energy ooze and put it beneath the player. There we go. And then zero it out like so. Uh not that one. We're going to come up to the transform and reset it. There we go. And so now if our player is moving around here, let's change it back to simulation space world. And if we hit play now, we have that we want the orientation to matter here. So the rotation of this on the Y, we'll put it behind the player like this. So it's like a trail. And so the original orientation here matters. And now when the player's moving, we'll have this particle trail behind. The speed of the player doesn't really communicate high velocity, but the particles do. The other important one here is we have rate over time. There's also rate over distance.

It just maps the distance essentially your velocity onto the rate that the particles are made. So we'll zero this out back to um not a function but just a constant zero. And then over here we'll make And so now if I'm just standing there nothing but then when I start moving right so that mapping is just a result of this and if that's too much 10 and so now when I move. I get a little bit of it. And then the other thing that's happening here is we see like the default particles interacting with the floor. That's one more checkbox in here. It's on the material itself. Soft particles. Yeah. make particles fade out when they get close to intersecting with the surface geometry. And so that gives us this checkbox. We get a thing. And so now that hard line from when you're looking at it a specific angle. And then let's turn this down again. we're not getting that hard line, right? And so like when they intersect with something because they are just planes, right? And so just like when we were drawing this one, I told you not to draw from the edge of the frame. Same same idea here except it's just sort of dynamically doing that as they intersect with the bottom. So that's in the material that soft particle thing. And you know, a lot of the settings here have to do with the speed. And so again, if the start speed were much much lower, let's say one and five now. There we go. And even when we go slow, it's emitting the particles. And rate over distance can also be a curve. And so this, if you wanted it to only do it when you reach high speeds, you can adjust that. So now, just when I'm really really cooking here, should it start to emit the particles? But the once you go to a curve, adjusting this part of the curve is always a little bit wonky because it's a normalized window. So if we want more than 10 If we bring that up, you're sort of adjusting the range that you're looking at versus like the curve itself, right? So, energy trails, dust, this kind of thing, magic sparkles, right? If we wanted these to be magic sparkles, um, we need to get something to look at while we're adjusting them. They're just much much smaller. So start speed one, two, start size 01.1. There we go. So now kind of sparkly again the noise without that they're just sort of like this maybe they live a little bit longer in here start lifetime and again they're in world space and the total amount here right and so there we go we've got something like that when they're smaller like this and it's definitely the fade soft particle the in order to, you know, depending on what the lighting's like, you may need way more juice to the emission to make that work. And so now that's a fun effect. And let's say we wanted more action on the dodge, right? So we have our dodge. Where do we get information on the dodge? The dodge is coming from the input actions, right? And so if you're um not sure how to get to the input actions, it's easier, I think, to just always because we're always going to have a player. So go to the player, go to the player input, and then double click here. This gets you to our actions. The thing I posted on Discord over the weekend, if the sprint is not working correctly, it's changing this from button to value on the sprint. Okay. Um because the the code is working as long as this is a value. A button is just it's like not even a boolean. It's just like a call to a function, right? where it's just like do it now, right? Not not like there's no on to rather to later be off. It's just a now, right? Just a the smallest possible command. Um a value is going to be in this case it's going to be a 01 where it's like we're sprinting and we're not sprinting, right? as opposed to like sprint and then there was no code for you know a separate function that said not sprint because it makes sense to have the sprint because the sprint just multiplies the speed and so it's just saying like multiply don't multiply don't so that needs to be there anyways so the dodge right um again if you hardwire it to a key with the key press thing you won't be able to use the gamepad right which is fine If you want to do that, just make a note so that when everyone's using the game, playing the game, they can know that it's not going to work with the gamepad.

Um a value is going to be in this case it's going to be a 01 where it's like we're sprinting and we're not sprinting, right? as opposed to like sprint and then there was no code for you know a separate function that said not sprint because it makes sense to have the sprint because the sprint just multiplies the speed and so it's just saying like multiply don't multiply don't so that needs to be there anyways so the dodge right um again if you hardwire it to a key with the key press thing you won't be able to use the gamepad right which is fine If you want to do that, just make a note so that when everyone's using the game, playing the game, they can know that it's not going to work with the gamepad.

So, we want we want a a bunch of snow here, right? So, I'm gonna change the shape to a lot of these kind of like areas of influence. I'm going to go to box and make this really big. So 5050 for now. There we go. And yeah, and by default we're going up. So I could either, you know, flip this thing. That's probably the easiest, right? So, if you come in here and just change the um rotation of the particle system, now it's falling down like so. And um we need more snow. What else do we think we need to do for snow here? Yeah, it needs to like move around a little bit, right? Like it's wind. So over here, we'll get our noise. Our default here gives us something that's close. Our strength kind of how noisy it is. Our frequency if this were bigger I think it would be more like bigger gusts of wind or for smaller 0.1 there we go 01 there you go so now you can see it's like kind of getting blown around right so that's a big strength with low 05. All right. More snow drift situation there. Uh, good. Let's get a simple particle here. So, I'll make another new file. Looks all good here. Let's just get some sort of like circle with a cleaner edge. So, I'll get the Where is it? Here. and move this over and Might want a little bit of edge here. So, I'm going to add a little bit of blur. And then in here. And here. Call this snow. Create a new material and snow and universal render pipeline particles lit. Bring in our snow here and make sure that that's going transparent. And put that on our snow. And we can make it a little bit wider. And these can be way smaller. So start size random let's say 0.1 and 2 maybe three. And especially if it's not all that bright out where we don't see the camera in the background or the And we don't see it here either. There we go. Okay. So now for something like this, uh a lot of times the um impetus is to fill the entire with snow and that uh especially if you have a big level is not maybe the best way to go about it. Um, a better approach would be to have like as if you're Charlie Brown being followed by the raincloud here like that. We'll call this the Charlie Brown technique where where the weather follows you around. But, uh, in order for it not to seem, uh, weird, again, you want it the in that they even if you're moving fast, the weather's still there and it's not like moving with you. You want it again in world space. So then then as it moves, it moves with you. And so like the snow would come up here underneath the character. And so now as the character moves around in the game, there would always be snow following it. And you could turn the snow on and off as the as this moved around with the character. We could see it over here. Let's do that. There we go. Right. And even though this thing is flipping around, like the particles are not, right? Because they're in world space. I suppose if you didn't want it rotating like that, although there's, as long as it's in world space, there's no big deal. Another way to go about this is with the um constraint. So if you were to add a component here, constraint, we use this with the decals. So parent constraint and actually uh yeah so if we add this to the character here like so constraint settings activate is active. There we go. That's a little bit less flipping around. although it's not really changing the actual output at all. So I turned off the freeze rotation and so now we're getting a parent where it's just, you know, the position and not the rotation that's being uh filtered down to there. So, so you want the weather just big enough to sort of encompass everything, but not big enough that's going to be um you're trying to you got to crank up the number of particles to like a billion to make it look good for the giant giant level there, right? So, you want want it to follow you around. So, we got snow. Let's make some rain here. So, I'll just uh duplicate the snow. Maybe get rid of the parent for now. Well, no, we'll keep that back here.

Turning it on and off is going to make the rain just like blip. And we want to see start raining and then kind of stop raining in a more elegant way. Uh let's just turn that off. And now there we are. Is it raining? Yes. It shouldn't be raining. Why is it raining? We have looping off duration of five. Yeah. Here it is. There we go. Turn that off. Looping on. Now we should not have rain. We're not raining. There we go. And let's look at our area. So over here, if I Oh, forgot to turn that into a trigger. There we go. Now we'll be able to make it rain. So the numbers are kind of right up against that threshold where it's kind of, you know, heavy and then less so. But now if we step out of it, it stops raining in like a much more naturalistic way as opposed to rain just like t, you know, blipping off, which is what I mean. You could just turn the entire game object on and off, but that's going to look like um like this, right? Where it just blips off, which is not going to be super cool. So, big things. Yeah. Don't try to fill up the entire place with weather. And make sure that um yeah, the one for rain. Trying to think what else would be like this. mainly this switching it to vertical billboard gives us what we want to get it always falling down and not some sort of weird orientation. Now the next level of interest here is spritesheets slash flip books in that your particle could be a movie but not a movie file. just a um one frame one frame that has one we'll say image with all the frames. Okay, so this"

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 25, 2025 Sprite Sheet Animation I closed the window when I was trying to find Here we go. I'll link to this. There's a bunch of good ones here. Um, so that's what's going on here. Let's get um this one. Can use this for some fog or some uh just sort of smokeish kind of stuff. So let's come in here and extract that. Here it is. Right. And so, uh, an 8 by8 64 frames of animation for just this, you know, sort of cloud rising up. Um, and so each this movie is going to loop on each particle, but you need to set it up um, just like everything else. So, let's bring the TGA in here and make a new particle system and set this up. So, there we are. Let's just look at that over here. Here. There we go. Okay. And so now we need a new uh material again universal particles. We'll go lit here. In this case, this one we want this to be go sprite mode. Um, new material. Call this smoke for now. And we'll put this on here. And then we will provide this to the material and you get that. So that's obviously not what we want. We need to do a few things. So here this needs to be transparent. Now we're partway there, right? You can see it. And then in the particle system down here under texture sheet animation where they didn't use the term well they got sheet in there they didn't use the term flip book but when you're looking for different things online people refer to this both ways either flip book animation where everything's on one or spreadsheet and so we need to say yeah we need to do this and so you need to provide the grid size and so in this case it's an 8 by8 right So, you need to look at whatever it is you have there and set it up. Should I zoom in on something? >> Okay. Uh, okay. So, there's that. Let me turn down the velocity of these particles so we can see them, what they're doing. So, zero for now. And we'll move this particle system up. There we go. Now we can see how we're getting somewhere. Okay, that's good. So now we've got something happening. Uh yeah, so 8 by 8. And then there's the issue of what is our default here? Our default is to play the animation over the entire lifetime of the particle. So maybe not. Um, if you want to have more control over how quickly the animation is playing, we can say frames per second, right? Did you see the change there, right? So, here's lifetime. Pretty slow. Here's FPS. And let me just make less particles right now so they're less overlapping. So, how about two? There we go. Now, you can sort of see a little bit better what's going on. Is it or >> this? Yeah, it's it's this value. It's >> I think it's I think it's trying to do this regardless of whatever the game is doing. Um yeah, so because you wouldn't want this to speed up and slow down what the game just like physics and stuff. Um so with that in mind, uh yeah, that's usually pretty good. And so now if you wanted it to, you know, go faster or go slower, we'll keep it at that for now. That gives us something. Now, clearly here for this, like if we wanted it to be like dense, like my house is on fire, smoke, um, this is a good density, but having it pop in and out is obviously really inelegant. So we can solve that with which of our things? Yeah. Color over a lifetime. So if we give ourselves one of these, open this up. And we want the top. Remember the top is the alpha. And so here we want to start at zero and then we want to end at zero. And so now we sort of fade in from one to the other. Still getting kind of blocky interpretation there. That's once again back to our texture settings or no our material settings here. So it's under transparent. Uh so occasionally this doesn't happen a lot but it happens occasionally where I want to be adjusting one thing while something else is still selected. No, let's leave it where it is. Okay, so we got alpha alpha clipping. And so that allows us to expand or contract the alpha mask around the edge of the object. If you eat into it too much, it looks crappy like that. If you don't have it at all, it looks crappy like that. So, uh, where it's just, you know, you can see the squares. And so, kind of having a value there that works, uh, now gives us something to work with. If we were to turn the alpha value down in general, makes them a little bit more see-through. And so now, if I come back to this, um, we can let's make it more of a cloud. So, I'll go from shape from cone to box. Make the box bigger. Let's say 555. There we go. Bring this up. And now we want it to be you want these dust clouds to be bigger. So, under our start size, uh, there we go. Almost always with these kind of things, we want to check that soft particle box which is in the material. Look right there. Yeah. So now see how that that makes a big difference for these. Um, and then yeah, depending on what you would want this to look like, you have some options, right? So, do we want it to look Let's blend this stuff a little bit. Let's get this into the scene view so you can sort of see it. Now, this is more of like a pig pen sort of look, keeping with the peanuts theme. Okay. So down here uh sort mode can matter now. So by distance. There we go. Um that way things aren't sort of like popping in and out as much like it knows the things in front are in front. Right? So that's one way to approach what's happening here. The other thing is like perhaps it doesn't get up to 100% opacity. So there's a little bit more blending. And so here you see that this like can help to sort of make it thinner or thicker. The other major thing here is about the blend mode of the material. So we have a transparent alpha. If we go to additive uh turn that off and Alpha clicking with additive. There we go. If we look at this now, we get this kind of like energy kind of thing. Um, so we have our color. Again, we don't have the HDR there. We just have the HDR here. I'll try and see why that's the case, but it is. And so if this started to get more emission, there we go. So now, but it's way too dense and it's way too bright. The other thing we could do here is instead of adding, we could multiply these to get something darker. If We set it to Yeah. multiply alpha. And now instead of getting bright in the middle, it'll get dark in the middle. And so now more of a smoke kind of thing, especially if they start to raise up a little bit. So for instance over here if they had some sort of speed now between the particle movement and the particle you know like the texture sheet animation right we can get something that works there. Uh so yeah, you can also use this like for haze, right? If we wanted the whole place to look hazy and so it was much a bigger area here under our box. Let's 20 20 20. There we go. Let's not move it as much. So start speed zero. Let's move the box up. Let's make them much bigger. So, start size. Uh, let's get down to the player view. So, if we're down here like this. So, I've grabbed the camera. I don't have a camera controller on. So, just control shift F moves us there. Okay. And so, now we'll see what it's like from that view. Uh, why is this not getting bigger? They should be bigger. I don't have size over lifetime on So depending on how many you're going to have here, right? It's a real balance between how thick does each individual thing get versus how many there are. I mean, keeping this number with a 100, how many do I need here in order to make that work on this end, right? There's less but they're thicker. Can I make that work here in this sort of thing? Okay, that's good. Another example of",

    "search_text": "AVC200 November 25, 2025 Explosion Effects this from here. Um, let's do this one. So now let's extract this one. Let's grab this texture and again And I'm going to go ahead and make a new one. Let's turn this one off for a second. Okay. And then create our new material explosion. And this has got to go here. It's got to be the right kind. Here, here. Here. And now on here our explosion and texture sheet. This is a 5x5 over here. This isn't set to transparent. There we go. And we can see it exploding. So in this case, uh perhaps so that's not doesn't need the light from everything else. Maybe this one goes with universal render pipeline particles unlit. There we go. Um then back to here. So we want these in like a burst time. We'll say a burst here for now. That gives us a bunch. The the visual energy is there. It's not in the speed. And so start speed. So that we just get a bunch happening. And again they it's doing the number of frames over the lifetime. So here under texture sheet we go to um in FPS here may not be the best decision because then it loops, right? And so because this has a beginning and the end, the other one, the smoke was just the texture sheet itself was set up to just loop, right? Whereas this one, it's like explode finish. So we got to go with lifetime here. But how do we make it play faster? Yeah, make lifetime shorter. So lifetime here under random between two constants, let's say 0.5 and one. There we go. Now it's giving us a burst every five seconds, right? Um, in order to just have some more explosions so I can see what I'm doing. I'm just going to make this shorter, but probably this will be something that's triggered, you know, from an event. So, you know, explode now versus just continuous non-stop explosions happening in your game. Um, and so here in the material the material. There we go. If this is additive, uh, let's see. I did change it to um unlit. There we go. So now uh that gives us something we want. Probably not a cone. Let's just go with a sphere. Let's give it random sizes. So start size random between two constants. There we go. So one and five maybe. There we go. And so now we're getting some explosion happening. Um, you have to be careful the it draws in the editor. It draws that box around it, right? And so that may make it look more jittery than it is. The things to do here is sort mode by distance. There we go. Now, we don't get that. This is one of the things with there's so many particles. It's like, how do we composite them all? Do we want the one in front in front? Do we want to add them together? That's one of the major things to deal with every time. Um, there's that. Let's make this explosion better. Let's get particles of junk of stuff happening as well. So, here, um, let's go ahead and make a new thing here. empty. Put this inside of it. There. This is going to be explosion. There we go. Um, now let's move this. Let's reset it so it's in the same place. There we go. Okay, we've got that. Now we want some sparks coming out of this. Um, I'm going to control crl +v it. And then on this one, we want just a regular material. For the time being, I'll use the snow as a placeholder. So here, and uh this doesn't have texture sheet animation. And so if we look at these together, good. And so now we have these particles here. These need to be tiny. And so start size. Let's say 0.1. There we go. And they want to go in all directions. So speed. There we go. Now they blow up. Maybe not quite as much. There we go. Then they want some gravity. So like so. There we go. More. There we go. Now they need to have random lifetimes. So lifetime. Yeah, even less. Like 6 and 0.2. There we go. And this needs some more emissive juice. And this will be explosion sparks. There we go. And then on explosion sparks, we can use the collision. And now the bounce may work for us. So collide with planes. Am I on the right one? I am. Why are you not colliding with planes world? There we go. Um, bounce. How about 0.1? There we go. Right. And here um 200 of them. Okay. And so now if we watch both these things at the same time. What happened to the explosion? It's right here. They shouldn't be interfering with each other. There's that one. The explosion was exploding. We have the explosion thing on there. There we go. So, we're getting both things, right? And yeah, may seem like a lot going on, but like it's, you know, this is a doable amount of stuff where they both get this amount. We want the sparks to be sort mode by distance. Say by depth. So they're actually behind the other one. Then one last thing here perhaps is um explosion sparks thing that we haven't used yet is that the particles themselves can have trails. And so if we were to turn that on on the sparks, you see we get that. The main things here are ratio. How many of the particles get trails? And so it should be none. If it's at one, it's all of them. Let's say three. So only something trails. What is the magenta telling us? No. Yeah. No material yet. Um because it needs to be here, right? So below the material is trail material. And so you need to have something in there. And now some of them get those trails. The trail tra tech tech uh texture scale shadow bias minimum lifetime. You can have them. Yeah. Width over trail. What if that's 0.1? There's one. So if you have a separate thing, a separate uh material for the trails, it gives you a little bit more control over what you're doing there. But now both of them together, we can have fire, you know, explosions with stuff happening. Again, don't look over here too much once we start to have multiple particle systems in terms of like the blending stuff because that's going to happen with the camera view. And so over here that gives us that. So, um trying to think if there's anything else. We've got the trails. these. Oh, the other thing in these cases, let's go ahead. No light here. Even though I turn off the light, there's still light. Why is that? Under rendering lighting, the ambient light is controlled in the environment. The skybox multiplier. If you turn that down, now it's even less light there. And so we would have this happening every so often. I might want more of the meat of the explosion here. Maybe these were a little bit bigger. There we go. Think they need to live a little bit longer now. The other thing all these uh movies are oriented the same way. So start rotation random between two constants 360 random orientation for each of the spreadsheets. So, an explosion like going out in all directions that'll probably help. Again, there's only one sprite sheet, but now we get, you know, like a more dynamic explosion of stuff happening. Um, the under the sparks here lights. So, this gives you like a burst of actual light that you would see. Um again the ratio would be how many lights does it make and again keep this low. So um we have that and you need a light to use as a template. So we'll say point light here. There we go. This one's kind of like that. Turn that off. But then I need to use that here with this. So now if I were to run it, we should get a burst of actual light. Yeah, they're really close to the sparks. So I think makes more sense to put it on the explosion. So here they're kind of moving with the sparks, which is not what we want. And so let's turn that off. Let's go to the actual explosion particles. Turn that on here. Bring these in like so. Maybe 0.5. There we go. Right. So now it's actually emitting light over there. If you wanted to tint the light in some way. There we go. Uh, is that live? I think it's live. No. Oh, use particle color. Let's say no. Yeah, there we go. Now we get more of the thing. I think the floor is just really reflective. So, there's a bunch of stuff here. um on this page, right? Now that you know how to use uh any sort of sprite sheet, right? Um but you know, some of it would be better for different things, right? You have uh maybe stuff coming out of the pipes, right? That kind of thing. Um stuff coming out of the exhaust on top of buildings and smoke stacks. We got ourions of all different kinds. uh fireballs, but this don't make sense for absolutely everybody's style for the game. So, it's something to consider there. The, you know, can you make this work within the style of the game? The other thing I've done in the past is take the TGA into Photoshop like this. And for instance, let's say I wanted to make it look more cell-shadedish, right? And not um the way it looks now. Uh here uh in Photoshop, it's the filter gallery. And one of the ways to sort of vectorize stuff like you do in Um, uh, Illustrator. I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of things you can do here, right? So, you still get the animation, but you could explore doing different things to make it, you know, make the frames themselves look um, even if it's filling in The alpha value should still be there in the filter. We'd have to look. Um, but where is the cutout one? Here. There you go. Right. So, uh, kind of like the photo the vectorzation of stuff that happens in uh you know like uh Illustrator trace um this is like a simplified version of that here but you would still get the animation happening but as a way to make these if your game isn't you know realistic looking or it doesn't quite fit the style of the game you know is there something you could do to process the entire image sequence which is pretty easy in this case because it's all in one frame Then you could save this out, load it back in, so on so forth. Make sense? All right. So, a lot of options there like environmental stuff, effect stuff, explosion stuff. the thing to be really, you know, the number of lights here, keeping that ratio low and only doing that if it makes sense from, you know, like a lighting standpoint there. But yeah, we have a lot of stuff happening. We hooked it up to the dodge. We've got things happening per moving the character around.",
    "transcript_segment": "this from here. Um, let's do this one. So now let's extract this one. Let's grab this texture and again And I'm going to go ahead and make a new one. Let's turn this one off for a second. Okay. And then create our new material explosion. And this has got to go here. It's got to be the right kind. Here, here. Here. And now on here our explosion and texture sheet. This is a 5x5 over here. This isn't set to transparent. There we go. And we can see it exploding. So in this case, uh perhaps so that's not doesn't need the light from everything else. Maybe this one goes with universal render pipeline particles unlit. There we go. Um then back to here. So we want these in like a burst time. We'll say a burst here for now. That gives us a bunch. The the visual energy is there. It's not in the speed. And so start speed.

And so because this has a beginning and the end, the other one, the smoke was just the texture sheet itself was set up to just loop, right? Whereas this one, it's like explode finish. So we got to go with lifetime here. But how do we make it play faster? Yeah, make lifetime shorter. So lifetime here under random between two constants, let's say 0.5 and one. There we go. Now it's giving us a burst every five seconds, right? Um, in order to just have some more explosions so I can see what I'm doing. I'm just going to make this shorter, but probably this will be something that's triggered, you know, from an event. So, you know, explode now versus just continuous non-stop explosions happening in your game. Um, and so here in the material the material. There we go. If this is additive, uh, let's see. I did change it to um unlit. There we go. So now uh that gives us something we want. Probably not a cone. Let's just go with a sphere. Let's give it random sizes. So start size random between two constants. There we go. So one and five maybe. There we go. And so now we're getting some explosion happening. Um, you have to be careful the it draws in the editor. It draws that box around it, right? And so that may make it look more jittery than it is. The things to do here is sort mode by distance. There we go. Now, we don't get that. This is one of the things with there's so many particles. It's like, how do we composite them all? Do we want the one in front in front? Do we want to add them together? That's one of the major things to deal with every time. Um, there's that. Let's make this explosion better. Let's get particles of junk of stuff happening as well. So, here, um, let's go ahead and make a new thing here. empty. Put this inside of it. There. This is going to be explosion. There we go. Um, now let's move this. Let's reset it so it's in the same place. There we go. Okay, we've got that. Now we want some sparks coming out of this. Um, I'm going to control crl +v it. And then on this one, we want just a regular material. For the time being, I'll use the snow as a placeholder. So here, and uh this doesn't have texture sheet animation. And so if we look at these together, good. And so now we have these particles here. These need to be tiny. And so start size. Let's say 0.1. There we go. And they want to go in all directions. So speed. There we go. Now they blow up. Maybe not quite as much. There we go. Then they want some gravity. So like so. There we go. More. There we go. Now they need to have random lifetimes. So lifetime. Yeah, even less. Like 6 and 0.2. There we go. And this needs some more emissive juice. And this will be explosion sparks. There we go. And then on explosion sparks, we can use the collision. And now the bounce may work for us. So collide with planes. Am I on the right one? I am. Why are you not colliding with planes world? There we go. Um, bounce. How about 0.1? There we go. Right. And here um 200 of them. Okay. And so now if we watch both these things at the same time. What happened to the explosion? It's right here. They shouldn't be interfering with each other. There's that one. The explosion was exploding. We have the explosion thing on there. There we go. So, we're getting both things, right? And yeah, may seem like a lot going on, but like it's, you know, this is a doable amount of stuff where they both get this amount. We want the sparks to be sort mode by distance. Say by depth. So they're actually behind the other one. Then one last thing here perhaps is um explosion sparks thing that we haven't used yet is that the particles themselves can have trails. And so if we were to turn that on on the sparks, you see we get that. The main things here are ratio. How many of the particles get trails? And so it should be none. If it's at one, it's all of them. Let's say three. So only something trails. What is the magenta telling us? No. Yeah. No material yet. Um because it needs to be here, right? So below the material is trail material. And so you need to have something in there. And now some of them get those trails. The trail tra tech tech uh texture scale shadow bias minimum lifetime. You can have them. Yeah. Width over trail. What if that's 0.1? There's one. So if you have a separate thing, a separate uh material for the trails, it gives you a little bit more control over what you're doing there. But now both of them together, we can have fire, you know, explosions with stuff happening. Again, don't look over here too much once we start to have multiple particle systems in terms of like the blending stuff because that's going to happen with the camera view. And so over here that gives us that. So, um trying to think if there's anything else. We've got the trails. these. Oh, the other thing in these cases, let's go ahead. No light here. Even though I turn off the light, there's still light. Why is that? Under rendering lighting, the ambient light is controlled in the environment. The skybox multiplier. If you turn that down, now it's even less light there. And so we would have this happening every so often. I might want more of the meat of the explosion here. Maybe these were a little bit bigger. There we go. Think they need to live a little bit longer now. The other thing all these uh movies are oriented the same way. So start rotation random between two constants 360 random orientation for each of the spreadsheets. So, an explosion like going out in all directions that'll probably help. Again, there's only one sprite sheet, but now we get, you know, like a more dynamic explosion of stuff happening. Um, the under the sparks here lights. So, this gives you like a burst of actual light that you would see. Um again the ratio would be how many lights does it make and again keep this low. So um we have that and you need a light to use as a template. So we'll say point light here. There we go. This one's kind of like that. Turn that off. But then I need to use that here with this. So now if I were to run it, we should get a burst of actual light. Yeah, they're really close to the sparks. So I think makes more sense to put it on the explosion. So here they're kind of moving with the sparks, which is not what we want. And so let's turn that off. Let's go to the actual explosion particles. Turn that on here. Bring these in like so. Maybe 0.5. There we go. Right. So now it's actually emitting light over there. If you wanted to tint the light in some way. There we go. Uh, is that live? I think it's live. No. Oh, use particle color. Let's say no. Yeah, there we go. Now we get more of the thing. I think the floor is just really reflective. So, there's a bunch of stuff here. um on this page, right? Now that you know how to use uh any sort of sprite sheet, right? Um but you know, some of it would be better for different things, right? You have uh maybe stuff coming out of the pipes, right? That kind of thing. Um stuff coming out of the exhaust on top of buildings and smoke stacks. We got ourions of all different kinds. uh fireballs, but this don't make sense for absolutely everybody's style for the game. So, it's something to consider there. The, you know, can you make this work within the style of the game? The other thing I've done in the past is take the TGA into Photoshop like this. And for instance, let's say I wanted to make it look more cell-shadedish, right? And not um the way it looks now. Uh here uh in Photoshop, it's the filter gallery. And one of the ways to sort of vectorize stuff like you do in Um, uh, Illustrator. I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of things you can do here, right? So, you still get the animation, but you could explore doing different things to make it, you know, make the frames themselves look um, even if it's filling in The alpha value should still be there in the filter. We'd have to look. Um, but where is the cutout one? Here. There you go. Right. So, uh, kind of like the photo the vectorzation of stuff that happens in uh you know like uh Illustrator trace um this is like a simplified version of that here but you would still get the animation happening but as a way to make these if your game isn't you know realistic looking or it doesn't quite fit the style of the game you know is there something you could do to process the entire image sequence which is pretty easy in this case because it's all in one frame Then you could save this out, load it back in, so on so forth. Make sense? All right. So, a lot of options there like environmental stuff, effect stuff, explosion stuff. the thing to be really, you know, the number of lights here, keeping that ratio low and only doing that if it makes sense from, you know, like a lighting standpoint there. But yeah, we have a lot of stuff happening. We hooked it up to the dodge. We've got things happening per moving the character around."

So that should hopefully work in your favor there in that like the default usually they try to set these default physics values so that like if you build a thing to scale it's roughly is it going to behave roughly like you would because they usually use the size as like a default mass multiplier right? you know, like if you make a big thing, it's like a big thing made of concrete versus like you made a giant, you know, inflatable box or something that's, you know, it's going to have some sort of strange or just unusual mass in physics.

I would get the you know character uh animation you know somewhere around you know like this is roughly what I want for in terms of like how the arms and legs are going to move and everything. Then in order for this because building the chain is has to have this like settling in the other programs like you can pre-run the sim and I I looked I couldn't find the equivalent here if there is a thing um so that you can have it you know like relax and then when you start it's in the relax position doesn't seem to be available so Oh, like back like make it negative. >> Yeah. >> Um, >> let's see. So if I make it like 50 um Yeah, I mean that was good intuition, but like you know I don't know. We just shoved negative time into some sort of physics simulation.

It's like like there's there's funding and resources now for Blender. I mean, but in like the Adobe case, like why is there not just like a whole like warehouse of people like what do you get paid to do? I get paid to use Photoshop every day for eight hours and then tell people what to fix. Like just the basic uh you know like that that would you know it's not like these things are technically crazy. It's just sort of like the resulting system. It's like oh yeah I set this to zero and nothing works. That doesn't seem like desirable behavior. Uh yeah, tails on either end. And then um once you're fairly good there, uh I would come back and I guess explicitly bake the bake button. But I don't know, it seems to be implicitly doing that any every time anyway.

I would get the you know character uh animation you know somewhere around you know like this is roughly what I want for in terms of like how the arms and legs are going to move and everything. Then in order for this because building the chain is has to have this like settling in the other programs like you can pre-run the sim and I I looked I couldn't find the equivalent here if there is a thing um so that you can have it you know like relax and then when you start it's in the relax position doesn't seem to be available so Oh, like back like make it negative. >> Yeah. >> Um, >> let's see. So if I make it like 50 um Yeah, I mean that was good intuition, but like you know I don't know. We just shoved negative time into some sort of physics simulation. So like I don't know, man. >> Yeah, that was my second point. Give yourself tails on either side, right?

Isaac, do you remember us watching your introduction? >> Yeah. >> Okay. All right. Yeah, then I'm pretty sure we're on Janice. and I am pursuing an associate degree in digital media art at GCC. For this class, I am looking forward to learn and improving my skills in using 3D modeling techniques and gaining more knowledge with Blender. I previously had experience with 3D modeling and animation mostly for school assignments and projects. Specifically, from my past work examples, I made a custom 3C scene animation for my ABC 184 class from last year. So the topic I chose for this animation was how to make a Filipino dessert. Halo halo which I will show. Halo halo in Tagalog actually means mix mix because of the various ingredients being used. The most common ingredients to make halo halo are crushed ice, evaporated milk or coconut milk, leche flan, red beans, binipe or flattened toasted rice, ube ice cream, and various fruits like sweet jack fruits and nata de cocoa or coconut gel. This frozen cold dessert is usually served in a tall glass and a tall spoon. Yummy. So, this project was really fun to do and I enjoyed being able to practice manipulating all the images that I drew with the transform properties and being able to create uh different transitions in each scene. The other work that I did is a fan art I've done in Procreate of one of my favorite animated films by Haya Miyazaki, Spirited Away. And it's still a work in progress, so it's not fully finished yet. There are still other details that I wanted to add on, but I am open to any feedback um that can help me to improve. But yeah, that's pretty much it. It was just I was just trying to experiment different brushes and practicing more of my coloring. But other than that, I am excited for this semester and I'm also excited being able to create alongside with you all. Nice to meet you all. Bye. >> Great. Welcome Jana. That's really great. I like your um everyone here has probably gone through this animation, you know, doing some sort of explaining some kind of process. Um, and yeah, there's a Filipino ice cream place right by my house. It's really quite good. I've had hala before. It's good. I never thought about beans in that kind of context, but they're really sweet and they're really good. Here's the other Thomas K.",

Um so DA bure bureaucracy every um every department or every degree really has an instructional council. Um it's just that video games used to fall under four different instructional councils. Art, writing, music, and trying to get all of which have their own work to do. none of which is particularly concerned with video games. And so trying to get any video game centric decisions made by those groups of people, you can see how that would be problematic, right? I'm sure you guys have taken English class and some of your English teachers may be concerned about video games and other others remarkably not concerned about video games. But to have them wrapped up in the video game curriculum decision-m um is not uh the situation has been addressed. So um yeah, that's good. But it literally just started this semester. So um slow accumulation of getting those things done. I have taken other classes that involve Photoshop and creating art. though I don't think any of it was 3D. I have worked with animation.

And so I've got the checker texture and control shift T, you have to have it selected. Control shift T. Control T. Just control T. control T throws up our texture coordinates and mapping here. And so this um this node here allows us to run a vector.

    "search_text": "AVC185 September 22, 2025 UV Space Fundamentals that. Um to get a better idea of this, we can go into the UV editing view up here. And so we'll click on that. And I'm going to switch back to this and save this. And what are we looking at now? Um, we are looking at the same rendered scene over here. In this, we are looking at what's referred to as UV space. Um, so a couple things to take note of here with UV space. UV space is always a square and it's two-dimensional. And so there's X and Y are the most important dimensions here because it's just 2D, right? Just to say there is this the Z. If there is going to be a Z here, it's going to be the idea that we take this XY plane and maybe we layer multiple planes. And so Z would be the equivalent of like stepping from plane to plane. But for right now, let's just assume it's two-dimensional. Um and um this is where we essentially lay all the faces that we have in 3D flat over here. So UV space and that's what we're looking at over here. And if we zoom in, it'll make a little more sense if we have something that we can see here. And so I'm going to grab an image because the checkerboard image is sort of like autogenerated. We can't access it in the same way. So UV checker here you'll see a whole bunch of options in terms of this type of thing. Why? Why all these rainbow colored numbered grids? This is just uh different schemes for taking two-dimensional space and making it easy to identify where you are in that two-dimensional space. And so here, this is great because it's got the coordinates on it. Let's save this one. And I'm going to come back to my shading view and sub in that Actually, and so instead of the checker texture, which is a little bit problematic in this sense, I'm just going to Sub in this checker into here into here. There we go. And you can see we get similar results when we apply this. Right? The advantage here is that when we come back to the UV editing um it now shows up as a option so that we can see it overlaid in UV space right 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 everybody understand what's going on there right over here in the lower lefthand corner x equals 0 y equals 0 over here x = 1 y = 0 x = 1, y = 1, x = 0, y = 1. Right? And so when you divide up space like this and you make the min zero and the max one, this is always referred to as normalized. Okay, this will be come over come up again and again and again in computer graphics and digital signal processing and using computers in general is that you can take any sort of massive range or infantessimal range and take the max and make it equal to one and take the min and make it equal zero and it makes it easier to sort of either compare things, right? Instead of comparing apples to oranges, then you're comparing oranges to oranges or apples to apples or however you want to think about it. Um and in addition to comparing them, you can also run processes on the range knowing where the min and max is, right? So it'll come up again and again. So uh UV",
    "transcript_segment": "that. Um to get a better idea of this, we can go into the UV editing view up here. And so we'll click on that. And I'm going to switch back to this and save this. And what are we looking at now? Um, we are looking at the same rendered scene over here. In this, we are looking at what's referred to as UV space. Um, so a couple things to take note of here with UV space. UV space is always a square and it's two-dimensional. And so there's X and Y are the most important dimensions here because it's just 2D, right? Just to say there is this the Z. If there is going to be a Z here, it's going to be the idea that we take this XY plane and maybe we layer multiple planes. And so Z would be the equivalent of like stepping from plane to plane. But for right now, let's just assume it's two-dimensional. Um and um this is where we essentially lay all the faces that we have in 3D flat over here. So UV space and that's what we're looking at over here. And if we zoom in, it'll make a little more sense if we have something that we can see here. And so I'm going to grab an image because the checkerboard image is sort of like autogenerated. We can't access it in the same way. So UV checker here you'll see a whole bunch of options in terms of this type of thing. Why? Why all these rainbow colored numbered grids? This is just uh different schemes for taking two-dimensional space and making it easy to identify where you are in that two-dimensional space. And so here, this is great because it's got the coordinates on it. Let's save this one. And I'm going to come back to my shading view and sub in that Actually, and so instead of the checker texture, which is a little bit problematic in this sense, I'm just going to Sub in this checker into here into here. There we go. And you can see we get similar results when we apply this. Right? The advantage here is that when we come back to the UV editing um it now shows up as a option so that we can see it overlaid in UV space right 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 everybody understand what's going on there right over here in the lower lefthand corner x equals 0 y equals 0 over here x = 1 y = 0 x = 1, y = 1, x = 0, y = 1.

Now um the two metaphors I like to talk about with you know UV mapping you also the process of creating a UV map you'll hear people refer to as UV unwrapping. And so that's a good metaphor in that it's very, you know, the underlying idea is kind of like wrapping a present. And it's also like wrapping a present in that like what's the easiest kind of present to wrap? Box, right? This is why we put presents in boxes, right? Because it's easy uh to wrap said thing, right? What if you had to wrap like uh you know an action figure not in a box, right? That would be difficult, right? Because it's surface area would be hard to wrap the paper around. Same deal here. Um, the UV uh UV unwrapping is going to be like trying to take all of the faces for this and laying them flat. And so this will result we have to take something that is three-dimensional a cube and essentially remap it to 2D space. We are losing a dimension. Okay. And because this is happening where we go from 3D and 2D there is the reality of distortion. It is unavoidable. There's no uh that's why every time every tutorial you'll watch about UV unwrapping will immediately cover their butts by being like it's really more of an art than a science. Uh because there is a lot of times there's no quoteunquote right answer. There's sort of better solutions depending on what it is that you want to do. But um the the underlying uh issue is that we have this three-dimensional thing and we need to project it into 2D space. Now if the 3D thing like is the plane threedimensional?

    "search_text": "AVC185 September 22, 2025 Distortion in UV Mapping One of the games I noticed >> along when I noticed it's the texture itself is being distorted that the sort of piece to create. >> Yeah. So that's that's like a especially in games where you're trying to be as performant as possible. Um, and doing something like water where you know like that >> you should have know enough now to get the feeling that like god how would I 3D model water you know like that should sound like a complicated complex endeavor uh you know based on what you know already right like making our playground slide is one thing but like could you make some could you make a title wave you know like okay I don't know like no no is the answer right now but Um, and so there's a lot of ways you have to quote unquote cheat or hack in order to do things, especially in games. And so animating UVs like Arlink is talking about. Um, if we look at this, like taking something, let's grab this face, which face is this one. Just a really simple version of this would be distorting what we're seeing there in a very simple way just by animating the coordinates here in UV space rights in this you know some kind of distortion happening here now it would be do something more complex than just like moving the points around but the idea being that you can animate over here in order to create the illusion of something over here. Right. So, um yeah, right. Doing something like water, we could do some um you know, like noise or something in UV space in order to get that to happen. But this all should show the uh underlying situation is that each face in 3D is represented in the 2D space, right? And it's pretty easy to see in the default box layout, right? like the wrapping paper. Um yeah, the other one is like you know taxiderermy like skinning animals, right? That that would be a similar sort of uh endeavor. We have this 3D shape that we need to flatten, right? Uh once you get to unwrapping, you know, characters and stuff, it gets much closer to that than to uh you know, wrapping presents. But here with boxes and stuff, right? Um, the other idea would be like how would I make this out of cardboard, right? Or like fold up paper to make this work. And so that's pretty obvious here, right? Like this one folds up, this one folds up, this one folds up, and then we have fold fold and we could get it into a into a cube in this instance. Does that make sense for everybody there? And so you can see that I can change which squares and what which color that are part of the grid here in um by either moving points or moving entire faces here. Right? So I can uh just like in this edit mode, I can select UV points, UV edges, and UV faces. And so I can grab multiple ones here. And if I press G, you'll see the whole thing updating over there and then yeah like when I get to the top here if I were to do this you're like what how come I'm still seeing stuff when you move it out there it because UV space wraps around right because ideally you don't want to have sections with not it's it's a better default it's a better way for that to to work um the idea that it would just continue to repeat as you moved it right it's part of the idea that's connected to that normalized space and everything outside of normalized space is just sort of a repeat of what's happening inside the normalized space. Um so yeah all of the usual tools are available here. So we can move, rotate and scale uh all these individual components in UV space, right? So I press R, can do this. We can do it on this one so we can see what's happening. And so here we get to much more of a situation like Arlink was talking about where we're definitely seeing some like weird pixel distortion based on the rotation of this um edge, right? Like that. uh some subdivision issues there with what's going on with the cube. If I were to tab out and select the um sphere and tab in, we get a completely different UV map for the sphere here, right? And so this when we're talking about UV unwrapping a sphere, if you've taken geography class or talked about u map projections in history class, right? We're well all all of those same issues um without all of the historical geopolitical baggage uh are at play here, right? Uh whereas, you know, we're going to get distortion along the equator. Is that what we want? because there could be some different ways to approach unwrapping this. And if we were to adjust any of this, if I grab it and just press S, right, we can sort of bring this down. I'm making this smaller, which is sort of covering less pixel area. And if I make it bigger, you can see it's sort of repeating itself in 3D space there. Um, and then tab out, select, tab in, and the plane is pretty easy. You know, it's um just a square here within this space. But if I were to move some of these around, you'll see how that I'm getting distortion in UV space. Whereas the plane itself is still perfectly fine. Right? The 3D space is properly represented here. Whereas over here I can distort that right. So we have this flattening and representing of all of the um faces over here.",

Really, it's like it's the same numbers. What do you want me to do with them? Do you want me to position something in space or do you want me to draw some pixels? because there's this really convenient overlap in that both of those things are just um the computer word here.

I think if we go back and look at the UV editing here, right? Is that we you know red is X, green is Y, right? And so remember our UV space over here. Um we had um 0 0 and then this is one one. And we can see how combining them together gives us this. If we were to grab this here, this face and start to move it around the whole face. So, I'm going to take both of these points here, hit G to grab them. Both of the points need to go to point mode first and start moving them over here. Um, we're moving them further over this way.

So, if we come back over here and analyze the other objects with the same uh knowledge now, right? Um if we look at this how this is laid across in space and so the the um look at the bottom here right this is red here at the bottom like so see that because this polar point here is uh essentially this stuff here at the bottom. And we see that over here it would be black. Over here it would be red. Right? And we see those points sort of like on top of each other there. As it goes across it going around is essentially the equivalent of like traveling this way on the UV space. And so over here, same thing at the top, right? We have the yellow and the green, right? Essentially this corner and this corner, right? which are this corner and this corner. It's just that the way that they're laid out in the 3D space here is different because of the two-dimensional mapping over here.

I'm trying not to distort this. making more sense, right? How we're laying out the space here from one to the other. So let now that we understand this color coding idea, let's see what happens when we look at the raw output. We saw how it changed the checkerboard pattern there. But it may be tough to sort of understand what exactly is happening with the numbers. If we run this in there, we get a much different um set of values. Okay. So now first of all the remember UV space we're getting 2D information the which is why it's red and green. Now we're starting to get this much more rainbow kind of look. Why is that? It's because we now we're getting some Z information. The way that the way that textures are going to be prepared or stretched across the space is going to have to do with three-dimensional information now rather than just two-dimensional information. Right? So now we can see the cube has one corner that's completely blue where you be you could assume it is 001, right? one z, zero x, zero y, which is why we're seeing all blue. Uh, if you look at um some of the other corners, right, there'll be a red corner where x= 1, r equals 1. Uh, and so here we can see we see you know these maxing out across the space are generated here. Let's look at normal. our plane is all blue. um essentially saying that all of this is totally or uh oriented towards normal space whereas here we're getting different values and also this sticks to uh the direction it's facing and so you know the the normal is exact is showing us what direction is that face facing right and so if I were to it's most obvious with the cube. Look how the cube works out here. In fact, let me make a new cube so it's perfectly clear. Shift a cube this up. Apply the one we're working with. There we go. And so the normal texture coordinates essentially show you are going to reveal what direction That face is pointed. We've talked about this before. The faces only have one side, right? There's the outside shell and the inside is not really a thing, right? If you go inside, it's not going to render correctly. And so, look at this. What's going on with this? Right? The top is blue, 100% blue, right? Um because we're using the normal face. And so, locally here, right, this is the top facing one, right? I have this set to local orientation so that you know if I were to change the rotation, this is still pointing in the Z direction of the object and this is blue. Whereas if I were to switch this back to global like it doesn't line up anymore. It's taking the local coordinates, the local space of the object and using the how the relationship of how the faces interact with that. Right? So if I look at this um somehow I messed up the anchor point of all these objects, but you can kind of see it, right? the sphere is more red in its local x direction. You know, because the sphere has these gradations, we see that rainbow colored hue shift. But here, no such thing. This is facing directly in that direction and that is facing directly in that direction. So we get solid blue, solid red, solid green. And if we were to get the other side. Yeah, totally black, right? It's just showing us the negative direction. Now I'm I'm rotating the object, right? And so this is the object space. What if we rotated the object within that orientation? That's what happens when we go into edit mode. And so now if I were to start to do this, you'll see that the faces change color, right? because we're that global the local orientation remains locked. If I tab back out, the axis um is facing the same orientation. It's just now the what are we choking on here? Now the um object is not 100% lined up with that. I'm going to blame After Effects and Media Encoder. It's probably Chrome. I had Unity open, too. Gh. Don't be like me. I learned it by watching you having so many programs open. Okay, that seems smoother. Um, let me delete this and make one more properly aligned cube. Right. So, in the for the cube there, in terms of the normal mapping, I think that makes a lot of sense in terms of what is happening there. There we go. Um, and yeah, this is only one, right? And so we grab this Boom. 100% blue because this one face is facing in the Z direction. Again, if I tab in and grab this face and start to rotate it this way, when I'm in normal texture coordinates, if I rotate it this way, it's facing in the X direction. Now, it's red, right? Because um one zero zero. If I come over this way, 0 0 1. If I go up this way, 0 1 0. Um, so normal texture, the texture coordinates are generated relative to the normal of the face. Um, the UV1 is the one that we started off looking at. object. Let's dump that in there. We have like a refined version of kind of what was happening with the normal there. A little bit more complicated. Let's go to camera. There we go. And so now um I can look around a little bit, but for the most part you'll see I'm going to turn off the studio. Go. We have this set up. If we look through the camera, we can see this isn't quite as obvious as I would hope. Is there another light in here I didn't delete? I don't think so. Um, let's look through the camera. So, we're going to lock our camera to our view. There we go. And we can see that all of this has to do with the Z direction faint p pointed towards the camera. It's why everything looks so blue here, right? Because again Z is that direction pointed towards the camera. Let's get rid of that for now. window. So, this one's interesting. It's interesting from a conceptual standpoint. I'm not exactly sure when you would use this at this point, but what it's doing is it's taking the actual viewport and understanding it as X Y UV space because watch what happens if I turn on the lights again. I'm going to move my view. So, if I move them down here, see how they're getting dark black? If I move them over here, they're getting red because XR equals 1. If I move them up here, they're getting yellow because I'm combining one, one, zero. I move them over here, they're getting green. And so the texture coordinates are being changed based on the position of the 3D objects in the window in the viewport. Again, maybe not useful, but useful in terms of just understanding how this this happens. And reflection is super useful in terms of like actually having a reflection uh around the object and we'll look at how that works. We can take different reflections and sort of fake them, wrap a reflection around an object there. But this idea of taking you know XYZ visualizing it as RGB especially when you start to build these nodal um structures on your own like understanding that um is key to really you know having a deeper understanding of what's what's going on here. Um",
    "transcript_segment": "the mesh. That does not always have to be the case. often it will be, but it's just one option here. It's it's the option we'll use probably 80% of the time, right? But it is just one of the options that's available here, right? So, if we come back over here and analyze the other objects with the same uh knowledge now, right? Um if we look at this how this is laid across in space and so the the um look at the bottom here right this is red here at the bottom like so see that because this polar point here is uh essentially this stuff here at the bottom. And we see that over here it would be black. Over here it would be red. Right? And we see those points sort of like on top of each other there. As it goes across it going around is essentially the equivalent of like traveling this way on the UV space. And so over here, same thing at the top, right? We have the yellow and the green, right? Essentially this corner and this corner, right? which are this corner and this corner. It's just that the way that they're laid out in the 3D space here is different because of the two-dimensional mapping over here. And then over here on this one, let's look at this. we have a much more specific area and it's kind of harder to decipher because uh of the way everything's put together here, right? So here, whatever one this is, we could take this and move it more into the corner, which case we would see on this somewhere Yeah. And so now we have this corner over here. This is where it's black.

Is it making sense? Right? Before it was red over here, right? But now instead of red, it's this image. And when we move over to the red area, instead of reading red, we're reading whatever pixel from the image is located in that two-dimensional space, right?

Let's check out camera. So now what was difficult to tell in just the raw reading of this is a little bit more clear is that the image itself is as it now think of the camera as a projector, right? And that the c like it's it's doing the opposite thing. instead of collecting the photons that come in, it's shooting photons of this texture out. How would they land onto the geometry? And so you can see that the objects themselves sort of move through the projected image, you know, like there's this kind of wrapping that you would get with a projector, but now uh when we're in that texture space, it's use it's projecting it out. So it's clearer to see certainly in this instance. object. And so here when it's not changing and I move it around like this, we've switched from defining taking some sort of world or camera and now using the local matrix or local orientation of the object to generate the coordinates so that now they would be locked to the object. the object animates, they're stuck to the surface, right? Not there's several that will be stuck to the surface. UV will be stuck to the surface, but they'll be stuck in a different spatial relationship, a different uh 3D to UV translation. Whereas the lower ones here are not stuck to the surface. They're dependent on either world position, window position, or camera position. Um, normal is stuck to the surface and generated. Let's look at the sphere here. And again local coordinates. So the y is facing in this direction. Y is getting greater. A3 a4 a5. You see that that area. We never really see the corner over there.

Now let's look at some of the nuts and bolts of like how to address some of the issues here with unwrapping things. So the uh with a cube here like we have this crossshaped uh UV map. That's one option. Uh we can tab. It's like the whole thing. Tab in here. Grab all of the faces. Uh first thing from a technical standpoint, a really important button to check out is this incredibly small button which should be much bigger in the interface right here. And so this links your selections. Okay. Right here. This one. Right. Yeah. UV sync selection. They say sync because they use a link for a different thing. So now if I select a face over here in 3D space, I select it automatically selects the same face in UV space. Okay, in vice vice versa. And so now if I selected in UV space. So this is incredibly important. Uh at first you're like, why isn't this on all the time? It seems like I would pretty much always want to have that. Uh you can't perform certain actions if that button is enabled the way it works right now. So you do need to kind of like manage that in terms of like you yeah it's a good idea to have it on most times but there will be times where you need to undo that um syncing in order to perform certain tasks. Okay. So so there's that that allows me to um link these selections because they are two separate things. Notice even the icons are different. Aren't they different? No, they're not different. I thought for sure they look different. No, I guess they're just hallucinating, right? But there, you know, there's points, edges, and faces totally separate from the UV points, UV edges and UV spaces. Um, great. Okay, so there's that. Let's look at some different options when we wrap this. So just with the cube here, if I hit A for all, right click and um let's look UV unwrap faces. There's a lot of stuff here that can happen automatically. Um we can look at some of these. Let's look at Do I have them all selected? What happened here? What do we see on each side of the cube? The whole image. Right? And so what happened here with this is called cubic projection is that um imagine a projector that's above to the left and in front of the object oriented to the object's axis and it projects the entire image onto that face. When you have something as evenly um divided and uh directly oriented as a cube, you end up with this where we see the entire thing over here. It's hard to tell what happened. What happened is that all six sides of the cube are on top of each other now, right? And so if I were to grab one and scale it down now, it seem I think it's more revealed as to what's happening here, right? Uh in that I just have this one side and if I shrink it down, you can now see how that changes compared to the other ones which are still filling, you know, filling up the entire UV space there. So that's one way to start off here is that they can be overlapping. So UVs can overlap. Usually we do not want that. So most of the time you want to be able to paint on the entire object, right? This is this this all of this what I'm sure seems like overly technical discussion right now. You're like, well, do I really need to know this stuff? Um, this is all necessary to create a UV map that will work and and give you the freedom to like paint the object with materials however you want, right? Because up until now, we could apply materials to different faces, but that's obviously limited, right? Like you can only do you can only go so far there and it's not very far at all. um you would rather like in real life be able to freely and precisely paint across the surface and not be limited by the topology of the object. Right? And establishing a UV map is going to be essentially open the door to allowing you to do that to paint freely across the surface. Um, and yeah, this cubic projection kind of reveals that is that UVs can overlap here, but when they do overlap, you lose the ability to distinctly texture the individual parts of the image. Right now, the entire when it stays in cubic projection, if I were to load some other image, that one Oh, yeah. I wish I would do that. Yeah, it's not gonna do it. We're just gonna stick with this for now. But the yeah we can't individually isolate each one. Whereas opposed to if we select all the faces we tab in a right click UV unwrap um smart UV project unwrap. You see that now it's divided it up so that we have six individual faces and none of them overlap. The downside here um is um we have a bunch of space over here which isn't allocated to any part of the model. Okay. And so this is the first UV principle. Most of the time we don't want the faces overlap. Number one. Number two would be use the max amount of pixel space most of the time without distortion. This uh essentially translates into a phrase you'll hear in that the bigger the face is over here in UV space, the more pixels that get applied to it, the more detail it can have. And this is referred to as its texel density.",

Uh in that I just have this one side and if I shrink it down, you can now see how that changes compared to the other ones which are still filling, you know, filling up the entire UV space there. So that's one way to start off here is that they can be overlapping. So UVs can overlap. Usually we do not want that. So most of the time you want to be able to paint on the entire object, right? This is this this all of this what I'm sure seems like overly technical discussion right now. You're like, well, do I really need to know this stuff? Um, this is all necessary to create a UV map that will work and and give you the freedom to like paint the object with materials however you want, right? Because up until now, we could apply materials to different faces, but that's obviously limited, right? Like you can only do you can only go so far there and it's not very far at all. um you would rather like in real life be able to freely and precisely paint across the surface and not be limited by the topology of the object. Right? And establishing a UV map is going to be essentially open the door to allowing you to do that to paint freely across the surface. Um, and yeah, this cubic projection kind of reveals that is that UVs can overlap here, but when they do overlap, you lose the ability to distinctly texture the individual parts of the image. Right now, the entire when it stays in cubic projection, if I were to load some other image, that one Oh, yeah. I wish I would do that. Yeah, it's not gonna do it. We're just gonna stick with this for now. But the yeah we can't individually isolate each one. Whereas opposed to if we select all the faces we tab in a right click UV unwrap um smart UV project unwrap. You see that now it's divided it up so that we have six individual faces and none of them overlap. The downside here um is um we have a bunch of space over here which isn't allocated to any part of the model. Okay. And so this is the first UV principle. Most of the time we don't want the faces overlap. Number one. Number two would be use the max amount of pixel space most of the time without distortion. This uh essentially translates into a phrase you'll hear in that the bigger the face is over here in UV space, the more pixels that get applied to it, the more detail it can have. And this is referred to as its texel density."

Right? This algorithm right here, smart UV project, essentially is an automatic unwrapper, right? It does a reasonable job in that we don't have any overlapping, which is good. The we have minimal distortion and the faces are proportional, right? Meaning that if it's big here, it's bigger over here, right? that and if it's small here, it's small over here. Proportionality is generally something you want, although not all of the time. Like characters, if you have to put the whole character on one UV map, generally you take the face and enlarge it in UV space so that you can get more detail on the face because you probably don't need the same amount of detail on the forearm, right? You can shrink that down in UV space so that it has you're not wasting pixels on the forearm when the face would be more important if everything is going onto the same UV space, which is not always for a super detailed character. Uh, good. All right. So, how do we go about defining some of this ourselves? Um, let's look at that. And essentially we can grab individual um we can grab edges and we can mark them as a UV seam. Okay. And so we've talked previously about the shading the mark sharp and clear sharp. This functions similarly but you're marking the seam or you're clearing out the seam. And so the seam essentially is the boundary of the UV island. So I'm going to loop cut or not loop cut but loop select around here. Right click and say mark seam. And then I'll grab one going this way through the poles. And I'll say mark seam like that. And in the interface they end up being red. It's dark red orange. Whereas you know when you mark sharp I think it's it's like a blue light blue color. And now if I tab in, press select all of the faces to reuv unwrap this. I can come in here and these top three right here, these are the algorithms that are going to unwrap but respect the seams that I've set. Okay, this is something beginners get confused is that they set a bunch of seams and then they run smart UV project. And that's counterproductive because you smart UV project is a is an algorithm that's going to ignore the seams you set. It's going to set its own seams and then unwrap. Whereas these up here in the top section are going to respect the seams that you set and then unwrap. Okay. And we'll look at this. So we'll do angle based here. And we get this at the beginning here. Especially with some of the simple shapes that we're working on. We're not going to see a big difference I don't think here with these three. Yeah. Right. So um unwrap anglebased conformal and minimal stretch. Let's look at the documentation here real quick. Yeah. So, right here, not super helpful here. And we can see that for our even the object that we were working on fairly the the setting the seams correctly is 98% of the work. Which of those unwrap wraps that you run once you've set the seams? Very minimal. Okay? They're not going to be wildly different. What will be wildly different is running the smart UV project. Right? Because watch what happens. I'll run it right now. Dare me to I'll do it. I'll destroy my own seams. Right. So, smart UV project. I run it and you see it goes back to, you know, what we had mostly before, right? Looks like it this seams influenced it some, but it also sent a bunch of its own seams, right? And something less desirable versus uh coming in here and running angle based like so. And so you see that this essentially, you know, we cut off this top part and set a seam right there, which is ends up being, you know, this and then this one down here, which ends up being the other part over there. So if I select all of the edges, if I go to a right click, clear seam that you know essentially erases all the seams.

So the primitives that when you just shift A and make a new primitive, it comes with automatically comes with a UV uh map here. Okay. Um and so this is what you would expect, right?

Well, here let's let's break it to see how that works. Um, you got to be in polygon mode. A, there we go. So, you see what weird, you know, nonsense it did here. Taking that tube, right? I guess maybe the paper toilet paper tube is a better idea here. like trying to not lay that flat and not have it overlap, right? So, you're taking the top of the tube and trying to smoosh it down, right? And have the bottom doesn't work, right? Like here digitally, it did some weird representation of that. But you look like that's not great, right? That's probably an unusable amount of distortion no matter what it is you're doing. And so, we need to mark a seam along this length somewhere. And so in here we select that one and mark seam. Now select all of the these and run it again. Uh much better. Right now you're able to lay this completely flat. And then we have the top and the bottom. And that makes a lot more sense for this whole thing. Again, we in order to keep things proportional there these things are u that's how much space you leave on the table, right? I mean now here's where the you know it's really more of an art than a science man um comes into play, right? where it's like, well, how how you want the object to look at the end of the process is what you need to think about in terms of guiding your decision-m throughout this because there's things you could get away with with some looks and not other looks, right? And so, say for instance that we didn't need to worry about the seams because maybe it was going to be some sort of repeating pattern and it would be easy to hide said seam. And so, we can put another seam there. And so we could say mark seam then reunwrap everything. Now I get more. These are bigger, right? And so I get better tixel density here and here, but I sacrifice a totally continuous amount of space wrapped around the cylinder. I still get all of this properly mapped, right? There's no overlapping faces here. It's just that there's a seam now, but there's way less wasted space than there was before. Right?

    "search_text": "AVC185 September 22, 2025 Unwrapping Cylindrical Objects going to come over here and essentially at the bottom, uh, well, we don't we won't need a seam there at the bottom because those aren't even filled. And then do these have they probably don't have one on the top. And so, we can probably do these just by alt clicking. And so, where to put the seam? We'll learn different ways that you can cover up the seam in the texture. And so, to some extent, you can always most of the time cover it up. But as a general rule to make things simpler, putting the seams le where you're least likely to w to see them. Right? So when you're doing someone's face, you don't typically put the seam down the middle of their face, right? There's uh we we'll look at this later. It's the back of the face that's usually um where things are cut, right? So like here, right? And so along the back of the head, usually covered by hair or even if it's not, that's uh less visible, right? Um again, this isn't mission critical for our um slide, but it's a good idea to get into that mindset. And so I'm going to pick edge loops that are along the bottom here. I'm doing shift altclick. I've got three or four. Right click and say mark seam. There we go. And so those look pretty good. Let's unwrap those. And so another good shortcut here. Uh I can select some of the faces on each one and then Ctrl L selects all of the faces connected to that face. Right? When I join them once again things were not the faces were not joined together. They're still independent pieces just under that one container. Okay. Which is why pressing control L works here. And we can run the unwrap on just that part. And you see this is the unwrap of all my tubes. Right? So this is this is what you would want to see. The tube gets laid out flat and is cut along its length. These were particularly easy because I didn't put caps on these. You may or may not have done that. If you did put caps on these, then in addition to cutting along the length, you would also want to cut uh I'm sorry, not cut, mark a seam on the end cap here by alt clicking there. I don't need to do that because mine don't have caps there. Okay, let's do these over here. Now, where where did they we're just going to unwrap each of them. So this is going to be a more complicated process. We have to unwrap each part. And then once we're happy with like is this is this part good? And we do that for all the parts. Once we're happy with that, then we need to UV pack all of the parts into this space. And the algorithm does most of that work. But, um, it's a two-step process. You can't pack stuff until you get it all properly unwrapped. Everybody with me there? Okay. So, let's do these other tubes over here. Let's check. Did I put caps on these? Looks like not. So, I'll again grab an inner one there and I'll mark a seam and then grab the other one over here. and mark seam. And let's do that part. So again, grab these. Ctrl L gives me all of those. And then I can right click and say unwrap. I'm just going to use angle base. Like we said, there's very minimal difference here. over here on these. This, I believe, goes the whole way down. Yep. So, we'll mark that seam over here. Mark this seam. And so, this um you should always do a good job modeling. You should just do a good job. Period. Right. But now it's going to matter way more because the when you're going to UV unwrap something, the threshold for quality modeling is raised, right? Unfortunately, you're the person doing both of those jobs here, right? So you in all these instances, you'll have no one to blame but yourself, but there'll be plenty of blame to go around, right? All of the selves can get blamed uh in terms of this. And you know, hopefully we've checked this stuff enough at this point that no one's way out of bounds here, but there's plenty of situations where I've modeled something or parts of something, gone to UV unwrap it, and was faint faced with the un comfortable truth that my modeling was not great. And if I wanted to have some sort of reasonable unwrap of this, I would need to go back and make adjustments. Okay? And there's just no two ways about it. That's always super, you know, it's just the way a lot of this goes. And so, let's grab these here and these here. And then again, Ctrl Lives need all of them. Right click and we can unwrap those. And there we go. Since the two of them next to each other there, laid out nice and nice and nice and flat. Uh, good. And then let's look at what we can do for our cubes here. And so here, um, these are cubes laid out in space. And so we might be able to get away with algorithmic approach to these. Let's see. Um if we grab all all of them or a portion of them and controll L and kind of see what's happening um control L okay what is happening what do you what let's look and see what's happening here if I Look at the cubes with the checker on. What is the checker telling me? >> It's a little squish, but then also what what's happening to each stair? >> Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, they're over overlapping. Okay. So in this case for something like this stair and for objects that you create using the array modifier the automatically generated UVs once you take the array modifier and make it um once you apply it you'll get UVs like this out of the box. This would be usable, okay, in that the constraining factor would be that all of the stairs would get the same pixels applied to each other. In some instances, that could be fine, right? if you wanted to. But if you wanted to put like, you know, paint splatter or spilled Kool-Aid on some of the stairs but not other stairs, that would not be possible given the UV map because the all of them are receiving the exact same pixels there. Does that make sense? Okay. So, in our case, what we're what we're going to work towards here is that we're gonna have a we're going to paint a nice playground and then to get to have some fun with Substance Painter, we're gonna like, you know, graffiti it up and make a, you know, na nasty playground. Um, and so we're going to want to be able to, you know, take our digital spray paint and just go all over the whole thing and have it look like that's what someone did, right? And um, so in that case, we do want to separate these out, but not in that would not be always the case. There may be plenty of situations where it' be totally reasonable to do this. Leaves on a tree are one instance for sure where you know it does not doesn't make a lot of sense to separate all the leaves. In fact, we'll make a plant at some point here coming up. Yeah. It's been weeks now for a while and I just know where >> like you're feeling the floor vibrate. >> No, the table vibrates. It feels like my phone. >> Oh. Oh, >> my phone. >> It's your phone. >> Yeah. >> Oh, okay. Yeah. >> Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, yeah. Okay. So, let's uh separate this out.",

If you did put caps on these, then in addition to cutting along the length, you would also want to cut uh I'm sorry, not cut, mark a seam on the end cap here by alt clicking there. I don't need to do that because mine don't have caps there. Okay, let's do these over here. Now, where where did they we're just going to unwrap each of them. So this is going to be a more complicated process. We have to unwrap each part. And then once we're happy with like is this is this part good? And we do that for all the parts. Once we're happy with that, then we need to UV pack all of the parts into this space. And the algorithm does most of that work. But, um, it's a two-step process. You can't pack stuff until you get it all properly unwrapped. Everybody with me there? Okay. So, let's do these other tubes over here. Let's check. Did I put caps on these? Looks like not. So, I'll again grab an inner one there and I'll mark a seam and then grab the other one over here. and mark seam. And let's do that part. So again, grab these. Ctrl L gives me all of those. And then I can right click and say unwrap. I'm just going to use angle base. Like we said, there's very minimal difference here. over here on these. This, I believe, goes the whole way down. Yep. So, we'll mark that seam over here. Mark this seam. And so, this um you should always do a good job modeling. You should just do a good job. Period. Right. But now it's going to matter way more because the when you're going to UV unwrap something, the threshold for quality modeling is raised, right? Unfortunately, you're the person doing both of those jobs here, right? So you in all these instances, you'll have no one to blame but yourself, but there'll be plenty of blame to go around, right? All of the selves can get blamed uh in terms of this. And you know, hopefully we've checked this stuff enough at this point that no one's way out of bounds here, but there's plenty of situations where I've modeled something or parts of something, gone to UV unwrap it, and was faint faced with the un comfortable truth that my modeling was not great. And if I wanted to have some sort of reasonable unwrap of this, I would need to go back and make adjustments. Okay? And there's just no two ways about it. That's always super, you know, it's just the way a lot of this goes. And so, let's grab these here and these here. And then again, Ctrl Lives need all of them. Right click and we can unwrap those. And there we go. Since the two of them next to each other there, laid out nice and nice and nice and flat. Uh, good. And then let's look at what we can do for our cubes here. And so here, um, these are cubes laid out in space. And so we might be able to get away with algorithmic approach to these. Let's see. Um if we grab all all of them or a portion of them and controll L and kind of see what's happening um control L okay what is happening what do you what let's look and see what's happening here if I Look at the cubes with the checker on. What is the checker telling me? >> It's a little squish, but then also what what's happening to each stair? >> Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, they're over overlapping. Okay. So in this case for something like this stair and for objects that you create using the array modifier the automatically generated UVs once you take the array modifier and make it um once you apply it you'll get UVs like this out of the box. This would be usable, okay, in that the constraining factor would be that all of the stairs would get the same pixels applied to each other. In some instances, that could be fine, right? if you wanted to. But if you wanted to put like, you know, paint splatter or spilled Kool-Aid on some of the stairs but not other stairs, that would not be possible given the UV map because the all of them are receiving the exact same pixels there. Does that make sense? Okay. So, in our case, what we're what we're going to work towards here is that we're gonna have a we're going to paint a nice playground and then to get to have some fun with Substance Painter, we're gonna like, you know, graffiti it up and make a, you know, na nasty playground. Um, and so we're going to want to be able to, you know, take our digital spray paint and just go all over the whole thing and have it look like that's what someone did, right? And um, so in that case, we do want to separate these out, but not in that would not be always the case. There may be plenty of situations where it' be totally reasonable to do this. Leaves on a tree are one instance for sure where you know it does not doesn't make a lot of sense to separate all the leaves. In fact, we'll make a plant at some point here coming up. Yeah. It's been weeks now for a while and I just know where >> like you're feeling the floor vibrate. >> No, the table vibrates. It feels like my phone. >> Oh. Oh, >> my phone. >> It's your phone. >> Yeah. >> Oh, okay. Yeah. >> Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, yeah. Okay. So, let's uh separate this out."

    "search_text": "AVC185 September 22, 2025 UV Island Packing and right click and say unwrap. There we go. And so now we have unwrapped all of the parts. If I press A, we have a totally unusable UV map. Why is it unusable? Because like all of the parts that are unwrapped well are overlapping each other in space, right? So we're close. we should save. Um, and this will be in the correct folder. Slide unwrap. And now the packing. Right. So we just need to separate all these out into the UV space. Fortunately, this is a job for computers that computers do well. So if we come back over here and grab all of them and come over save before this because this this running this algorithm has been dicey sometimes. Um and so over here uh pack islands. Okay, so remember each essentially that's our problem. We have a bunch of islands. The islands individually look good, but the islands are overlapping each other and so we need to pack them. And so pack islands opens up this dialogue and shape method. Uh we're saying that yes, you can scale the islands. Yes, you can rotate the islands. Um, and that we'll go with that for now and see what comes back. Boom. Right. And so you see that it u divides everything up here and tries to spread it across the space. The this is functional, right? There's no overlapping. We have Let's check out our distortion in general. Fairly good, right? Things aren't hyper distorted. Um, Blinka, what do you think? What's some What's a downside to the way this is unwrapped right now? That's >> Yeah, I mean there's some that's definitely it could do a better job there, but especially because these are squares. Um, what else? What do you think in terms of like the proportionality of it? >> Yeah. So over let's actually we'll be able to see this much clearer when we look at the when we turn off play mode. Look at it over here. Turn this off and look at this. Go back to here. And yeah, so the numbers are really big here. So meaning that this is not getting that much space. And then these caps that we made are really big in the um look how much space they're taking up, right? Which is not proportional there. Uh and so that's if anything we want the main chunk of the slide to be to get way more love in the um UV space here. So let's uh select all these and come back and look at that island again. Um below it we have average island scale. So again the you'll get really weird results unless you applied scale and made sure the slide was at 111 which is what we've been emphasizing. I mean in general in Blender if you don't apply scale you're gonna get weird results constantly. So like you just have to do that. Um, and so now before we run the pack, we'll tell it to average the island scale. And boom. See what happened there? The big part of the slide is now big and the caps are now small, right? And so now we will tell it to go back and redo the pack islands. We'll see what it does. Usually it does a better job of respecting them. Maybe it gives us the same result. In which case we can go back and average the scale again and then tell it, hey, don't mess with the scale here. Keep them proportional. But let's see what it does. Better. It's rotating them. Uh, and you know, seems like it could be less space there. I'm going to control Z that. And let's try to run this and say try it but don't rotate. See if it makes any better use of space. I would take this over that. You know why? because um a lot of times, especially if you're going to use any sort of repeating patterns, um having the majority of things oriented in a discernable direction in UV space um makes applying a pattern across it certainly a little bit easier. This left a lot of space on the floor here. Um and so let's try it again. See if we can get anything better. I mean, part of it is that a lot of our poles here are these long continuous things. So is our uh slide. And so, you know, maybe like we did with the cylinder, cutting the slide in half so that these islands could be broken up would allow the packing to take much better use, make much better use of all the you just get much better tixel density. So um let's try that. So over here we can do the same thing like if I come over here and press ctr L it gives me the whole part and it left off the caps. Okay, good. I wasn't expecting that. I thought it would not do that, but that works. I thought we'd have to select it over here to do it over there, but and I don't have that linked right now. So, here I'm going to do this one. Let's mark a seam there. Then grab this. Ctrl L. Make sure that we don't have the caps. And then rerun our unwrap on that part. Is it grabbing the caps? No. Oh, it's that that other seam. Um I deselected it. So, we need to we That was the sock problem where it um got all of them. There we go. And so, now I do this and control L. There we go. And again, run the unwrap. There we go. Right. And so it's split them into more squareish chunks. Right. What shape best fits best into a square? A square. Right. Right. We don't want the quintessential round peg and square hole problem or whichever way that goes. Um, and so there we go. Let's grab everything. Let's go back and average island size. There we go. And then let's go back and pack islands and pack and a little bit better. Let's look at the pack islands again. Um, let's say yes, you can rotate. Try it again. That's better. We still got some space here. We could address some of this ourselves, right? So, especially once everything gets kind of uh distinctly wrapped up here, right? In fact, it's making me kind of question the algorithm. If I grab this much and control L, right, that gives me my individual islands. I can s scale this up and do my own human algorithm of fitting stuff in other stuff. >> Yeah, there's definitely, you know, levels of of algorithm here. I know this gets better. At one point, Cinema 4D bought a separate company that had started to just do this stuff, which had an awesome name. They they had called their company um Ministry of Flat, which you know, it's like that could be your band name. Um usually these these 3D companies are not that cool, you know, like Cinema 4D, you know, even Blender is I mean I guess the coolest of them. Um anyways, so that takes up considerably more gives us better tixel density. Let's see if we can push it a little bit more. >> Control. I'll look at some of the other ones. This is UV tool kit, but yeah, there's a bunch of other I don't um yeah, we could make some of them perfectly square. You may end up with some distortion there, but this is totally, you know, again, it's more of an art than a science, man. Um like this is totally going to work. Um because we don't, you know, our fundamental requirements are met. It's not overlapping. It's minimal distortion. uh seams make sense. We have reasonable pixel density, tixel density and looking good. And so this is ready for you know the next level painting in substance painter um where we can paint it. Maybe we'll do a little painting here just to show how that works. But we'll then go to substance painter. All right. So deep dive into texal texture coordinate space and UV unwrapping. So a lot to digest there but we'll keep going. All right, see",
